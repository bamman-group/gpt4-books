<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mary	He became less serious, and rather less dictatorial at home, for he was apt to hear [MASK] laughing at him, and telling him, as she was fond of doing, that he knew nothing at all about anything.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Mary	“It’s not a question of friendship,” [MASK] exclaimed, her anger rising, to her own surprise. “You know it’s not. How can it be? I’ve no right to interfere--” She stopped.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Katharine	He glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her chairs and tables; they were solid, for he grasped the back of the chair in which [MASK] had sat; and yet they were unreal; the atmosphere was that of a dream.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Katharine	“[MASK],” she said, lifting it in the air, “I’ve just made out such a queer, strange thing about your grandfather. I’m three years and six months older than he was when he died.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Katharine	“Style, you know, is what we tend to neglect--“; but he was far more conscious of [MASK]’s eye upon him than of what he was saying about style. He knew that she was looking at him, but whether with irritation or indifference he could not guess.
<name>he</name>	he	Katharine	Directly he had done speaking she burst out: “But surely, if you care about the welfare of your sex at all, you must wish them to have the vote?” “I never said I didn’t wish them to have the vote,” [MASK] protested.
<name>he</name>	he	Katharine	Either to propitiate them, or to show his consideration for their feelings, he proceeded to offer them the apple which he held. The sight, unfortunately, was so comically apt in its illustration of the picture in her mind, the ruse was so transparent, that [MASK] was seized with laughter.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Mary	No, [MASK] thought, with unflinching loyalty to what appeared to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, I do not mean to pretend that any other view does instead. Whatever happens, I mean to have no presences in my life.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Katharine	He tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping up the partitions of the mind, until he could decently go home; but a little to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently, as if from outside, by [MASK], that he launched forth desperately into an imaginary interview with her.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Katharine	Nor was the sonnet, in spite of its accomplishment, lacking in passion, and [MASK], as she read the pages through again, could see in what direction her feelings ought to flow, supposing they revealed themselves.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Katharine	“A little--because he’s connected with you.” [MASK] smiled. “But then, with your well-known fidelity, considering that you’re staying here at least a fortnight, you won’t have any illusions left about me by the time you go.
<name>St. Teresa</name>	St. Teresa	Mary	From an acute consciousness of herself as an individual, [MASK] passed to a conception of the scheme of things in which, as a human being, she must have her share. She half held a vision; the vision shaped and dwindled.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Katharine	But the book must be written. It was a duty that they owed the world, and to [MASK], at least, it meant more than that, for if they could not between them get this one book accomplished they had no right to their privileged position.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Katharine	“And we might be so happy, [MASK]!” he exclaimed impulsively, and drew her arm through his. She withdrew it directly. “As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy,” she said.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Katharine	But when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life, [MASK] felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no definite reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing in every possible way.
<name>Lilla</name>	Lilla	Ralph	She wound her ivy spray round her ash-plant, and for the first time for many days, when alone with [MASK], set no spies upon her motives, sayings, and feelings, but surrendered herself to complete happiness.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Katharine	“Can you make her out?” [MASK] perceived from his little frown and hesitation that he did not find that particular problem to his taste at present. She stood upright at once and said in a different tone: “I really am off, though.
<name>the secretary</name>	the secretary	Mary	She was a little surprised to find that [MASK] had drawn her chair to the window, and, having lit the gas, she raised herself from a stooping posture and looked at her. The most obvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind of indisposition.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Katharine	I must write the man’s name down at once, or I shall forget--” Whose name, what book, which life was changed [MASK] proceeded to ascertain. She began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly, for she was very late. “May I sit and watch you?”
<name>Caspar</name>	Caspar	Ralph	“If you don’t want to marry me,” [MASK] now began again, without abruptness, with diffidence rather, “there is no need why we should cease to see each other, is there? Or would you rather that we should keep apart for the present?”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Katharine	[MASK] made no reply and seemed unaware of her words. She seemed absorbed in her own thoughts. “Perhaps he’s waiting in the street again to-night,” she exclaimed. “I’ll go now. I might find him.”
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Henry	“No, never,” she repeated obstinately. “Not rightly. Don’t you see, I didn’t know what I was doing?” “You love some one else?” he cut her short. “Absolutely no one.” “[MASK]?”
<name>botanists</name>	botanists	Chelsea	He did this with the peculiar touch of the botanist. In naming the little green plant to her he used the Latin name, thus disguising some flower familiar even to [MASK], and making her exclaim, half in amusement, at his knowledge.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Katharine	He nodded his head, and said, nervously, “Yes, yes,” and looked at [MASK], and thought how beautiful she looked; there was no one in the world that he admired more. There was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he had never seen there.
<name>John</name>	John	Ralph	She had noticed [MASK]’s coldness, too. She looked at him, and from his fixed stare she thought that he must be working out some theory, some argument. He had thought, perhaps, of some fresh point in his position, as to the bounds of personal liberty.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Joan	A feeling of great intimacy united the brother and sister, and the semicircular lines above their eyebrows disappeared. No, there was nothing more to be said on either side. [MASK] brushed her brother’s head with her hand as she passed him, murmured good night, and left the room.
<name>She</name>	She	Cassandra	“As late as that! Well--?” She did not understand. “At twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go. The illusion fades. But I accept my fate. I make hay while the sun shines.” [MASK] looked at her with a puzzled expression.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Rodney	You’ll both help me. In fact, we’ll help each other. That’s a Christian doctrine, isn’t it?” “It sounds more like Paganism to me,” [MASK] groaned, as he reviewed the situation into which her Christian doctrine was plunging them.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Rodney	But the desire to communicate something of the very greatest importance possessed him completely; he still wished to bestow this gift upon some other human being; he sought their company. More by instinct than by conscious choice, he took the direction which led to [MASK]’s rooms.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	William	She could not deny that the surface of her feeling was absolutely unruffled by anything in [MASK]’s character; on the contrary, she felt certain that she could deal with whatever turned up. He gave her peace, in which she could think of things that were far removed from what they talked about.
<name>She</name>	She	William	At any rate [MASK] made no answer. She waited stoically. A moment later he stepped briskly from his dressing-room, and observed that if she wanted to buy more oysters he thought he knew where they could find a fishmonger’s shop still open.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Shakespeare	They came strangely close together sometimes. But, while she hesitated and sought for words not too direct, her mother had recourse to [MASK], and turned page after page, set upon finding some quotation which said all this about love far, far better than she could.
<name>Beatrice</name>	Beatrice	Katharine	He stood watching her come towards him, and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream of her; for the real [MASK] could speak the words which seemed to crowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes, and the commonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Katharine	she asked, a moment later. “Mares’ tails, I believe,” he hazarded. “Have you ever been down a coal-mine?” she went on. “Don’t let’s talk about coal-mines, [MASK],” he protested.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	William	“Why can’t I share with you? Why am I so mean? I know why it is,” she added. “We understand each other, [MASK] and I. You’ve never understood each other. You’re too different.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Katharine	She protested almost plaintively when [MASK] proposed to go upstairs. “I’ve something that I want to say to you in PRIVATE,” she said, hesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush. “The drawing-room is empty--”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Mary	Like most people, I suppose, I’ve lived almost entirely among delusions, and now I’m at the awkward stage of finding it out. I want another delusion to go on with. That’s what my unhappiness amounts to, [MASK].”
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Ralph	Oh, yes, [MASK] had come in at that point. She scored that sheet very effectively, and, choosing a fresh one, began at a great rate with a generalization upon the structure of human society, which was a good deal bolder than her custom.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Katharine	Perhaps if you married me--I’m half a poet, you see, and I can’t pretend not to feel what I do feel. If I could write--ah, that would be another matter. I shouldn’t bother you to marry me then, [MASK].”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rodney	Her blindness in the case of [MASK], her attempt to match his true feeling with her false feeling, was a failure never to be sufficiently condemned; indeed, she could only pay it the tribute of leaving it a black and naked landmark unburied by attempt at oblivion or excuse.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	William	He drew the curtain instantly, and she made no attempt to stop him. Their eyes at once sought the same spot beneath the lamp-post. “He’s not there!” she exclaimed. No one was there. [MASK] threw the window up and looked out.
<name>Lady Catherine</name>	Lady Catherine	Ralph	“A smaller house?” “Fewer servants, perhaps.” Neither brother nor sister spoke with much conviction, and after reflecting for a moment what these proposed reforms in a strictly economical household meant, [MASK] announced very decidedly: “It’s out of the question.”
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Mamma	The love of husband and wife is the most holy we know. That is the lesson [MASK]’s children learnt from her; that is what they can never forget. I have tried to speak as she would have wished her daughter to speak. You are her grandchild.”
<name>Dorothea</name>	Dorothea	Mary	I wonder how it is that they don’t see it?” She was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke, so that her sentences were more than usually broken apart. [MASK] could not help looking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something like admiration.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mary	There! Didn’t you hear them say, ‘Insurance Bill’?” “I wonder why men always talk about politics?” [MASK] speculated. “I suppose, if we had votes, we should, too.” “I dare say we should.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Katharine	“Our quarrel was perfectly hateful to me. I’ve not slept all night. You’re not angry with me, are you, [MASK]?” She could not bring herself to answer him until she had rid her mind of the impression that her aunt had made on her.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Katharine	“There has been a change in the last few weeks. You owe it to me to be honest, [MASK].” “If I could, I would,” she replied. “Why did you tell me you would marry me, then?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ralph	It might have been due merely to politeness, but [MASK] felt that she received him almost with cordiality. Perhaps she was bored by drinking tea and reading a book all alone; at any rate, she tossed the book on to a sofa with a gesture of relief.
<name>He</name>	He	Ralph	she asked, almost with impatience, tapping her spoon two or three times against the side of her cup. “Why?” [MASK] laid hands on the first words that came to mind. “Because, I suppose, it keeps an ideal alive which might die otherwise.”
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Katharine	[MASK] took the sheets from her mother’s hand and began shuffling them absent-mindedly together, for her fixed gaze seemed to show that her thoughts were intent upon some other matter. “Well, I don’t know about ugliness,” she said at length.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	She lay back in her corner, silent and apparently exhausted. [MASK], in spite of her own preoccupation, was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection. “I’m sure we shall find him,” she said more gently than she had yet spoken.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Joan	There’s nothing left for you to eat,” broke up the oppressive concentration of so many eyes upon the table-cloth, and set the waters of family life dashing in brisk little waves again. It was obvious that [MASK] had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	William	She laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly way, and said: “Come and sit down, [MASK]. How glad I was you were here! I felt myself getting ruder and ruder.” “You are not good at hiding your feelings,” he returned dryly.
<name>Clym</name>	Clym	Katharine	By a considerable effort of self-control he forced himself to remain silent, and to make himself distinguish what part of his pain was due to vanity, what part to the certainty that no woman really loving him could speak thus. “What do I feel about [MASK]?”
<name>music</name>	music	Emerson	“You always say that,” she said. “I assure you it’s a common ‘combination,’ as you call it, in the houses of the clergy. The only thing that’s odd about me is that I enjoy them both--[MASK] and the stocking.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to make an educated guess about the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to make an educated guess about the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Katharine	He was scarcely addressing her, and she said nothing. For a moment they stood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing. Then he asked her quickly, “But tell me, how did it seem to you? What did you think, [MASK]?
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Henry	“Do they know what coals are made of, [MASK]?” she asked, a moment later. “Mares’ tails, I believe,” he hazarded. “Have you ever been down a coal-mine?” she went on.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Katharine	Nothing’s been touched,” said [MASK]. “Everything’s exactly the same.” But as she said this, with a decision which seemed to make it imply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held out a cup into which she had forgotten to pour any tea.
<name>Spinner</name>	Spinner	Katharine	[MASK], thus, was a member of a very great profession which has, as yet, no title and very little recognition, although the labor of mill and factory is, perhaps, no more severe and the results of less benefit to the world.
<name>Miss Taylor</name>	Miss Taylor	Ralph	While talking exclusively of what they saw, so that any one might have overheard them, they felt that the compact between them was made firmer and deeper by the number of people who passed them and suspected nothing of the kind. The question of [MASK]’s cottage and future was not mentioned again.
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	He didn’t like it.... But then I have a sister, and you haven’t, have you?” “No, I haven’t any sisters.” “You are writing a life of your grandfather?” [MASK] pursued.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Ralph	You looked as if you were walking in your sleep,” she said. “Are you arranging some terrible love affair? Have you got to reconcile a desperate couple?” “I wasn’t thinking about my work,” [MASK] replied, rather hastily.
<name>Aslan</name>	Aslan	Katharine	“I should say a quick, impatient temper. Most, in fact ALL great men have had bad tempers--except your grandfather, [MASK],” and here she sighed, and suggested that, perhaps, she ought to go down to the library.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Henry	“That certainly seems to explain some of your actions,” [MASK] thought to himself. “One thing’s about as good as another, and one’s got to do something,” he said aloud, expressing what he supposed to be her attitude, much in
<name>Mr. Casaubon</name>	Mr. Casaubon	Katharine	And, as she smoothed down the sheet of blotting-paper over the manuscript, she braced herself to resist [MASK], whose presence struck her, not merely by its force, as usual, but as something in the nature of a menace.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Henry	I want to have a house of my own. It isn’t possible at home. It’s all very well for you, [MASK]; you can go your own way. I have to be there always. Besides, you know what our house is.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Mary	He was trapped by the illogicality of human life. The obstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial, and yet he could see no way of removing them. [MASK]’s words, the tone of her voice even, angered him, for she would not help him.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Katharine	No good had ever come to him from [MASK]; his whole relationship with her had been made up of dreams; and as he thought of the little substance there had been in his dreams he began to lay the blame of the present catastrophe upon his dreams.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Cassandra	“But no one knows it but ourselves.” “But why--I don’t understand--you’re not engaged!” [MASK] said again. “Oh, that explains it! You’re not in love with him! You don’t want to marry him!”
<name>her sister</name>	her sister	Cassandra	She had only to look at [MASK] to see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means. She considered for a moment, and then said: “If you don’t want to tell people yourselves, I’ll do it for you.
<name>him</name>	him	Ralph	It was borne in upon her how completely in running her risk she had lost her prize, lost it so entirely that she had no longer the right, in talking of [MASK], to presume that her knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge.
<name>Blackwood</name>	Blackwood	Poets	Above her nursery fireplace hung a photograph of her grandfather’s tomb in [MASK]’ Corner, and she was told in one of those moments of grown-up confidence which are so tremendously impressive to the child’s mind, that he was buried there because he was a “good and great man.”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Mary	Like most intelligent people, [MASK] was something of an egoist, to the extent, that is, of attaching great importance to what she felt, and she was by nature enough of a moralist to like to make certain, from time to time, that her feelings were creditable to her.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Mary	Can you make any sense of it? Can you see what’s happened? I’m raving, I know; don’t listen, [MASK]; go on with your work.” He rose and began, as usual, to pace up and down the room.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Mary	“You’re right, [MASK],” he said, with something of an effort, “though I don’t know how you guessed it.” She was silent, hoping that he might tell her the reason of his unhappiness, for his excuses had not deceived her.
<name>he</name>	he	Cassandra	It was clear that he was greatly relieved. He looked round him now, as if he felt at his ease, and [MASK] exclaimed: “Don’t you think everything looks quite different?” “You’ve moved the sofa?” he asked. “No.
<name>Clym</name>	Clym	Katharine	“Ah, but can I allow that?” he exclaimed. “It would mean--for we must face it, [MASK]--that we let our engagement stand for the time nominally; in fact, of course, your freedom would be absolute.”
<name>Kew</name>	Kew	Kew	He took it down from the shelf and found the picture. To this he added a note from her, bidding him meet her at the Zoo. He had a flower which he had picked at [MASK] to teach her botany. Such were his relics.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Henry	Observing this, [MASK] remarked: “Perhaps marriage will make you more human.” At this she lowered the newspaper an inch or two, but said nothing. Indeed, she sat quite silent for over a minute.
<name>He</name>	He	Denham	With their eyes fixed upon the opposite side of the road, they did not notice a figure close to the railing which divided the garden from the street. But [MASK] had crossed the road and was standing there. They were startled by his voice close at hand.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Katharine	Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to feelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than to our feelings as individuals, and [MASK] knew that only some one of her own age could follow her meaning.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mary	He fell into one of his queer silences, which seemed to [MASK], in spite of all her precautions, to have reference to what she also could not prevent herself from thinking about--their feeling for each other and their relationship.
<name>Cthulhu</name>	Cthulhu	Mary	To see [MASK] was to risk the destruction of this globe. “Did you treat her badly?” she asked rather mechanically, walking on. “I could defend myself,” he said, almost defiantly. “But what’s the use, if one feels a thing?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Katharine	A slight rigidity had passed over [MASK]’s face. Her lips were pressed together; her eyes were contracted, and they were still fixed upon the curtain. These superficial changes covered an extreme inner loathing such as might follow the display of some hideous or indecent spectacle.
<name>Mr. Gradgrind</name>	Mr. Gradgrind	Katharine	“She knows enough--enough for all decent purposes. What do you women want with learning, when you have so much else--everything, I should say--everything. Leave us something, eh, [MASK]?” “Leave you something?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Katharine	I was foolish. I let myself pretend.” Here she paused. “For, you see, [MASK],” she proceeded, rousing herself and speaking with greater energy, “I AM in love. There’s no doubt about that....
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Cassandra	[MASK]’s dislike of rational society, she said, was an affectation fast hardening into a prejudice, which would, in the long run, isolate her from all interesting people and pursuits. She was finishing the sheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually struck upon her ears.
<name>Grandmother</name>	Grandmother	Katharine	I have tried to speak as she would have wished her daughter to speak. You are her grandchild.” [MASK] seemed to judge this defence upon its merits, and then to convict it of falsity. “I don’t see that there is any excuse for your behavior,” she said.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Katharine	It’s only marriage that’s out of the question,” [MASK] replied. “But if I find myself coming to want you more and more?” “If our lapses come more and more often?” He sighed impatiently, and said nothing for a moment.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Katharine	In the first place she called them to witness that the room was darker than usual, and had all the lights turned on. “That’s more cheerful,” she exclaimed. “D’you know, [MASK], that ridiculous goose came to tea with me?
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Katharine	“He’s about done for himself, I should say,” he continued. Without saying anything, he took [MASK]’s letters out of her hand, adjusted his eyeglasses, and read them through. At length he said “Humph!” and gave the letters back to her.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Katharine	“I’ve only been here about ten minutes,” she replied. “My dear [MASK], you left the drawing-room over an hour ago.” She said nothing. “Does it very much matter?”
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Ralph	She left the room at once. Her heart beat fast at the knowledge of [MASK]’s presence; but it beat with pain, and with an extraordinary fear. She stood listening for a moment to the voices in the next room.
<name>Annabella</name>	Annabella	Susan	[MASK] her name was--to have him to stay in the village. They abused her goodness, I’m sorry to say, and while they walked in the lanes, they stood the perambulator alone in a field where there was a bull.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Katharine	“We fine her a penny each time she forgets, and the fines go to buying a plum cake,” she explained, seeking to draw [MASK] into the community. She had given up all hope of impressing her.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Rodney	The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it directly. Had [MASK] spoken those words? “You love her.” Was that his own voice, which seemed to sound in the air several yards in front of him?
<name>He</name>	He	William	“There’s more of the old maid in you than the poet,” she observed briefly. [MASK] shut the door sharply, gave the address to the driver, and turned away, lifting his hat punctiliously high in farewell to the invisible lady.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Katharine	The paint had so faded that very little but the beautiful large eyes were left, dark in the surrounding dimness. [MASK] waited as though for him to receive a full impression, and then she said: “This is his writing-table.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Katharine	In his surprise at the suddenness of the change, and at the extent of his freedom, he bethought him of a daring plan, by which the ghost of [MASK] could be more effectually exorcised than by mere abstinence. He would ask her to come home with him to tea.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Katharine	accumulated, which he must lay before [MASK], for she alone could help him now. Unless he could see her alone, it would be impossible for him ever to sleep, or to know what he had said in a moment of madness, which was not altogether mad, or was it mad?
