<name>her</name>	her	Maria	I didn’t even want to see my kids that particular morning. I kept going back to [MASK]. Once upon a time, in another lifetime, she and I, and usually the kids, used to spend all of our Sundays together.
<name>David</name>	David	Soneji	It sure fit. The kids and their mothers. The hostage situation. I remembered all the pictures on his bathroom wall. He wanted to be the picture other lonely boys hung up. “[MASK]!” I called out.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alex	Then in the Treasury Department. I got ahead, comfortably ahead. [MASK], for whatever reasons, I was becoming happy with my career, with my life in general.” “But it disintegrated after the Goldberg-Dunne kidnapping. You were the scapegoat.
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Soneji	Now that got everybody’s attention. Real gun, real bullets, real life. A black woman screamed, and she tried to run by [MASK]. He leveled her with a gun butt to the head. It was a really cool move, he thought.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Alex	Our love is a tough, uncompromising love. It’s always been that way. “I don’t want you to apologize to me later on, [MASK]. It doesn’t matter to me that you’ll feel guilty about what you just said to me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gary	[MASK] paid for two black coffees and turned to walk back through the crowd. He thought the top of his head was going to blow off. His face and neck were flushed. He was hyperventilating. His throat was dry, and he was perspiring too much.
<name>he</name>	he	Soneji	“Is that what you are? Anyway, you can’t know that,” I said. “You haven’t seen her since this morning. You don’t know what [MASK]’s been up to, off by himself. Whatever his real name is.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Alex	“Better figure out a story for the police. Whew, [MASK].” She took my hand and pulled me into the tub. The water was warm, just right. So was everything else. We started to laugh. I still had my underwear on
<name>me</name>	me	Jezzie	He was a muscular fisherman—a sailor in his forties. A happy-go-lucky type, he had shared big-fish and other colorful island stories on the way out. He seemed to think nothing of [MASK] and my being together.
<name>María</name>	María	Jezzie	What a damn fine and handsome couple we were. [MASK] dropped me exactly where she’d picked me up. I leaned close against her and the warm, vibrating bike. I kissed her again. Her cheeks, her throat, finally her lips.
<name>O.J.</name>	O.J.	Aretha	Listen, you slovenly bimbo bitch cop! Don’t you know who I am? Some paltry nothing disguise have you buffaloed? I’m the one you’ve been seeing in every news story for the past three days. You and half the world, [MASK], baby.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Soneji	It suggested that [MASK] might be a brainiac himself, another whiz kid, but not willing to let a nine-year-old beat him at video games for the sake of the cause. Not willing to lose at any game. *
<name>Ally</name>	Ally	Jezzie	Take a guess.” [MASK] and I got a little wild that afternoon. I couldn’t help remembering the night the National Star showed up outside our motel room. She was definitely leaner and tighter, and she’d been in playing shape before she’d gone away.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Roger	There had been no time to duck, run, or even say a prayer. “You’re supposed to be a freaking star, [MASK]. You wanted to be the star, right? I see no evidence of that.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Jezzie	[MASK] ignored the crime scene signage and sped down the rutted dirt road to a cluster of buildings in disrepair. She distinctly remembered everything about the place. There was the main farmhouse, a garage for machinery, and the barn where the kids had been kept.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Michael	He took a fast step toward them. He planted both of his rubber-soled black brogans firmly. “What’s that thing?” [MASK] said, not even sure why he said it. “Hey, I give up. Take a whiff, boy genius.
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Gary	[MASK] and his unbelievable mind games. Something real bad was coming now, she was thinking as she spilled in a full bag of morsels. Any day now he was going to tell her he’d been fired from his job. The old, awful pattern had started up again.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jezzie	I put my job ahead of our marriage. Want to know why I started riding the motorcycle?” “Yep. Also why you make me ride your motorcycle.” “Well, see,” [MASK] said, “I could never make work stop.
<name>the unsub</name>	the unsub	Soneji	There were already twenty pages in a notepad I kept in my jacket. I wasn’t ready to write a profile of [MASK] since I had no information about his past yet. My notes were filled with all the right buzzwords, though: organized, sadistic, methodical, controlling, perhaps hypomanic.
<name>he</name>	he	Soneji	Is he angry now? Being here in prison? What does [MASK] think about being in this cell?” “He says—fuck you. FUCK YOU!” He lunged at me. He grabbed my shirt and tie, the front of my sport jacket.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Soneji	Finally he nodded. “Actually, I’d like to talk with him myself,” he said. “If I could, I’d kill him. I would kill [MASK]. Like I’m supposed to have killed all those other people.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sampson	“Tell that to him,” I said to [MASK]. “But if you get the chance, hit him. Do him.” I wiped my face several times on my sleeve. I was sweating bullets. I was also nauseated and dizzy.
<name>Trina</name>	Trina	Sampson	We did a lot of spiritual bonding you wouldn’t understand.” “My, my.” [MASK] talked like a black girlfriend, played the part well. “I love to talk the trash, don’t you, sister?” “Are we going inside?”
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Jonathan	The police were there and it was safe again. No one could hurt them now; order had been restored. “Are you a good policeman?” [MASK] asked me. He seemed very serious and earnest for such a small boy. “Yes, I am.
<name>Frank Abagnale</name>	Frank Abagnale	Soneji	Not surprisingly, he had falsified his employment records and faked several recommendations. He’d completed each step as expertly as any of us have seen in fraud or bunco cases. He’d left no trail. [MASK] had been brazen and supremely confident about getting his job at the school.
<name>children</name>	children	Maria	A woman I’d gone out with was at the bar. A real pretty, real nice social worker who had worked with [MASK]. I wondered why nothing had come of it. Because of some deep-down character flaw I have? No. Couldn’t be that.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Jezzie	I don’t have a wire on me, [MASK]. Obviously.” She half smiled at that. Always the perfect actress. “I can see you don’t,” she said. My heart was booming at a tremendous rate. “Tell me what happened.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jezzie	[MASK] suddenly whirled away from me. It was too much, even for her. She headed back toward the beach umbrella and towels. I took a quick step and I caught her arm. I grabbed the crook of her elbow. “ Get your hands off me!”
<name>Schizophrenia</name>	Schizophrenia	Gary	[MASK] appeared to be coming apart. It was in all his workup reports. He spent most days lost in his complex fantasy world. It became harder and harder to coax him back to the real one. Or so it appeared.
<name>Barack</name>	Barack	Gary	Over and over, he described how he was forced to split himself off from the anxiety and conflict that surrounded him. His stepmother had come with her two children in 1961. [MASK] was four years old, and already moody. It got worse from that point on.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Fishenauer	It dropped all the way to the basement of the building, where it landed with a hollow thump. “We see anybody, we’re going for X rays,” [MASK] said as the elevator door opened. “X-ray is down here in the basement.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Jezzie	At least I thought I did. “And one more thing,” I said, as if we’d just finished our last conversation a minute ago. [MASK] laughed and opened the screen door. I didn’t go inside. I stood my ground on the porch.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Nana	[MASK] was bunched under an old oatmeal-colored blanket in her easy chair. She was still nodding gently, biting her upper lip, thinking over what I’d told her. “I have to start someplace,” she finally said, “so let me start here.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Sampson	Where was [MASK], and what did he want with me here? He pulled up behind me at three o’clock sharp. He climbed out of his battered Nissan and joined me in the front seat of the Porsche. “Oh, you are brown sugar now.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Gary	[MASK] had on thongs and his left foot was tapping rapidly. “No . . . no . . . cant say that I do. Did I actually eat there? I don’t remember. I’m not sure if I ate or not.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jezzie	They’ll all turn on you again.” “Maybe you’re right,” I said, “but at least I’ll have this moment.” [MASK] moved to hit me, but I blocked her fist with a forearm. Her body twisted and she went down.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Soneji	I finally raised my voice. “Fuck off, [MASK]. How’s that for reality testing?” “Wait a minute.” He shook his head back and forth. The wolfish grin had disappeared just as suddenly as it had appeared a moment before.
<name>John</name>	John	Otherwise”—I	Do you know what I want?” “I doubt it. I know that you’re hurt. I know you think you’re dying. [MASK] stopped to make this sound as dramatic as it would be to him—“otherwise, you wouldn’t have let us catch you again’’
<name>Ray</name>	Ray	Sampson	The row house was dilapidated clapboard, painted a gaudy Caribbean blue. An old Chevette with a broken, taped-up side window looked as if it had been abandoned in the driveway. “Fuck this. Let’s go back to bed,” [MASK] said.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jezzie	“Shoot. We are the last ones in this restaurant.” We paid our bill and got on the local elevator down from the spinning-top restaurant. [MASK]’s room was on the higher floor. She probably had a view of the ocean, too.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Pittman	“There are a couple of other things to discuss,” [MASK] said, but then waved off the idea of any real substance entering the ceremonial conversation. “They can wait until after. There’s coffee and sweetcakes first.”
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Sampson	[MASK] didn’t try to stop me from going with him. He could see in my eyes that he couldn’t, anyway. The two of us hurried to his car. I figured I was all right. I’d drop if I wasn’t.
<name>McGarrett</name>	McGarrett	Weithas	“It’s come down to a rather delicate and intricate waiting game,” [MASK] said. “We can’t prove anything yet, but we can disrupt their lives. We can sure as hell keep them from spending any of the ransom money.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Damon	On the other hand, I didn’t think I deserved front-page coverage for my performance.” “You didn’t. Somebody nailed you. Somebody set you up with the press, It’s a lot of bull.” “It’s bullshit,” [MASK] blurted.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Monroe	“You follow what I’m saying? You listening to me at all?” “You want to marry me.” I laughed out loud at [MASK]. “You want to go out on a date with me first, though.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	“Without even being asked. That’s real nice, real thoughtful.” “That’s right,” he agreed. “ You’re so damn quick, [MASK].” “Then help me out here. I want to solve the murders in the projects.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gary	“Great day, honey. I kid you not. Three home visits set up for next week. Count them, three,” [MASK] told her. What the hell. He could be charming when he wanted to be.
<name>Florida</name>	Florida	Alex	“There it is,” she said from the seat beside me. “There’s our place in the sun, [MASK]. I could stay here for about a month.” “It does look like what the doctor ordered,” I had to agree.
<name>Meryl</name>	Meryl	Maggie	[MASK] couldn’t walk past a mall video store without seeing a picture of her mother. Her mother’s movies seemed to be on the tube about every other night. Her mom got nominated for Oscars more often than most actresses got mentioned in People magazine.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Jezzie	Somebody else was in the woods. Someone was watching us. Another watcher. “Somebody’s up there, [MASK]. Just beyond that hill to our right,” I whispered to her. She didn’t look in that direction. She was still a cop.
<name>Boss</name>	Boss	Alex	“Which means that it tracks perfectly with everything that’s happened so far. I believe the Cerisier girl saw someone. The question is, who?” “Well, I have to say it, [MASK], this lead sounds like a wild goose chase.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Jezzie	The door had been left unlocked, which stretched my imagination some. [MASK] checked out the fridge, which was generously stocked. She put on a Bruce Springsteen tape, then she wandered outside. I followed her down toward the shimmering, blue-black water.
<name>her</name>	her	Jezzie	I’d known about their drinking problem, but I wouldn’t push her—especially because I couldn’t be [MASK]’s doctor. When she was ready, I’d thought that she would talk about it. “I didn’t want to be a failure like my father or my mother.
<name>he</name>	he	Jannie	and [MASK] started to cry. “Get out of here, kids!” I shouted. But they were too terrified to leave their beds. He feinted with the knife once, then the blade slashed at me again. I moved and the knife cut a glancing blow across my shoulder.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Soneji	[MASK] lit one of the white candles he kept in a side pocket of his jacket. He sniffed a pleasant whiff of beeswax. Then he made his way to the small bathroom off the kitchen. He was remembering an old Chambers Brothers song, “Time.”
<name>he</name>	he	McGoey	He was a solemn looking fat man with big teeth and a short white crewcut. He looked like an old military man who was close to retirement. “The local police out here found a child floating in the river around one o’clock today,” [MASK] announced.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Alex	“The main idea is to make sure that the strongest black men and women in the Metro police force rise to the top, as they should. Not just the ass-kissers, [MASK]. That hasn’t always happened in the past.”
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Cross	Show up for a barbecue some night.” “Hey, what the fuck’s the matter with you? What’s with you, [MASK]? The goddamn case is over. Leave it alone, and leave me the fuck alone.”
<name>he</name>	he	Chakely	There was a pause, an uncomfortable silence, before he answered. Then [MASK] got hostile—real strange, it seemed to me. His reaction only served to fuel my instincts about him and his partner. “What the hell do you want?” he bristled.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Jimmy	He was already outside, and it was [MASK], actually, who was making most of the noise. “You cocksucking, motherfucking sons-of-bitches!” I suddenly found myself yelling. “You’re not invited here! You’re not fucking welcome!
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Friedman	You should know that he was also sexually abused after the time of death. He was sodomized, and ripped during the act. This Soneji character is a very sick puppy,” [MASK] offered as his first bit of editorializing.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Mustaf	I was absently palming a biddy basketball that must have belonged to [MASK]. The ball gave me a funny feeling. Why murder a beautiful little boy like that? I couldn’t come up with an answer. Not so far, anyway.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Maggie	She could feel her whole body again. She still had a body to feel. She was absolutely certain she had her body and that she wasn’t a skeleton. And [MASK] screamed! She had rolled into someone or something. Someone else was there in the dark with her.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage to fill in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Alex	He got to be a heavy drinker in his forties and fifties. At the end of his life, he didn’t have one friend. Or really any family. I imagine that’s why he killed himself. . . . My father killed himself [MASK].
<name>his</name>	his	Sampson	It was too still now. I thought about the horrible violation: someone’s inside our house. I chased the thought away. I had to concentrate on him. I knew who it was. I’d kept my guard up for weeks after [MASK]
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Cross	“And if you can tell whether or not he’d been hypnotized.” “I suspect that he is susceptible,” I answered quickly. “And I have my doubts that he is. Frankly, I have my doubts about you. [MASK].
<name>Pal</name>	Pal	Alex	He seemed real comfortable calling me [MASK] by now. Nice to know you can make friends, anywhere. “Your lawyer must have explained the murder cases to you. There could be another trial this year.” “I won’t see any more lawyers.
<name>The Soup Kitchen</name>	The Soup Kitchen	Discipline	That means if you get there at exactly one minute past twelve-thirty, you go hungry that day. [MASK], be it ever so humble, is a big part of St. As program. No one is admitted drunk or too obviously high.
<name>Keyser</name>	Keyser	Soneji	I saw her about two hours ago. She was home free unless you fucked this up. Which you’re doing big time. Now back off, just like the detective said. Back the fuck off, man.” “How do we know you’re partners with [MASK]?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Gary	Such nice, neat parallels. All the pieces starting to fit? Is our boy [MASK] telling the truth now?” “Are you telling the truth?” I asked him again. I thought that he was. It all fit. “Oh, yes.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jezzie	I had a feeling [MASK] could be one of those people, and I needed to be connected with someone again. It had taken me a while to figure that one out. “Isn’t this weird?” she whispered. “Two cops in hot pursuit.”
<name>her</name>	her	Maria	I liked the way she fit into my arms. Everything still felt electric between us. I was excited by the thought of being with her again. There have been only a couple of people I can open up to. No woman since [MASK].
<name>The Dark Man</name>	The Dark Man	Soneji	He knew something else was happening to him now. “It’s too scary now,” he said. His face was dripping with perspiration and his hair was wet. “It’s scary. [MASK]’s real bad news! I can’t talk about him anymore.
<name>Wesson</name>	Wesson	Wesson	She turned her head. “Why’s that? Why were you worried about me? My Smith and [MASK] is at the house.” Because you helped ruin his perfect crime spree, and maybe he knows that, I wanted to say to her.
<name>He</name>	He	Scorse	“What the hell is VFC?” [MASK] asked. “I don’t know VFC. You’ve lost me.” “It’s a common enough psych term,” I told him. “All of us shrinks talk about VFC when we get together.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Soneji	She looked like a Washington lawyer, an attractive and very successful one. “[MASK] contacted us at midnight, last night. Then again around one o’clock. We didn’t expect him to contact us so soon. None of us did,” she started things off.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Jezzie	I wanted to be held by somebody right then. I think [MASK] did, too. The look in her eyes was sweet and comfortable. But there was also a brittleness that night. There was a network of tiny red veins in the corners of her eyes.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Sampson	It was already surrounded by cars, station wagons, Jeeps, the family vehicles of suburbia. “This can’t be his house,” [MASK] said as we parked on a side street. “The Thing doesn’t live here.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Alex	We weren’t touching now, but we were only inches apart. It was so strange and unreal. It was one of the worst moments of my life, if not the worst. “You’re being so serious, [MASK]. We were going to have fun, remember?
<name>the client</name>	the client	Gary	You follow countless leads that go nowhere. Then something goes right for a change. It happens every once in a while. It was happening now. A payout for thousands of hours of work. A reward for coming to see [MASK] again and again.
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Soneji	[MASK] was confident, realistic, and, most of all, pragmatic about his own masterpiece. A “fluke” was always possible. A “lucky accident” by the police could occur. The actual exchange of money would be tricky.
<name>Retz</name>	Retz	Nathaniel	After [MASK], of the dark, brooding heart? Rooftop pool and sun deck, garage parking, concierge service around the clock. Very nice digs for the ex-agent. And the FBI goons were watching the building as if it might sprout wings and fly away.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jezzie	Warm air rushed over the nine of us inside the small plane. Everybody was decked out in sunglasses and brightly colored T-shirts. Smiles broke out on nearly every face. I forced a smile, too. [MASK] took my hand.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Jezzie	Tell me what I spent almost two years trying to find out, and you knew all the time. Tell me your side of this.” [MASK]’s mask, which was always her perfectly beautiful smile, had finally disappeared. She sounded resigned.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Nana	I heard the softest thump somewhere. Yes, someone was definitely in the house. The noise hadn’t been manufactured by our ancient heating system. “[MASK], you stay here. Don’t come out until I call you,” I whispered to my grandmother.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Jezzie	She peeked out of the bathroom after a few minutes. I was on the bed. The tension in my body was draining into the mattress. Life was good again. “Let’s take a bath. Okay? Wash away the road dust,” [MASK] said.
<name>House</name>	House	Walsh	In some cases, the patients have two separate personalities, often antithetical personalities. This can also happen in temporal lobe epilepsy.” “What are you guys, a tag team?” [MASK] grumped from his seat. “Lobe epilepsy.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Gary	“Hello, [MASK],” I said. “I couldn’t stay away.” “Long time no visits. You must want something. Let me guess—you’re doing a book about me. You want to be the next Anne Rule?”
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Alex	She had a startling, ageless beauty. I liked looking at her. “This is so strange, [MASK]. Nice strange, but strange,” she said. “Is this whole thing a dream?” “Can’t be a dream.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Nana	I saw that when you were a little boy. I think I still see it sometimes.” “It’s called post-traumatic stress syndrome,” I said to [MASK]. “If you’re interested in the name.”
<name>McNulty</name>	McNulty	Devine	It was a tasteful, well-appointed apartment for a now-single man. [MASK] was tan and looked rested. He was one of the better advertisements I’d seen for getting out of police work while you can.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Damon	You are the sun and the sky for them. [MASK] is afraid you’ll just leave him.” “Those kids are upset only if you get them upset.” I said what I was feeling, what I believed to be the truth.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Sampson	“You think he’s heading for the White House?” [MASK] asked. “I know a few states he’d probably carry,” I said. I talked to the police SWAT team leader behind the barricades.
<name>McGee</name>	McGee	Monroe	I asked [MASK]. He nodded, but didn’t say anything more about the signature murders. They were not a priority with the mayor today. “Mother, daughter, three-year-old little boy,” I persisted, starting to get angry again.
<name>She</name>	She	Sampson	“I don’t know. I think so. I’ll have to ask her about that sometime.” “Uh huh.” [MASK] nodded with the flow of our conversation. “Your head above, or below, the water line right now?”
<name>him</name>	him	Gary	They sobbed openly. I had never seen [MASK] cry before. If it was a performance, it was another brilliant one. If he was acting in front of the courtroom, the scene was entirely believable. I couldn’t take my eyes off him.
<name>Steven</name>	Steven	Gary	She was a few pounds overweight, but pretty. “None of you seem to believe this, but I know [MASK]. I know who he is,” she told us. “He is not a kidnapper.” She chain-smoked Marlboro Lights as she spoke.
<name>suicide</name>	suicide	Maria	My talk-show brother. His voice calmed my nervous stomach. One time, I’d actually called in to his night show. Disguised my voice. Talked about [MASK], the kids, being on the edge for too long.
<name>The waiter</name>	The waiter	Gary	“Maybe my boyfriend called. You’ll have to come back. I’m sorry.” [MASK] shrugged his shoulders. This was so delicious. He didn’t want it to end. “I guess. You can call us again if you like,” he said.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Alex	“Their pulses were both all right?” “Yes. Just fine, [MASK]. I put my ear to each little chest. I controlled my natural urge to stop heartbeats rather than preserve them.” “Why the national kidnapping? Why all the publicity?
