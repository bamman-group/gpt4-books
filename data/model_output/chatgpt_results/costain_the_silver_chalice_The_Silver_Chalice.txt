<name>Count Dracula</name>	Count Dracula	Linus	I had good reason for going to see her, and this much I will say: it was not interest in her that took me there. She told me then that she had sent me the note of warning about the intentions of [MASK]. I felt deeply indebted to her.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Basil	[MASK] was fully aware of the frigid intentness with which all seven were watching him. He indulged in a silent prayer. “O Lord, look down on me and lend me Thy help,” he said. “I am without experience in matters such as this.
<name>Mrs. Van Daan</name>	Mrs. Van Daan	Deborra	[MASK] turned her attention to the new arrivals. “They are nice young men. So quiet and gentle and so very humble. But you should see the bundles of clothing they brought with them; they are so pathetically small and cheap. I feel very sorry for them.”
<name>Eumaeus</name>	Eumaeus	Basil	I have been told to take you to the meeting and so I shall be there when the air is filled with the hailstones of invective. We must start as soon as you break your fast.” [MASK] began to bathe himself gratefully before the silver laver.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Tabitha	Then one night he rides down to her father’s house and gathers her up in his arms and takes her back with him. She rides behind him with her arms about his waist.” “She goes willingly, then?” “Oh yes, yes! [MASK] is very much in love with him.
<name>Turk</name>	Turk	Basil	He must be watching us from somewhere beyond the wall. Do you know, he has come to me three times in the last two days and asked questions about us.” “I was surprised to find his tents outside the walls,” said [MASK].
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Basil	During the first few hours he kept a close eye on the activities of the old man, noting how continuously he worked, and with what zest, as though he felt an urgency to serve. He slept, [MASK] discovered, under a metal lean-to at the rear of the house.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Raguel	The few stragglers they passed were like white wraiths, their feet plodding slowly, their heads sinking despondently forward. Even the cry of birds overhead was muted and seemed to come from a great distance. [MASK] raised his staff and pointed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Basil	Young man, young man, you would not trifle with anything as sacred as this? Are you telling me the truth?” “I have spoken the truth,” declared [MASK], laying a hand on his heart.
<name>Ibn Fadlan</name>	Ibn Fadlan	Linus	“You denied being sent here by [MASK]. That is false. You saw him last evening. You demanded one hundred dinars for the service he asked of you—to come here with this story—and it was finally agreed you were to receive eighty.
<name>Mamie</name>	Mamie	Zenobia	[MASK], bring my box.” It proved to be a very large box, made of an Eastern wood that filled the room with an aromatic odor. From inside it the matron, who clearly owed some of her beauty to the use of its contents, produced a great variety of jade and silver bottles.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Herod	How would that magnificently wicked queen Jezebel enjoy living in the sour mind of a tattling, nagging woman? How would [MASK], the greatest sinner of all, bear the stupidities of a dull, grasping merchant with no thought beside the price of dried fish?”
<name>Miss Murdstone</name>	Miss Murdstone	Sosthene	She whisked up the tray with an angry motion, spilling the milk on the floor, and stamped out. Never in the two years that he had existed in the house of [MASK] had the bitter shrew who ruled it been unable to carry his meals to him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	“I heard much talk of [MASK], but it was not permitted me to speak to him in his prison cell. It was a matter of much regret to this insignificant seeker after the truth who has heard that the tongue of the apostle is like a blade of the sharpest edge.”
<name>Mrs. Birling</name>	Mrs. Birling	Helena	“The truth of what I say is known to every guest who sits here tonight,” declared [MASK]. “I have dared to speak. Perhaps now there are others who will come forward and say that they know the situation to be a serious one.”
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Luke	This he held out to [MASK]. “I beg you to do me a favor. Give this to our not too devoted bridegroom. I told you that I cheated him when we dickered for the two camels. This contains what I received in excess of their real value.”
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Basil	If [MASK] had been there he would have recognized at once the fine brow and widely spaced eyes under the tray and so have identified the visitor as the vendor of sweetmeats who had paused once under the aliyyah of the house of Ignatius to deliver a surreptitious message to a customer.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Deborra	Only six members of the household were admitted as witnesses, and the rest were under the most stern injunction to remain in their rooms. The chosen six stood in a line facing the canopy when [MASK] entered and took her stand there.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hananiah	“It was years ago, but I remember it very well because I saw something at the same time that I was not supposed to see.” He proceeded to tell of the passing of the note, and [MASK] smiled as his own recollection went back to the episode.
<name>God</name>	God	Jehovah	“Farewell. May [MASK] look down on you and give you His protection.” CHAPTER XVII T JLhat first night the two riders drove on steadily through the darkness, then through the glory of the dawn and on into the freshness of the hours of early morning.
<name>He</name>	He	Basil	An eternity seemed to pass, an eternity spent in a steaming caldron. [MASK] clung to the pommel with his numb fingers and managed to keep from falling. It was clear to him, however, that sooner or later he would lose consciousness and drop from his high elevation to the ground.
<name>Sherlock Holmes</name>	Sherlock Holmes	Paul	I never see a hint of moisture in the eyes of [MASK]. That great man of logical mind knows it is weakness to cry out for those who have passed on to a better life. “We are weak creatures,” he continued after a moment, “and we repine for what we have lost.
<name>George</name>	George	Basil	We should not be talking about our misfortunes; we should be planning ways of meeting them. But I cannot get anything clear in my mind. Oh, if I could only think!” [MASK] seated himself on the side of the bed.
<name>Solomon</name>	Solomon	Caesar	“Summon us before you to show what we can do. 1 have certain wonders to perform. Let them do these miracles of which we hear so much. You, O [MASK], to be the judge between us. I am weary of the din they raise.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adam	The canvas flap had been drawn over the entrance, so there was almost complete darkness inside the tent. No one spoke or moved. It was [MASK] who broke the silence finally. “I can see nothing,” he said. “Can we not have some light?”
<name>Icarus</name>	Icarus	Tigellinus	“The dignity of the throne must be protected. Do as I bid you, [MASK] ” The captain of the Guard proceeded to carry out this order. He yanked the sandals from her without ceremony, then he turned her about and tore the wings from her shoulders.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Deborra	[MASK] hesitated before going on, having difficulty seemingly in expressing what was in her mind. “A time is coming----” she began. Then she stopped and glanced about her uncertainly. “I don’t know how my grandfather would have said this.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Adam	“My men are coming in now. Remember, all of you, what I have said. I want you to realize that you will pay ten times over for any hurt that may come to them.” [MASK] began to laugh at this point.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Jabez	“But we must not sit down and repine. We must make every effort to repair the disaster that has befallen us. Do what you can, my son. I will send word also to [MASK], who may be able to stir the police to greater efforts on our behalf.”
<name>oh wise one</name>	oh wise one	Shammai	“Their feet will never linger enough to suffer from sand burns. It is true that some of them are old, but is it not said with great truth that a strong old camel carries the hides of many young ones?” “It is a wise saying, [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Basil	It seemed now no different from any other drinking vessel of the same kind. It had been shaped in great haste and it was entirely without decoration. The light that had radiated from it before had departed. [MASK] touched a broken section of the lip with one finger.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Jabez	He would regard any reference to the thick sandals he wears as a personal insult. On the other hand, he is always gratified when the beauty of his wife is mentioned. She is a statuesque creature and rules [MASK] with a rod of iron—inside the house.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Marianne	she would say. Or, “[MASK], have your feet gone to sleep? Hurry, child!” To spare them the discomfort of all this confusion, the two visitors were shown into a smaller room, which contained the bed of the lady of the house.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Adam	[MASK] gave him a final shake and let him go. He said, walking to the door with such vigorous strides that he scattered the accumulations of equipment that stood in his way, “You may have redeemed yourself for the harm you did before.”
<name>She</name>	She	Simon	she asked. He answered that he had not. [MASK] had been always in his range of vision, but he had caught no glimpse of her. “I could see you,” she said. “You were very diligent. I watched you all the time.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ignatius	Had there been a meal afterward of five courses and had five of the finest wines been served as asserted? He had no recollection of a meal of any kind. Was it true that [MASK] had given to each of the five witnesses a belt buckle of silver?
<name>Nikola</name>	Nikola	Basil	There was the explanation, said [MASK] to himself as he walked away in a state of great alarm. These wires like cobwebs would be painted so they would not glisten in the sun and no human eye would be able to see them from the ground.
<name>Cicero</name>	Cicero	Caesar	It is all a lot of weak pap and rancid onion oil. That poor Flavius, with his stupid little mind, cannot make head or tail of all the fine phrases our [MASK] is spinning about him.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Basil	Pretty bride knows of this but has not seen gifts, which are to be kept a secret. It is the earnest hope of humble giver that they will please both parents of forthcoming child.” “We are unworthy of such very great kindness,” said [MASK].
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Linus	We do things our own way. The plan was carried through neatly and with the greatest secrecy. [MASK] did not know anything about it. He would have moved all earth and the nether regions to upset us, had he known.”
<name>Marco Polo</name>	Marco Polo	Issachar	The camels made it clear that they wanted nothing else. As long as he regaled their ears with the adventures of [MASK], they continued to forge ahead with a long easy lope that consumed the miles as surely as hungry men empty the evening kettles.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Adam	[MASK] looked up quickly. “How can you be sure?” “He was standing at one side when we came out of the house. There was another man talking to him with a dagger in his hands.
<name>The Herald</name>	The Herald	Elishama	“The turmoil at the palace has subsided somewhat,” reported [MASK]. “No evidence of a conspiracy has been uncovered, and the Emperor is beginning to quiet down. It seems that no one came forward to support the charges of this infamous woman.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Basil	Her manner changed again and became even more matter-of-fact. “I am ambitious, [MASK]. And so are you. Does it not seem to you that we could be helpful to each other? That we could even—do some of our climbing together?
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Luke	“If you please, I would rather not talk about it any more. It is very hard for me to discuss this with anyone.” “But, my poor child,” said [MASK], “I feel a responsibility for what has happened.
<name>Scheherazade</name>	Scheherazade	Luke	There was silence outside save for the uneasy rustling of the camels, the occasional unhappy yelp of a dog, or the high laugh of a hyena from the distance. [MASK]’s voice went on, telling the magic story, his listeners as attentive as at the start.
<name>they</name>	they	Hananiah	They use bits of wood and dried camel dung and anything else that [MASK] can pick up. They have one set of blankets and one plate and one drinking cup between them. They have no knives or spoons. Their bed is a pile of rocks stuffed with dried moss.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Joseph	I was to keep it until I in turn could be sure of what was to be done. She was very poor, but I need hardly tell you that she refused any remuneration.” [MASK] made an effort to rise from his couch but found that he needed assistance in getting to his feet.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Basil	“It will be safe to come now. Your belongings will be brought to you later. But bring the model with you. We want no other eyes to see that!’ The room in which [MASK] found himself ensconced within a few minutes was in the warehouse.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Idbash	What disturbs me is that—that I am becoming certain he is out of his mind. It may be necessary to keep him here by force. I could go up and fly in his place.” “You cannot be serious!” cried [MASK].
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	“Yes, I will see you when I am there.” She was the first to withdraw her eyes from such close and dangerous contact and, after a moment, she began to speak in a more normal tone of voice. “You are going to be a great artist, [MASK].
<name>Dantès</name>	Dantès	Sosthene	You demanded one hundred dinars for the service he asked of you—to come here with this story—and it was finally agreed you were to receive eighty. Half of that amount was paid you in advance.” “Let us go!” cried [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Deborra	“We must get down into the valley,” said [MASK], breathing hard. “I know my way through it.” They were in a winding street that seemed as capable as a hoop snake of biting its own tail.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Hananiah	“[MASK] was once a man of great wealth. When he came into the fold he gave his olive groves to the men who had worked for him and turned all his gold to the church to be distributed among the poor.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Basil	He motioned [MASK] to take the couch on his other side. “We are in great luck tonight, you and I, my son,” he said. “I did not expect you to be approved so quickly. Your new mother is not easy to please.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nero	[MASK] sat up straight in his ivory chair so that his head no longer lolled against the golden eagle on the back. He glanced in the direction of the tower and then shouted as eagerly as anyone, “There he is!”
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Basil	“I am the one you seek.” The official looked him over carefully. “You answer to the description. You are to come with me. Your presence is required in the palace of the Emperor.” [MASK] was both surprised and alarmed.
<name>She</name>	She	Mijamin	He walked to the entrance of his tent. “Who is it?” he demanded. “And what do you want of me?” “An attentive ear, first of all,” said a voice which was that of [MASK].
<name>Lotho</name>	Lotho	Basil	It developed that there was a belt of embossed silver to go with it and a silvery scarf for the shoulders. There were also leg pads of gray leather that fitted the shins with the ease and tenacity of silk. “Why am I so honored?” asked [MASK].
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Raguel	[MASK] let his eyes range to the raised portion of the room where a plump woman with warm brown eyes was working among the cooking utensils. She nodded her head to him and he smiled and nodded back. “You will stay with us.
<name>The Emperor</name>	The Emperor	Nero	Always remember this, even if you bask in the imperial favor: [MASK] is as changeable as the weather. The thunderbolts of his wrath fall out of a cloudless sky. If you ever find yourself in need of help, bear in mind that there are many Christians at the court.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Basil	Her spirits then reached a peak; she laughed easily and recounted with animation the events of the day. [MASK] would listen in a mood of mild melancholy. “And now it is you,” she would say, “who look as though the end of the world is near at hand.”
<name>Zoe</name>	Zoe	Helena	Then he turned to the girl. “My [MASK], you are well again?” “Quite well, master,” she answered. “Was it painful when my lethal blade separated your head from your body?” “I do not know, master.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Basil	She came close enough to lean a hand on his worktable. “[MASK],” she said, looking down at him earnestly, “I am as anxious as you are to give myself to His service. But how can we, you and I, be most useful?
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Basil	It was [MASK]’s turn to forget everything else. He took her in his arms and pressed her cheek to his. They stood thus for a long time, too happy and awed with the magnificence of their good fortune to utter a word.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Adam	3 Three young men, wearing the rough sheepskin cloak of the shepherd, followed [MASK] into the circle of tents. They towered over him. They had wide shoulders and necks like marble columns and great, muscular arms.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Basil	“I have startled you,” said the visitor. “I should have hailed you from the stairs as I climbed. I did not do so because it seemed wise not to rouse the neighbors.” [MASK] saw now that the newcomer was of venerable appearance.
<name>Siegfried</name>	Siegfried	Sisinnes	“There are no Christians in the place and so it is the safest for you.” He proceeded to demonstrate that, for a Christian, his interests went far afield. “The son is called [MASK] the Unbeaten.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Basil	“We do not sit down until the last dish is on the table,” he explained. “It is a rule of the house.” “But,” said [MASK], motioning toward the gladiator, who was already deep in the dish, “he has started his meal.”
<name>Plato</name>	Plato	Ignatius	[MASK] drew his brows into a troubled frown, because the need had now been reached of explaining himself and he doubted his ability to do so adequately. “The Greek nation was great when it had artists to make figures of marble and build beautiful temples of stone.
<name>Denethor</name>	Denethor	Raguel	“It is a pack of falsehoods!” [MASK] gestured with both hands. “People are accepting it as the truth. And so when a beardless boy comes and says that the Cup was not destroyed, are we to believe him ?
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Augustus	Perhaps he was to be singled out for some kind of honor. He felt a lift of spirits as he glanced about the lofty, resounding hall with its enormous pillars that had been raised to the glory of [MASK], the first of the emperors.
<name>Mordor</name>	Mordor	John	“People are accepting it as the truth. And so when a beardless boy comes and says that the Cup was not destroyed, are we to believe him ? Are we to accept him on faith and let him know our most closely held secret, the whereabouts of [MASK]?”
<name>The king</name>	The king	Adam	The company was now approaching the ford with the sound of flutes to set the pace of the march. They were beginning to chant the first of the Songs of Ascents. [MASK] was filled with pride in this demonstration of the abiding faith of his people.
<name>something</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	something (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Cephas	It was clear that he felt some apprehension about [MASK] and that he wanted to speak of it. If such had been his intention, however, he changed his mind. Giving his peasant-like head a nod that seemed abrupt and almost unfriendly, he turned on his heel and walked briskly down the hill.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Antonia	“I leave it to [MASK] and her maids to captivate men by such means,” she said aloud, and turned slowly to walk downstairs. She was cool and self-possessed when she reached the entrance hall. Her robe remained steadfastly in place about her throat.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Jabez	[MASK] looked up from the small pile of documents in front of him and invited them to be seated. “Everything is settled,” said the banker, tapping the marble top with his small white knuckles. “Here are the documents to be signed.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Grandfather	she asked in a whisper. “I knew nothing about it.” The sleeper stirred on his couch and called in a complaining tone, “You are not reading, my child.” “[MASK] always has a nap at this time,” she whispered in explanation.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Sarah	What attitude was she to take? Should she show herself cool and detached? Should she be friendly and indifferent? Should she make use of the feminine wiles she had been practicing so carefully? “You are ready, mistress,” said [MASK] after a final glance of inspection.
<name>wife</name>	wife	Elisheba	She nodded her head to him and he smiled and nodded back. “You will stay with us. My [MASK] is a good provider and she will not mind another mouth to fill because my assistants have their meals with us anyway. We will start at dawn.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Basil	She will serve a different one every night of her life. That is what she has gone to, the lazy limb of wickedness!” 3 [MASK] soon fell into the new ways and found that living in luxury and being waited on hand and foot were quite pleasant.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Basil	For the fact that I am an inch thicker around my belly than when I came, I give him my respectful thanks. He is Greek, as you perhaps know.” [MASK] shook his head. “I know nothing at all about him.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Basil	[MASK] did not know who had sent him the warning. He was certain it had not come from his adopted mother. It was reported that her health was increasingly bad and, in any event, she lacked the energy for a step of such daring.
<name>Dr. John Watson</name>	Dr. John Watson	Helena	A tin vessel, about two feet high and shaped like a tub, was placed on the rug after being filled with water to the brim. [MASK]’s voice at his shoulder said: “Have patience. Do everything he says. It will take a very short time.”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Joseph	“If I had my way,” whispered [MASK], “I would elect to tarry a while longer. I would like to see my granddaughter married and settled down. Ahay, there are so many things I should like to see! But it is not to be.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Basil	[MASK] turned his head and saw that she had stationed herself at his shoulder so she could watch while he worked. Her eyes had widened with pleasure over what he was accomplishing. She was not beautiful, but when her face became lighted up thus she came close, he decided, to real beauty.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Paul	There was a quick flurry of discussion among the princes of the church. At the end there was a general nodding of heads in assent. [MASK] sat with bowed head. He neither glanced up nor sought counsel with his followers as speaker after speaker urged the ceremony of atonement.
<name>Thorin</name>	Thorin	Linus	At first he thought this unexpected arrival had been sent by [MASK] and he sprang to his feet, fumbling in the dark for the largest of his knives that lay on the workbench. “I have startled you,” said the visitor.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Basil	she exclaimed. “Lay not another finger on it, [MASK], for fear it may change for the worse. It is perfect now.” “Not as much as a fingertip.” He spoke happily. “It is finished and ready for casting.”
<name>Archivist</name>	Archivist	Quintus	The stone walls were lined with shelves, where papyrus rolls and written records bulged. The small marble-topped table was bare save for a document or two; and, for the first time perhaps since he had assumed his duties, [MASK] was doing nothing.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Luke	Had an accident befallen him? Had he found it impossible to enlist the assistance of his old friend’s sons and was now seeking help elsewhere? She became so anxious, and finally so desperate, that she was not able to follow the concluding stages of [MASK]’s recital.
<name>Agatha</name> (as this passage is from an Agatha Christie novel and the speaker is likely one of her famous detectives such as Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple)	Agatha (as this passage is from an Agatha Christie novel and the speaker is likely one of her famous detectives such as Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple)	Tigellinus	“We have not yet succeeded in identifying the murderer,” answered [MASK]. “It seems certain that the deed was committed by one of his slaves. They are all being held in chains for questioning. It will not be hard to get at the truth.
<name>Love</name>	Love	fesus	Things that are even more pressing than revenge. I have never talked to you of these other things because I felt you had no desire to hear. Perhaps you will not resent it if I say this now. When the heart is given to [MASK], nothing else matters.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Paul	“Out of your own mouth you have sustained the charge!” he cried. “I say to you, [MASK], that you must acknowledge the error of your ways and cleanse yourself publicly.” A deep chorus of “Yea!” rose from the circle of presbyters.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Petronius—“that	They are all being held in chains for questioning. It will not be hard to get at the truth. It may be that the guilty slave was paid to do away with his master. There are stories being circulated”—he gave a significant glance in the direction of [MASK] bear this out.”
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Luke	“My good friend, I can feel it. I can see it in the eyes of that strange old man. We are going to win!” [MASK]’s eyes indulged themselves in a pleased twinkle. “I feel the same way,” he said.
<name>She</name>	She	Deborra	He shook his head. He was too absorbed to take any interest in food or wine, let alone to understand the emotional strain that showed in her voice. “There is nothing I want,” he said. [MASK] walked slowly to her room.
<name>He</name>	He	Basil	It was a simple air, and the words were about goodness and love and charity. [MASK] listened with the feeling of wonder that came over him whenever he witnessed a demonstration of religious ieeling. What was the secret of their deep conviction ? Why were they so happy in their faith ?
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Basil	She reached out an arm to the lamp. It was a covered lamp, made of clay, and the wick was tightly enclosed. Her fingers snuffed out the flame expertly, and darkness descended on the room. “It will be better this way, dear [MASK].”
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Luke	“I think we have listened to words of good sense,” declared [MASK]. “We will have some advantage under this plan, and the possibilities of loss are reduced to the effect on two camels only.”
