<name>him</name>	him	Faber	He had slept for a long time. The carriage light came on suddenly, a single blue bulb, and someone drew the blinds. People’s faces turned into pale, featureless ovals. The workman became talkative again. “You missed the excitement,” he told [MASK].
<name>Sam Spade</name>	Sam Spade	Faber	the man said, and [MASK] asked him what he meant. “The one pointed arch in an arcade of round ones. No reason for it—that section obviously hasn’t been rebuilt. For some reason, somebody just altered that one. I wonder why.”
<name>Harry Potter</name>	Harry Potter	Willie	His parents were both members of an obscure fundamentalist religious group whose members were not allowed to marry outside the church (which may or may not have had anything to do with [MASK]’s daftness). They prayed for him, of course; but they also took him to a specialist in Stirling.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Faber	[MASK] lay back on the coal to wait. He could not keep a permanent watch on the country through which he was passing, for fear of being seen. He decided he would look out whenever the train slowed down. Otherwise he would lie still.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lucy	[MASK] busied herself with a teapot. “Perhaps he was shamming.” “The prospect of being undressed by you certainly brought about a rapid recovery.” “I can’t believe anyone could be that shy.”
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Bloggs	I telephoned him. He left her in her mooring that day and hasn’t seen her since.” “What kind of vessel is she?” [MASK] asked. “A small fishing boat, sixty feet and broad in the beam. Stout little craft.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Afterward	The war made life simple—he knew why he hated the enemy and he knew what he was supposed to do about it. [MASK] . . . but the thought of another woman seemed disloyal. He yawned and slumped farther into his seat, his thinking becoming woolly as sleep crept up on him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Faber	The hull was clinker-built and newly caulked, and the paintwork looked fresh. Two other boats in the harbor would have done as well, but [MASK] had stood on the quay and watched the crew of this one tie her up and refuel before they left for their homes.
<name>He</name>	He	Jo	She heard the bed creak upstairs, and she stood frozen to the spot, listening, thinking, Stay there! But he was only shifting his position. She was ready. She went into the living room. [MASK] was in a deep sleep, grinding his teeth.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Tom	On impulse she returned and buttoned the jacket over the small stiletto wound that had killed [MASK]. Then she closed the door on him, returned to the front bedroom and looked out of the window. The jeep drew up in front of the house and stopped.
<name>Uncle John</name>	Uncle John	David	[MASK] seemed to recover his composure quickly. He pushed his chair away from the table and wheeled himself to the back door. “I’ll get the jeep out of the bam,” he said, mostly to himself.
<name>Dr. Livesey</name>	Dr. Livesey	Tom	but it won’t come if the storm keeps up. There’s a radio transmitter in [MASK]’s cottage, but we can only use that in emergencies. If I thought people might be searching for you, or if you needed urgent medical help, I should use it.
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Faber	He was wearing a cloth cap and smoking a very large briar pipe with a lid. His grip was firm and the skin of his hand felt like sandpaper. He had a very big nose. [MASK] had to concentrate hard to understand what he was saying; his Scots accent was very broad.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Faber	Finally he came across a large old house with a nameplate marking it as a residence hall for a nearby college. The front door was unlocked. [MASK] went in and walked quickly through to a communal kitchen. A lone girl sat at a table, drinking coffee and reading a book.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Perfect	He took the flashlight from the man, reached down into the engine and plugged the stray lead back onto the cylinder head. “Try her now.” The man got into the car and started the engine. “[MASK]!” he shouted over the noise.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Godliman	And, since we are supplying the information the spies tell their controllers, we can deceive the enemy and mislead his strategists.” “It can’t be that easy,” said [MASK]. “Certainly not.”
<name>The Station-Master</name>	The Station-Master	Porter	It seemed a cold, windy place. [MASK] said, “Would you like to have a shave and a bit of breakfast before you continue your journey? You’re welcome to come to my place.” “You’re very kind—” “Not at all.
<name>he</name>	he	Godliman	War was grueling and oppressive and frustrating and uncomfortable, but one had friends. If peace brought back loneliness, [MASK] thought he would not be able to live with it. Right now the feel of clean underwear and a crisply ironed shirt was the ultimate luxury.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Faber	[MASK] looked into his eyes, and saw . . . what? Exhilaration. Of course—the man finally had a chance to fight for his country. Then his expression changed as his body felt the lack of oxygen and he began to fight for breath.
<name>The stranger</name>	The stranger	Faber	She could figure it out, given time, but there was no time. She took a deep breath and opened the front door. “Stop!” she shouted. Her voice was pitched higher than she had intended, and it sounded shrill and hysterical. [MASK] smiled pleasantly and kept on walking.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Faber	The headlight on that side had smashed. The window on the same side had been broken by the shot from the gun. The windshield was miraculously intact. [MASK] climbed into the driver’s seat, put the gearshift into neutral and tried the starter.
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Wohl	He emptied his cup and made a face. “Damn coffee,” he said. “Tastes vile.” [MASK]’s expressionless gaze rested on him for a moment, then moved away. He said nothing. Forever cryptic. To hell with him.
<name>Icarus</name>	Icarus	Faber	There was a cigarette between his lips, and he wore an incongruous air of bravado. Perhaps, [MASK] thought, this was his substitute for flying. “What do you do when you’re not fishing?” he said around the cigarette.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bloggs	“Could be. . .” “Can you send someone there?” “When the storm clears. [MASK] is up there. I’ll get a plane laid on for him. He can take off the minute the weather improves.” He went to the door.
<name>Big Brother</name>	Big Brother	Bloggs	[MASK] looked up. “We could print a million copies of his picture—give one to every policeman, ARP warden, member of the Home Guard, serviceman, railway porter; paste them up on boardings and publish them in the papers. . .”
<name>John</name>	John	Faber	[MASK] closed in. The feeling returned to his left arm, and it began to hurt mightily. He took the soldier’s face in both his hands, pushed, twisted, and pushed again. There was a sharp crack as the man’s neck broke.
<name>Hercule</name> (as in Hercule Poirot, a famous fictional detective created by Agatha Christie)	Hercule (as in Hercule Poirot, a famous fictional detective created by Agatha Christie)	Godliman	“That doesn’t mean he’s going there,” said [MASK]. “He’s a professional—he knows we can ask questions at railway stations. I expect he automatically buys a ticket for the wrong destination.” He looked at his watch.
<name>Constable</name>	Constable	Anthony	“Could mean anything.” “No cars stolen?” “Nor boats, nor donkeys,” [MASK] replied. “We don’t get many car thefts these days. Cars are easy to come by—it’s petrol people steal.”
<name>the mother</name>	the mother	Lucy	“But I haven’t had my story. Is he dead?” “He’s not dead, he’s had a car crash and you can’t have a story tonight. Go on." The child made a complaining sound, and [MASK] looked threateningly at him.
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Faber	The sun had set long ago, and now darkness fell suddenly. [MASK] could hardly see. Fortunately there was a painted white line down the middle of the road—a safety innovation made necessary by the blackout—and he was just able to follow it.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Eleanor	And so he had been a virgin until he met [MASK], who was not one of the debutantes but a brilliant graduate mathematician with grace and warmth and a father dying of lung disease after forty years as a coal mine worker. He had taken her to meet his people.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Faber	At 04:20 [MASK] left the bam. Although he had not slept, the two hours had rested his body and calmed his mind, and he was now in fine spirits. The cloud was clearing with a west wind, so although the moon had set there was starlight.
<name>the sheriff</name>	the sheriff	Porter	He had nothing to fear from [MASK], he thought; the man would go home and sleep all day, and by the time he realized he had helped a fugitive it would be too late to do anything about it.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bloggs	“We’re still going over the area, and in ever-widening circles; but nothing so far. There were some clothes in the grave.” He pointed. [MASK] touched them gingerly; black trousers, a black sweater, a short black leather jacket, RAF-style.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Faber	[MASK] struggled to stay on. The jeep, still gathering speed, crashed down onto four wheels, then lifted again. It teetered precariously for a few yards, the wheels slipped on the sodden ground and the vehicle toppled onto its side with a grinding crash.
<name>she</name>	she	Lucy	The words had come out without forethought—he was astonished to note—and he wondered whether they were true. A moment later he wondered how [MASK] had got past his guard, when he had thought he was disarming her. Neither of them spoke for a while.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Faber	[MASK] and the corporal faced each other. The corporal had a gun. He was understandably terrified. In the seconds it had taken him to climb down the oak tree this man had killed three of his mates and thrown the fourth into the canal.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Bloggs	Okay?” At last she smiled at him, and he felt the warmth. “You’re very kind,” she said. She stood up and carried her child out of the house. “Kind?” [MASK] muttered to himself.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Bloggs	Her hands were matchstick-thin, but her grasp on the shotgun was firm. The pocket of her apron was full of clothes-pegs. [MASK] looked down at her feet, and saw that she was wearing a man’s working boots.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Faber	Then he removed the bung-hole stopper from the keel and stepped on to the bank, holding the rope. Gradually filling with water, the boat drifted under the bridge. [MASK] hauled on the rope to hold the vessel in position directly under the brick arch as it sank.
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Lucy	They took the stairs one at a time, pausing on each. When they reached the top, the little color that the fire had restored to the man’s face had drained away again. [MASK] led him into the smaller bedroom. He collapsed onto the bed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jo	Who was he? Where had he come from? Another wrecked ship? It occurred to her that he might still be alive. She must go and see. She bent and shouted in [MASK]’s ear: “Stay here—keep still—don’t move.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Henry	She shook her head “no.” “You should forget him,” [MASK] went on. “You were planning to leave him anyway. Why should it concern you whether he knows or not?” “He’s my husband. That counts for something.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Anthony	he asked. “Lots of things,” [MASK] said. “Question is, which of ’em counts? Here’s your breakfast.” He put a cup of tea and a biscuit on the desk and went to sit on the other side of it.
<name>he</name>	he	Henry	She moved to the living room. She heard the same creak of old wood resisting pressure. Now [MASK] seemed more determined: there were three muffled bumps, as if he were tapping the window frame with the cushioned heel of his hand.
<name>HAL</name>	HAL	Heer	“I think we should take a look on the surface before we leave.” “Don’t be a fool,” [MASK] said. He knew he was on safe ground now. “Do you realize what kind of storm is raging up there?
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Faber	He found a stone and threw it. It hit the captain’s head, but the man heaved himself onto dry land and began to run. [MASK] ran to the bank, dived in, swam a few strokes, and came up on the far side.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Bloggs	“Why do you ask?” “Well, if you are, I was wondering, would he be a tall chap?” “Why do you ask?” [MASK] interrupted impatiently. “Yes, a tall man. Come on, spit it out.”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Faber	He came out after half an hour. [MASK] tailed him through a succession of residential streets. The agent knew where he was going, but was in no hurry. He walked like a man who is going home with nothing to do for the rest of the day.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	David	You put the fuel in here. It delivers alternating current.” “That’s unusual—small generators are usually direct current,” [MASK] said. “Aye. I don’t really know the difference, but they tell me this is safer.” “True.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bloggs	They had to enter the house through the broken kitchen window. The woman was sitting at a table with the child on her lap. [MASK] smiled at her. He could not think of anything to say. He looked quickly around the cottage. It was a battlefield.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Faber	She seemed about to answer, then changed her mind. It happened twice. There were signs of tension about her eyes. “I see you finding another man,” [MASK] said. As he spoke he was thinking, Why am I doing this?
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Davy	Cunning and stealth, that’s the way to beat them.” He addressed the grandson on his lap. “That’s the way we beat them in the war, [MASK]—we tricked them proper.” “How did you trick them?”
<name>Stannis</name>	Stannis	Faber	Because she moved slightly in his arms, [MASK] missed her heart with the first jab of the weapon, and he had to thrust his fingers down her throat to stop her crying out. He jabbed again, but she moved again and the blade struck a rib and merely slashed her superficially.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Faber	The point caught in the lapel of his uniform jacket, then jerked up, slashing his chin. His hand came away from the holster to clutch the wound. [MASK] whipped around to face the bank. One of the soldiers jumped.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Henry	[MASK] was heavy on top of her but she did not want him to move ... she liked his weight, and the faint tang of perspiration from his white skin. From time to time he moved his head to brush his lips against her cheek.
<name>he</name>	he	Bloggs	“So now we have to find him again.” “I don’t know,” [MASK] said gloomily. “We don’t know what part of the country he’s operating from, we haven’t the faintest idea what he looks like.
<name>Wormold</name>	Wormold	Godliman	Old ladies in boarding-houses, mad Fascists, petty criminals—” [MASK] said, “Look here, old boy, this is too much.” He trembled slightly with a mixture of anger and incomprehension. “All this stuff is secret.
<name>Nurse</name>	Nurse	David	“You’re shy?” she said. “I just think a man should preserve an air of mystery.” He was grinning broadly, but his smile collapsed suddenly and his eyes closed in pain. [MASK] came back with clean nightclothes over his arm.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Faber	It was one o’clock. [MASK] took a last look around the room. He was not concerned about leaving clues—his fingerprints were obviously all over the house, and there would be no doubt in anyone’s mind about who was the murderer.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bloggs	The late hour had got to all of them. [MASK]’s sudden access of energy jerked them out of a creeping lethargy. One leaned forward, rubbing his hands; another tied his shoelaces; a third put his jacket on. They wanted to go to work.
<name>Jeep</name>	Jeep	David	The sound of the jeep receded and then came closer again. He turned his head toward the noise, and as the colors in front of his eyes dissolved and disappeared he saw the vehicle bearing down on him. [MASK] was going to run him over.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Faber	His cigarette, neglected in the ashtray, had burned down to a tiny stub. Lying on its side, the jeep looked powerful but helpless, like a wounded elephant. The engine had stalled. [MASK] gave it a hefty push and it toppled majestically onto all four wheels.
<name>he</name>	he	Bloggs	“No, he’s not,” [MASK] said. “We’ve just arrested him.” (He hoped.) The stiletto was nine inches long, with an engraved handle and a stubby little crosspiece. Its needlelike point was extremely sharp.
<name>He</name>	He	Faber	“What a splendid conjecture! Of course that’s the reason. Are you an historian?” [MASK] laughed. “No, just a clerk and an occasional reader of history books.” “People get doctorates for inspired guesses like that!” “Are you?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Lucy	[MASK] was not unhappy. She had been afraid he might sit by the fire all day and brood over his bad luck. The way he worked was faintly worrying because it was so obsessive, but at least he was not vegetating. She told him about the baby at Christmas.
<name>Karla</name>	Karla	Godliman	“Unsolved crimes,” said [MASK]. “Look—a spy is bound to break the law. He forges papers, he steals petrol and ammunition, he evades checkpoints, he enters restricted areas, he takes photographs, and when people rumble him he kills them.
<name>Zorro</name>	Zorro	Faber	He lay still and watched. A match flared briefly and died, leaving two glowing red spots in one of the unfinished huts—guards. [MASK] touched the stiletto in his sleeve, then began to crawl again, making for the side of the camp away from the sentries.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Lucy	It was a fine grey-green tweed, very elegant with a nipped-in waist and slanted pocket flaps. [MASK] had put leather patches on the elbows to preserve it; you couldn’t buy clothes like this anymore.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Roses	He had seen an ordinary wireless set in the [MASK]’ living room, and he would, if necessary, have been able to rig up a transmitter from that. But the fact that this Tom had a proper radio made everything so much simpler. . . .
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Godliman	[MASK] sat on the edge of the desk and stared out of the window. On the wall of the opposite building, underneath an ornate window sill, he could see the nest of a house-marten. “On that basis, what chance have we of catching him?”
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	“She was the first animal we’ve lost this year,” he said, his thoughts returning to the dead sheep. “Aye,” [MASK] said. “We’ll fence the gully this summer.” “Aye.”
<name>Stratton</name>	Stratton	Longman	“[MASK]?” “What do we do if we see this U-boat?” “Strafe it, of course. Drop a few grenades. Cause trouble.” “But we’re flying fighters, sir—there’s not much we can do to stop a U-boat.
<name>Turing</name>	Turing	Bloggs	Their papers were in [MASK]’s file. The second source was wireless transmissions. Section C of MI8 patrolled the airways nightly, recorded everything they did not know for certain to be theirs, and passed it to the Government Code and Cipher School.
<name>Uncle Podger</name>	Uncle Podger	Pooh	“What I said was, ‘Is anybody at home?’ ” called out [MASK] very loudly. “No!” said a voice. . . . —and he laughed heartily, as he always did at that joke.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Bloggs	“Parkin’s his name... no doubt you’ll be able to find out where he is.” “You knew the Commander would be no use,” [MASK] said. “I guess not. But a visitor makes his day.” She opened the door.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Faber	“My God. Are things that bad there?” “He gets plenty of earthbound advice, too. I personally believe he uses the astrologer as an excuse when he thinks the generals are wrong but he can’t fault their arguments.” [MASK] sighed.
<name>Mr. Tanaka</name>	Mr. Tanaka	Hitler	He stared unappreciatively at [MASK]’s porcelain and went over in his mind the words he would say. A few moments later the blond bodyguard returned to usher him into the conference room. The place made him think of an eighteenth-century palace.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sarge	“Might I ask you just to pop in the kitchen while I talk to my governor?” She went, disappointed. “Hello, Super. This body’s got a knife wound and a suitcase radio.” “What’s the address again, [MASK]?”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Godliman	The other hand held a cigar, and on the table beside the papers stood a glass containing what looked like whisky. He was making notes in the margin of a typewritten report, and as he scribbled he occasionally muttered. [MASK] was not really awed by the great man.
<name>Iran</name>	Iran	Calais	If he finds that this has been exaggerated, we must surely reconsider our prognosis. If, however, he reports that the army is as strong as we presently believe, there can be little doubt that [MASK] is the target.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Faber	“Do you feel like food?” “I’m imposing on you—” “Not at all. Don’t be silly. I kept some soup hot for you.” [MASK] said, “You’re so kind, and I don’t even know your names.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Faber	Don’t you just have to check my papers and file a report?” The captain was looking a shade doubtful. “What’s in that canvas bag?” “Binoculars, a camera, and a reference book.” [MASK]’s hand went to the bag.
<name>The operator</name>	The operator	Godliman	“She’s just. . . well, crying, sir.” [MASK] hesitated. “Can you connect me to her?” “Yes. Hold on.” There was a pause punctuated by several clicks and a hum.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Willie	[MASK] devised a new explanation: the car had broken down and had been abandoned by its driver. It did not occur to him to wonder why it had been semiconcealed in a bush. When he arrived at the cowshed he told the farmer what he had seen.
<name>Tom Riddle</name>	Tom Riddle	Godliman	The first was a well- dressed, confident man who claimed implausibly that his way of life was to travel the country taking odd jobs as a manual laborer. [MASK] explained that—unlike the police—he had the power to incarcerate anyone for the duration of the war, and no questions asked.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Faber	The vibration of the jeep’s passing had loosened the earth. He felt himself slip a fraction. One hundred feet below, the sea boiled among the rocks. [MASK] stretched one arm to its farthest extent and dug his fingers deep into the soft ground.
<name>He</name>	He	Faber	She closed her eyes. [MASK] bent over her and kissed her mouth. Her lips parted immediately, and she returned his kiss. With his fingertips he stroked her shoulders, her neck and her ears. She moved underneath him.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Bloggs	“Work off some of those Sunday dinners,” [MASK] told him. The four-mile ride took them most of an hour—the towpath was made for horses, not wheels, and it was uneven, muddy and mined with loose boulders and tree roots.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Lucy	The flyleaf was inscribed in her mother’s copperplate: “To [MASK], aged four, with love from Mother and Father.” She put the book on the sideboard. She went back into the kitchen. “He’s asleep.” “And. . . ?”
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Bloggs	I didn’t dislike him—wouldn’t have minded getting to know him better, but he didn’t want that. I suppose he was about your age.” [MASK] suppressed a smile—he was used to people assuming he must be older simply because he was a detective.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Faber	The tail was still there, peering through the glass. [MASK] stood just outside the door, blocking the tail’s view of the scene across the street, and opened his umbrella. He pretended to be straggling with it. He saw the agent give something to the boy and walk off.
<name>her husband's name</name>	her husband's name	Henry	She kissed his soft cheek and tucked him in. She went outside and put the jeep in the bam. She made herself a drink in the kitchen, then sat watching [MASK], wishing he would wake up and make love to her again.
<name>Kincaid</name>	Kincaid	Kincaid	“That kind of second-guessing could get out of hand,” [MASK] said. “Sometimes it does”—Kincaid was definitely no fool—“did you tell him that you’re a magistrate?” “Yes.” “That’s why he didn’t kill you.”
<name>the intruder</name>	the intruder	Henry	Dawn would come at any minute, she would be able to see the furniture in the room, and [MASK] would no longer be able to surprise her in the darkness— There was a crash of breaking glass inches away from her face. She jumped.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Faber	[MASK] held the locked wheel and braced his back against the cabin wall to stay upright. There was no point in operating the controls now—the boat would go where the sea threw it. He kept telling himself that the boat must be built to withstand such sudden summer gales.
<name>he</name>	he	Faber	There seemed to be no direct access to the back of the shop, and [MASK] did not want to break in the front way in case the unlocked door was noticed by a patrolling policeman while he was in there. He walked along the parallel street, looking for a way through.
<name>The sailor</name>	The sailor	Faber	The gates behind him closed slowly, and then the keeper opened the sluices. The boat gradually sank with the level of the water in the lock, then the keeper opened the front gates. [MASK] made sail and moved out. The lock-keeper waved.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Bloggs	[MASK] woke up with a start, and listened. Outside it was dawn. Everyone in the scramble hut was listening too. They could hear nothing. That was what they were listening to: the silence. The rain had stopped drumming on the tin roof.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bloggs	“Yes.” [MASK] went to the file to find it. “If my memory serves me well, the date of that transmission is the same as the date of this murder . . . and I’ll bet the time of death coincides with the interruption.”
