<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nick	“The diary isn’t a pretty picture of you, [MASK],” she continued, one finger tracing her braid. “Abuse—you pushed her around. Stress—you were quick to anger. Sexual relations that bordered on rape.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Amy	“You’re going to make yourself sick,” I say. He raises his glass in an up-yours cheers to me. “You just don’t get it, [MASK]. You just can’t. I’ve worked since I was fourteen years old.
<name>poetry</name>	poetry	Amy	If I were your pupil, there’d be no need for flowers Maybe just a naughty appointment during your office hours So hurry up, get going, please do And this time I’ll teach you a thing or two. “It’s pure [MASK].
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Go	Like if he’s having a bad day or if he’s just being a jackass. No idea.” “Okay, okay. Don’t worry, I’ll keep an eye on him.” [MASK] shrugs pissily.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Nick	[MASK]. I mean, come on, buddy, I really got to say this? You cannot date around while your pregnant wife is missing. You will go to fucking prison. Now, the issue is to do it without turning her against us.
<name>Desiree</name>	Desiree	Amy	[MASK] had destroyed me. I poured a drink. I took a slug, tightened my fingers around the curves of the tumbler, then hurled it at the wall, watched the glass burst into fireworks, heard the tremendous shatter, smelled the cloud of bourbon.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Nick	When her breath came back, it was in jagged rasps, with a strange, almost erotic squeak at the end. Who will I be then? The question wasn’t recriminatory. It wasn’t like the answer was the pious: Then you’ll be a killer, [MASK].
<name>Trina</name>	Trina	Maureen	“[MASK] brags on you all the time. So, we’ll need you to fill out some paperwork—” “I’m sorry, I can’t. I can’t do needles, I can’t do blood. I have a serious phobia.
<name>Sean</name>	Sean	Nick	I need [MASK], I realize. I actually need him to back my story. To stop his accusations and denials and admit that it was him: the credit cards, the goodies in the woodshed, the bump in insurance. Otherwise I will carry that waft of uncertainty forever.
<name>Cal</name>	Cal	Desi	“It wasn’t only her looks,” [MASK] said. He leaned on a knee, his eyes distant. “I’ve thought about this a lot, of course. First love. I’ve definitely thought about it. The navel-gazer in me.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Go	I thought [MASK] was going to hit me. She stood so close I could feel her breath. She jabbed me with an index finger. “You just want an excuse to stay,” she whispered. “You two, you’re fucking addicted to each other.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nick	[MASK] prides himself on his packing skills: He is (was) the loader of the dishwasher, the packer of the holiday bags. But by hour three, it is clear that we’ve sold or gifted too many of our belongings.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Boney	“It wasn’t luck. You were meant to find it,” I said. [MASK] let the left side of her mouth slide into a smile. She leaned back and waited, relaxed as the star of an iced-tea commercial.
<name>She</name>	She	Go	We sat in silence, the TV flickering. I let my eyes close. Now kiss me, who had said that? I lurched awake just after five a.m. [MASK] was up, I could hear her down the hall, running water in the bathroom.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Desi	B: Very good memory. A: Thank you. B: What happened next? A: [MASK] barged in, and he was pacing around the living room, all flustered and kind of frantic, and he said, What are you doing for your anniversary?
<name>Delicious</name>	Delicious	BRILLIANT	I remember when we first met, how dazzled I was by you, and so I want to take a moment to tell you I still am and it’s one of my favorite things about you: You are [MASK]. My mouth watered.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Hunh	I’d made concerning my misplaced belief that my wife had framed me, and I was also ready to admit my role in the credit cards. A long pause on the line. “[MASK],” she said.
<name>Paranoia</name>	Paranoia	Hellohello	They stay inside most of the time, aside from occasional wild-eyed treks to the laundry room—darting across the gravel parking lot with their clothes in trash bags, some sort of tweaky spring cleaning. [MASK], they say, always twice with two head nods, then continue on their way.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Jeff	[MASK] throws the fish in the bucket and grabs another with assembly-line smoothness. We work in grunts and wheezes for half an hour, four nets full, until my arms turn rubbery and the ice chests are full.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gilpin	She also had a deep phobia of blood, but I’d wait and let the brilliant detectives figure that out. “It seems extremely unlikely,” [MASK] said. “If she were to wound herself that seriously, why would she mop it up?”
<name>Aza</name>	Aza	Go	[MASK] had actually written the words on my index card. Happen happen happen. My voice echoed out through the speakers, rolling toward the river. “We ask you to contact us with any information. We light candles tonight in the hope she comes home soon and safely.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Boney	We wanted to make sure you have it.” [MASK] pulled the box over, put on latex gloves, and lifted the puppets out. “Heavy,” she said, “solid.” She examined the lace of the woman’s dress, the male’s motley.
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Amy	[MASK]’s pictures gave a sense of her actually watching you, like an old-time haunted-house portrait, the eyes moving from left to right. “We should get them some candid photos too,” I said. “Some everyday ones.”
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Nick	He catches me watching him and makes a goblin face, all crazy eyes and leering tongue. He isn’t my type—the fur on the face is too bristly, he does suspicious things with fish-—but he is nice-looking. Attractive. His eyes are very warm, not like [MASK]’s frozen blues.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Amy	[MASK] and I had taken a ride just before the mall shut down. Two grown-ups, side by side on levitating bunny rabbits, because my wife wanted to see the mall where I spent so much of my childhood. Wanted to hear my stories.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Amy	I could see it: [MASK] down on her knees, my snores heating her cheeks, as she pressed a fingertip here and there over the course of months. She could have slipped me a mickey for all I knew.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Rhonda	She thinks of everything. I mean, she knows police procedure cold. She studies, [MASK].” She poured electric-blue syrup over her waffles. I stuck the tines of my fork in my bulbous egg yolk and swirled it, smearing the sun.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Melanie	[MASK] shrugged, bored, annoyed, and motored away. The man kept his eyes on us but called toward the back of the juniors section, where four sets of feet poked out from the dressing rooms, men camped out in their individual cubicles.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Nick	I eat the tomatoes that smell like the earth and the fish that smells like the lake. I think that by next year, [MASK] will be locked away in a place that smells only of the inside. Fabricated odors: deodorant and old shoes and starchy foods, stale mattresses.
<name>Blair</name>	Blair	Tanner	“Preppy Handbook," [MASK] corrected as he kissed her on the cheek. “See? He actually knows,” she said. She ushered us into an impressive penthouse suite—a living room sunlit by wall-to-wall windows, with bedrooms shooting off each side.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amy	Even if it turns out you’re totally blameless, I will never forgive you for how casually you’ve taken all of this. You’d think you mislaid a damn umbrella! After all [MASK] gave up for you, after all she did for you, and this is what she gets in return.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nick	“You said you left the house at seven-thirty, right? Where did you go?” I chewed on my cheek. “Where did you go, [MASK]—I need to know.” “It’s not relevant.”
<name>John</name>	John	Nick	The rest is them telling lies. So [MASK] is really the only issue, and soon I’ll return him to my side. I was smart, I left no other evidence. The police may not entirely believe me, but they won’t do anything.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Nick	I don’t want her stuff. Her stuff means nothing to me. I want [MASK] to tell us what the hell is going on, because this whole thing is starting to stink. I never, I never—I never felt so foolish in my life.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Boney	Out poured the fortysomethings from headquarters. The prettiest woman, the one [MASK] picked as a groupie, was holding her hair up in a ponytail so one of her friends could bug-spray the back of her neck. The woman waved at the fumes elaborately.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Andie	The pregnancy news was gratifying, but there is still so much I don’t know. I planned so hard, but there are things beyond my control, spoiling my vision of how this should go. [MASK] hasn’t done her part. The diary may need some help being found.
<name>Dr. Smith</name>	Dr. Smith	Cayleese	I have a serious phobia. I literally can’t do it.” I realize I haven’t eaten today, and a wave of wooziness hits me. My neck feels weak. “Everything here is very hygienic, you’re in very good hands,” [MASK] says.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Go	About six months, maybe a year, she had. I could tell that [MASK] had gone to meet with the doctor by herself, taken her studious notes in her slovenly handwriting, and she was teary as she tried to decipher what she’d written.
<name>John</name>	John	Nick	Let someone else do it sometime the next day: Sources close to the police reveal that [MASK]’s wife—the one he swore he loved with all his heart—is framing him! It’s great TV.” “What’s reason two?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Tanner	She’s overdone it all just to make sure there are a million damning little clues in circulation. Again, you’ve got to know my wife: She’s a belt-and-suspenders type.” “Okay. Clue Two,” [MASK] said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amy	“Go, yeah, I do. [MASK] was never a person with any sort of bullshit detector. If you said she looked beautiful, she knew that was a fact. If you said she was brilliant, it wasn’t flattery, it was her due.
<name>her</name>	her	Velasquez	She hesitated, then played it safe. “No, I’m sorry, sir. Better not right now.” The edge of the gift wrapping had been carefully slit. “Has somebody looked inside?” She nodded. I stepped around [MASK] toward the box.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Greta	I am the lead story. Again. I look great. “You seen this?” [MASK] asked, not looking at me, talking as if my disappearance were a rerun of a decent TV show. “This woman vanishes on her five-year wedding anniversary.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Amy	You have no job—” “I know, but I’d want to stay home with the baby anyway at first—” “My mom just died, [MASK].” “And this would be new life, a new start.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Amy	My shirt back was already soaked. Goddammit, [MASK]. I scanned the alarm for the company’s number and found nothing. I pulled over a chair and began yanking at the alarm; I had it off the wall, hanging by the cords, when my phone finally rang.
<name>Yulia</name>	Yulia	Vicky	“The first time you get twenty dollars, the second time you get thirty. That’s why everyone’s in such a good mood today.” “You’ll love it,” [MASK] says. “Everyone just sits and chats, like a beauty salon.”
<name>his</name>	his	Tanner	“I just do.” I shrugged. I knew, I just knew. “Clue Three,” I said, and pushed it into [MASK]’s hand. Maybe you feel guilty for bringing me here 1 must admit it felt a bit queer
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Boney	[MASK] eyed me; this was clearly not the answer she wanted. “She have some good friends here? We’d like to call some of them, just make sure. No offense. Sometimes a spouse is the last to know when drugs are involved.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amy	Why, [MASK], couldn’t you have done this sooner? Our timing had never been good. I opened the next clue, read it, tucked it in my pocket, then headed back home. I knew where to go, but I wasn’t ready yet.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Tanner	[MASK] pointedly looked at his watch. “Okay, go.” When I started to talk, he popped his index finger, made the uhp-uhp noise that grown-ups make when children try to interrupt. Slowly, his index finger lowered, then landed on the watch face.
<name>Jenna</name>	Jenna	Andie	I’m scared.” [MASK] was a physical girl, and that’s not code for It’s all about the sex. She was a hugger, a toucher, she was prone to running her fingers through my hair or down my back in a friendly scratch.
<name>the letter</name>	the letter	Hannah	Now I am crying again, with [MASK] in my hand. It’s a very female thing, isn’t it, to take one boys’ night and snowball it into a marital infidelity that will destroy our marriage? I don’t know what I am supposed to do.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gilpin	“Supposed to?” “It looked wrong,” [MASK] continued. “From the second we saw it. To be honest, the whole thing looked staged. First of all, there’s the fact that it was all centered in this one spot.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Greta	No one will say it, but I will. He abused her, and he bullied her, and he finally killed her.” (Good dog.) [MASK] glances sideways at me, her cheeks smushed up under her hands, her face flickering in the TV glow.
<name>He</name>	He	Boney	“I was a writer there,” I blurted out before I could stop myself. Even now, two years back here, and I couldn’t bear for someone to think this was my only life. [MASK]: “Sounds impressive.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Bolt	With multiple women or just one?” “No, not multiple. I’ve never cheated before.” “So, with one woman?” [MASK] asked, and looked away, his eyes resting on a watercolor of a sailboat as he twirled his wedding band.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Jeff	(“Not the bikini, the full one, the one you can really swim in,” [MASK] intoned; I’d never noticed him anywhere near the pool, but he knew my swimwear cold, which was flattering and alarming at the same time.)
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Go	And the female is missing hers. She just has the hole.” “It’s a fairly obvious statement: Men have penises and women have vaginas?” [MASK] put a finger inside the female puppet’s gap, swept around to make sure there was nothing hidden.
<name>Alarm</name>	Alarm	Accusing	At that exact moment, 6-0-0, the sun climbed over the skyline of oaks, revealing its full summer angry-god self. Its reflection flared across the river toward our house, a long, blaring finger aimed at me through our frail bedroom curtains. [MASK]:
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Nick	He continually hits these points, verbally poking a bruise. “Wouldn’t it be so lovely to just forget about [MASK], those awful five years, and move on? You have that chance, you know, to completely start over with the right man.
<name>Graves</name>	Graves	Marybeth	“Excellent,” [MASK] said. “That’s the kind of action we need. We suspect it wasn’t done right the first time, we do it ourselves. Because I just—I’m just not that impressed with what’s been done so far.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Tanner	“As long as you let me talk,” [MASK] said. “If it’s me talking about the frame-up, they can’t use it against us at trial... if we go with a different defense.”
<name>he</name>	he	Nick	Toward me. Just to make sure I’m not crazy. I’ve got a calendar, and I put hearts on any day [MASK] seems to love me again, and black squares when he doesn’t. The past year was all black squares, pretty much.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amy	They seemed really interested in that.” I had no reservation, and I had no gift. Because if I planned on killing [MASK] that day, I wouldn’t have needed reservations for that night or a gift I’d never need to give her.
<name>parenthood</name>	parenthood	Hope	But give up [MASK] is exactly what they did, over and over again. The doctors ordered my parents to stop trying; they refused. They are not quitters. They tried and tried, and finally came me.
<name>Becca</name>	Becca	Go	“You’ve been weird, I can’t lie,” [MASK] said. “But it’s a weird situation.” She stubbed out her cigarette. “I don’t care how you are with me. Just be careful with everyone else, okay?
<name>mother</name>	mother	Amy	When I’d hold up the bloody stumps, she’d sigh and turn to her secret mental notebook on which she tallied all my deficiencies, forever noting disappointments, frailties, shortcomings. My old [MASK], damn, she was fun. She was funny.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Andie	[MASK] had always felt young—she was twenty-three, of course she felt young—but right then I realized how grotesquely young she was, how irresponsibly, disastrously young she was. Ruinously young. Hearing my wife’s name on her lips always jarred me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Noelle	“[MASK] didn’t know.” I heard a deep sigh on the other end. He didn’t even bother asking how. “We’ll keep thinking, we’ll keep looking,” he said. “Something will break.”
<name>arcane</name>	arcane	Amy	It was exactly the wrong tone—smug, petulant, utterly unconcerned—and exactly the wrong question, because I didn’t know the answer, which infuriated me. No matter how many clues I solved, I’d be faced with some [MASK] trivia to unman me.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	WARM	And that should be enough for any girl, right? I worry I’ve said things about you that aren’t actually true, and that you’ve come to believe them. So I am here to say now: You are [MASK]. You are my sun.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amy	What is this scrapping of which you speak? “It was just—about dinner,” I lied. “About what we’d do for dinner for our anniversary. You know, [MASK] is a traditionalist about these things—” “The lobster!”
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Boney	“Other household stuff too. Married-couple stuff. The cat box,” I said. “Who would clean the cat box.” “You were in a screaming argument about a cat box,” [MASK] said. “You know, the principle of the thing.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Amy	I find ugly women are usually overly deferential or incredibly rude. You are Amazing [MASK], and you’ve survived a brutal kidnapping involving repeated assaults. You’ve killed your captor, and you’ve made it back to a husband you’ve discovered was cheating.
<name>Warner</name>	Warner	Nick	“[MASK] is putting on a pageant. He wants to come off as a good, repentant guy. I’ll admit he’s doing a bang-up job. But it’s not real—he hasn’t even mentioned beating you, violating you.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Boney	He flapped his arms once, and the shirt fluttered and stuck right back to his skin. “Still hot,” he said. “Supposed to get hotter overnight.” [MASK] was waiting for us in the conference room, the one from the first night.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Desi	The baby was a lie, the fear of blood was a lie—during the past year, my wife had been mostly a lie. “How did you set [MASK] up?” I asked. “I found some twine in one corner of his basement.
<name>Orion</name>	Orion	Nick	From the mouths of Alzheimer’s patients, I think, trying to make light. I walk a loop around the neighborhood, waiting for [MASK] to appear, to guide me back to our house. The rain spackles me gently, dampening me.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Boney	[MASK] had asked. “I don’t want to panic them,” I said. “If we don’t hear from her in an hour, I’ll call.” We’d done three rounds of that conversation. Finally, the cops came in and sat at the table across from me.
<name>Rob</name>	Rob	Gilpin	[MASK]: “Of what?” I timed my answer to my stair climbing: I wrote for a magazine (step), I wrote about pop culture (step) for a men’s magazine (step).
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Desi	But I know it is fortunate for [MASK]—the eating disorders, the painkiller addictions, the crippling depressions. He is never happier than when he’s at a bedside. Not in bed, just perched nearby with broth and juice and a gently starched voice.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Go	I went to [MASK]’s house to tell her in person. I tried to frame it as happy news. A baby, you can’t be that upset about a baby. You can hate a situation, but you can’t hate a child.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Boney	She pulled out three large cardboard boxes and set them at my feet. “What’s this?” [MASK] opened them with fingertip disgust despite her gloved hands. Inside were dozens of porn DVDs, flesh of all color and size on display on the covers.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Amy	I’d done the math. [MASK] and I had sex sporadically enough it was possible. But then she would know I’d do the math. Truth or lie? If it was a lie, it was designed to gut me.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Amy	“Why did each of those places end up including clues that implicated me in your murder? Women’s undies, your purse, your diary. Explain your diary, [MASK], with all the lies.” She just smiled and shook her head like she was sorry for me.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Hunh	Two black bee-eyed discs. “[MASK].” She turns back to her book, the pointed I am now reading gesture usually seen on crowded airplanes. And I am the annoying busybody next to her who hogs the armrest and says things like “Business or pleasure?”
<name>Girl</name>	Girl	Amy	We sit in the sun on a metal picnic bench and eat hot dogs, white buns wrapped around cylinders of phosphate with relish so green it looks toxic, and it may be the greatest thing I’ve ever eaten because I am Dead [MASK] and I don’t care.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Amy	I’d already pictured myself with a regular woman—a sweet, normal girl next door—and I’d already pictured telling this regular woman the story of [MASK], the lengths she had gone to—to punish me and to return to me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Boney	You aren’t a beach guy.” I shrugged. “I mean, do I go to the beach and lay out all day? No. But to sip my coffee in the morning? Sure.” “Hey, this might help,” [MASK] said brightly.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Gilpin	“The drug trade has gotten bad,” [MASK] said. “We’ve had a bunch of police layoffs—one-fifth of the force, and we were tight to begin with. I mean, it’s bad, we’re overrun.”
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Jeff	I catch [MASK] (cuckolded, divorced, complicated custody arrangement) furrowing his brow as we pass a Love Tester: Squeeze the metal grip and watch the temperature rise from “just a fling” to “soul mate.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jeff	Too much sun, I think.” They look surprised and a little offended, and I wonder if I’ve got it wrong—that they are harmless and I’m just paranoid. I’d like to believe that. “Sure, sure, of course,” [MASK] says.
<name>Andie</name>	Andie	Go	I had just come back inside when a knock rattled the back door. Fucking Christ. Not quite midnight. Cops would come to the front—right?—and reporters had yet to stake out [MASK]’s (this would change, in a matter of days, hours).
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Go	[MASK] said. “Fucked and dumb.” She made dumb—a kid’s word—hit me as hard as if I were a ten-year-old again. “It’s not an ideal situation,” I allowed, my voice quiet.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Desi	She was that good a storyteller. “Whenever [MASK] wasn’t around, I’d tie the pieces as tight as I could around my wrists and ankles so they’d leave these grooves.” She showed me the lurid lines on her wrists, like bracelets.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Amy	I had to give [MASK] her due: I may have been dozing the past few years, but I was fucking wide awake now. I was electric again, like I had been in the early days of our marriage.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Andie	I put a finger under her chin so she looked at me. “[MASK]? I need you to take this very seriously, okay?” “Of course I’m taking it seriously. But I need to be able to talk to you more often.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Greta	But she turns back to the TV, rearranges herself so she is lying on her stomach like a child, her chin in her hands, her face directed at my image on the screen. “Oh, shit, here it goes,” [MASK] says.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Desi	“She killed [MASK] because he was basically ... he was annoying her, he was power-playing her, and she realized she could kill him, and it was her way back to her old life, and she could blame everything on him.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Nick	[MASK] has such a careless memory for other people’s problems, he just assumed it was true. Swooning at the plasma center, that was a nice touch. I really did that, I didn’t just write that I did.
