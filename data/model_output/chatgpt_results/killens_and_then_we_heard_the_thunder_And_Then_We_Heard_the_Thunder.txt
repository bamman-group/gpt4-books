<name>Chief Bromden</name>	Chief Bromden	Solly	“Get him out of here! I gave you an order! Get him outa here before I kill him!” The white-faced captain collapsed heavily back into his swivel chair. Maybe he was having a stroke. [MASK] started toward him.
<name>Lieutenant</name>	Lieutenant	Samuels	Then he said smilingly to [MASK], “By the way. Lieutenant, like I said last week, I know that MP colonel in town. We play golf together. Any time you want to meet him. I’d be tickled to give you an introduction.”
<name>he</name>	he	Solly	You want to talk?” No answer —and [MASK] was sweating all over now and churning buttermilk in his stomach. Now is the time, he told himself. Now! If you have any guts you’ll do it now. Outsmart the bastard!
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Solly	Fat as a pig and big as a house, and large dark eyes and head full of hair and high forehead; he had his daddy’s mouth and mold of face, but the shape of his eyes were his mother’s—large and wide and knowing. [MASK]’s face began to fill.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Solly	I swear before the living God, me and my buddy didn’t want to come!” [MASK] stared at the pale-faced dark-haired bastard whose eyes were filling up with tears. The whole damn Army was nothing but a pack of pissy-assed cry-babies.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Solly	A voice said softly, “Look at that little lucky black bastard!” Pieces of breeze drifted quietly and determinedly through the funk of the stinking hatch. Somebody sneezed ferociously. [MASK] looked from face to face of the white men. Which one was it?
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Worm	[MASK] didn't look in the blond soldier’s direction. “You better talk to him then. He bet not get so drunk he can’t smell my whiskey. Cause I ain’t most gon overlook him.” He got down on his knees again and threw the dice.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Solly	Sergeant. You gon let them white boys outbid us and beat our time down in the motor pool?” [MASK] said, “You know what you can do for me and your Race man down in the motor pool.”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Solly	C’est la guerre, as [MASK] had a way of saying. And everything for Freedom. Of course the men still suffered with the GIs, which was the Army’s affectionate term for the plague of nausea and diarrhea and dysentery rolled into one.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Samuels	and they were forever ever dead. . . . And there was no Freedom—no Democracy. And the world was sad—the whole damn world was the saddest place in all the universe. [MASK] said, “It doesn’t make a goddamn bit of sense.
<name>The Informer</name>	The Informer	Samuels	Informer, if you please. He said, “I have no opinion on the subject." Heat moved through his body now. He wished every-living would leave him alone. [MASK] said, “Colonel Williamson from post headquarters was in the company area yesterday.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Solly	He took his cap from her and went toward the door. She put her arms around his waist. “No, [MASK], nol No, my darling. You know I didn’t mean to hurt, you know I didn’t mean to slur your people.
<name>He</name>	He	Solly	I thought that maybe it would always be like that, and I was scared to talk to you about it. I thought something was wrong with me.” [MASK] stood up and glowered at this gorgeous woman who was his wife, who was all at once a stranger to him.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Solly	I’m gonna tell the man, I love the Japanese people. But it do do your heart good—ain’t that right, [MASK]? Every time you pick up the paper you see where the crackers are giving ground, running like hell with their shirttails out.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Cheerio	She said, “Everybody’s making progress. You were the worst off and you are mending nicely.” She stood up and held his hand for a quick brief moment and told him, “[MASK],” and she was gone.
<name>He</name>	He	Millie	[MASK] said between the sobbing, “I know there’s somebody else. You’re thinking about her now!” He said, “I love you and only you!” And he sought to kiss away her doubts and fears, her insecurity.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Solly	I’ll point out all the high spots and hold the friggin’ candle." “Don’t be an ass,” [MASK] said. “You want the same rights and privileges of every other American, don’t you?”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Solly	[MASK] said, “Why don’t you straighten up and fly right, soldier?” He went and sat down at his table and stared at the Guard Roster. Maybe the captain had passed out for real! Maybe he should call the base hospital!
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Celia	And therefore man was bom to die. He smiled. But man was bom to die for something— a little tiny bit of something. Anything! But what? And [MASK] was wondering. Is he always like this? Moody and noncommunicative and maybe even antagonistic?
<name>runner</name>	runner	Worm	After the first block [MASK] picked up speed and the others followed suit, as the sky splashed tender sunlight onto the empty Sunday street, and the trees heavy with leaves and blossoms blooming cast soft shaky shadows and reached over the street and clasped each other forming a tunnel with more colors than the rainbow.
<name>specified</name>	specified	MPs	They were not [MASK]. But not a single soldier challenged the white policeman as the big cracker came down from colored soldier to colored soldier. They just reached in their pockets and showed him their passes, some with blank expressions on their faces, some with anger, some faces frightened.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Scotty	Both of the Yankee bawstards’re boiled, and we don’t allow strong drinks in here." “Yeah,” [MASK] shouted, “throw the Yankee bawstards out. They ain’t got no couth and the mama-hunchers stinking from drinking. And cussing too.”
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Solly	But how in the hell could he love two women? Another thing she said to him was, “I hate to say this, [MASK], but there is nothing for us to fight for excepting freedom here at home. All the Negro soldiers should be conscientious objectors.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Jimmy	[MASK]! Don’t forget your rifle!” He blew short quick blasts on the whistle as he dashed toward his tent to get his carbine. Where in the hell was he going and whom was he going to kill and why? boom! boom! boom!
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Jimmy	It must be time for something else.” He stared bleary-eyed at the quiet soldier. “[MASK],” he said as he wiped his eyes with his shirttail, “you’re one of the greatest guys I’ve ever known. I mean it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bookworm	“The same as usual,” [MASK] said, “and the same thing for my buddy." And when the lady turned her back, he loud-talked: “She knows what I want, daddy. I’m here every night.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Worm	[MASK] said, “Tents, clothes, shoes, tree branches, rifles, helmets, gas masks, now and then a skinny soldier, mess kits, cartridge belts, officers and monkeys and bull bats and banana bunches.”
<name>Jojo</name>	Jojo	Solly	I’m here every night. One of these days she’s gonna let me take her home.” [MASK] said jokingly, “Suppose I don’t give you a pass. Those MPs at the gate will whip your head till their arms get weary.”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Samuels	Negroes like himself who understood the deeper meaning of the war. And had ambition. When he finished, [MASK] looked at the papers. “Good job, Corporal. Damn good job. Couldn’t’ve done any better myself.”
<name>Private Slovik</name>	Private Slovik	Rogers	You’re a big boy now. Put your clothes back on.”. . . “Yes, sir!” [MASK] said, as the other soldiers howled with laughter. And then there were aptitude tests and classifications and drilling all day long in the merciless sunlight.
<name>Buggs</name>	Buggs	Scotty	And he realized then how scared he was about them. His heart was beating double-time. To hell with [MASK]. He didn’t want any part of the stockade. A sharp pain in between his buttocks. “We did our best, sir.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Millie	He had a new respect for [MASK]. She was not naive with her opportunism. She was awesomely realistic. And she was for him—first, last, and always. He understood this clearly. She was his woman. She wiped her eyes again.
<name>Kilgore</name>	Kilgore	Solly	“Be sure to tell us the reason. Lieutenant, when you find it,” [MASK] said sarcastically. The next morning right after breakfast the entire 913 Amphibious Company of the Fifteenth Amphibious Regiment marched over to a wide sprawling motor pool where they saw their first amphibious vehicles.
<name>She</name>	She	Millie	He tried to talk her out of her bitterness, tried to bolster his own shaky position. When he came out of it, [MASK] was standing in his arms, her hand caressing the back of his neck. “. . .
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Rutherford	[MASK] hitched his trousers with his elbows. “Now I know we’ve had disagreements and sometimes some of you thought I was hard and strict, but I’ve always done what I thought was best for you. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes.
<name>Ella</name>	Ella	Bookworm	I will fight with all the strength that’s in me the goddamn bloated buzzards who profit from this madness.” He sucked the tears back up his nostrils. He smiled at [MASK]. “And I promise you a Double-V.” His eyes and ears played tricks on him.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Solly	[MASK] closed his book and waited. The doctor wasi probably a queer, he thought. Now they were at his bed, the' doctor and the tired nurse, the dark-eyed sweet-faced one with the blue-black hair and: “How are you this evening, soldier?”
<name>Zar</name>	Zar	Hopjack	All week long they got ready for the Big Invasion. And it seemed like [MASK] finally was going to get the chance he had been begging for. Every evening he’d start down the company street shouting. “Let me at those buckteeth bastards!”
<name>Kilgore</name>	Kilgore	Solly	You couldn’t bomb me outa this hole till morning comes.” They laughed some more. [MASK] said, "We keep up this island hopping we’ll be needing three or four assholes apiece. It’ll be coming out of our ears and noses.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Solly	“It was awful, [MASK]. It was really disgusting! And I didn’t want to do itl I didn’t want to do it! But they kidded me day and night—they said I was a queer or something. Said I didn’t like women.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Solly	“Don’t blame me, [MASK]. Please don’t blame me, darling, about that night. I’m so sorry about everything—” He said violently, “I don’t blame you!” She put her arms around him again.
<name>the captain</name>	the captain	Rutherford	We pride ourselves in our esprit de corps.” The colonel stared at [MASK] long and hard, as if he didn’t believe what his ears heard or his eyes beheld, and a sudden warmth began to collect on the captain’s neck and a redness moved into his face.
<name>my</name>	my	Solly	Nothing more.” And she kissed him one more time and she moved away from him and straightened her dress and wiped her eyes. She said speaking firmly now, “I’m strong now, [MASK] darling, and it’s time for us to go.”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Solly	“I hear you all had a great big heart-to-heart talk out in the woods today.” [MASK] said nothing, his lips pressed together, his eyes narrowing. “Is there anything at all you’d like to tell me, Corporal?”
<name>Harlem</name>	Harlem	Solly	You wanna go along and keep me company?” He laughed to himself. “I gots to make wee-wee.” . [MASK] didn’t see a damn thing funny. The man was trying to make a fool of him and having a howling success.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Solly	[MASK] said slowly and heatedly, “You don’t know shit! You know how I feel? You’re a white man. Don’t get carried away with that Florida tan. Only those who’ve paid the dues can know what it is to members of the Club.”
<name>Bromden</name>	Bromden	Solly	“Or what?” “The other alternative?” “If we tried hard enough we might be able to get you a medical discharge and you could go home and forget it.” [MASK]’s voice was trembling. “What the hell are we waiting for?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Samuels	A worried expression settling over [MASK]’s face now that he had arrived at his destina- tion. He took off his glasses and wiped them with an olive-drab handkerchief. “You want me to stay out here and wait for you, Lieutenant?
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Millie	You have nothing to worry about.” [MASK] blew her hot breath again upon his damp face from across the ocean. And she whispered, “Listen to your head and forget about your emotions!” She cried, "Promotions! Promotions! Promotions!”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Samuels	[MASK]’s face was blood-red now with alcohol and anger which he tried to hide. “You’ve been right about the whole goddamn thing. I admit it. You and your undemocratic cracker Army fighting the war for democracy and your Double-V for Victory.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Buck	[MASK] said, “All right, you little stupid sapsucker, are you going to get back to work or do you want to be charged with insubordination?” He turned and waved his arms. “And that goes for all of you bastards!”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Solly	They picked up speed after they reached the top of the incline at the middle of the bridge and it was downhill all the way. It was the first time [MASK] saw the gunner smile even though it was a nervous smile.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Colonel	Sly and not to be trusted and you could never read their faces. “I don’t like to sound immodest, [MASK]. The major can speak more objectively.” The major cleared his throat and spoke in a flat voice.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Solly	"You ain’t just a-bullshitting!" [MASK] said, “Why don’t you guys grow up? You act like a bunch of fifteen-year-old kids. What have you against women?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Worm	And he was remembering now the letter he and [MASK] had written, signed by others in the company. Romantic, idealistic, which were other words for stupid. Never again would he let his feelings run away with his common sense.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Saunders	The captain said, “I don’t have to ask you, [MASK], you know that. I can order you, and break you if you refuse, but it’s a job you got to believe in or you’ll mess it up, and I’m giving you one more chance to consider.
<name>Private Trip</name>	Private Trip	Solly	[MASK] said, “Major, how would you feel if you were brought into your country’s Army only to be treated as something filthy and unclean and to be spat upon contemptuously? Put yourself in our place.”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Millie	He had put it off too long. The next day at noon he got a letter from home. He came upstairs in the barracks and sat on his bunk, and [MASK] always wrote the same way she talked. He was afraid to open it at first.
<name>Her</name>	Her	Celia	He didn’t see or hear from [MASK] for three days, and the evening of the third day she phoned him and asked him, “How about taking a walk with me?” He said, "Sure—I’d love to.”
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Celia	He felt if somebody stuck pins in him all over him, he wouldn’t feel a goddamn thing. And it’s all your fault, you procrastinating bastard. You should have written to her months ago, and you have no one else to blame but you. Spending all your time with [MASK].
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Worm	He remonstrated. Finally the dice rolled three and two. [MASK] raked the green stuff in without a word. A voice said softly, “Look at that little lucky black bastard!” Pieces of breeze drifted quietly and determinedly through the funk of the stinking hatch.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Millie	She put her arm through his and he almost jumped, and he looked sideways down into her face, and he saw so much beauty and loveliness and happiness and contentment, it almost scared him to death. He would have to tell her tonight about [MASK].
<name>his father</name>	his father	Scotty	He straightened up and looked around him and he opened his mouth and closed his eyes and drank the air in deeply all inside of him, and it was just like [MASK] used to say, “You close your eyes you lose sight on the world, and you won’t ever see again.”
<name>Kennedy</name>	Kennedy	Solly	There was an almost imperceptible movement behind a park bench in the plaza as two M—1 rifles took careful aim at [MASK], letting him come closer and closer so they could blow his head away. Closer closer closer—they could not miss him if they tried to.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Solly	“I ought to have you on a Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street. We’d string your peckerwood ass up on one of them lampposts in front of the Hotel Theresa.” [MASK] put the jeep in first and suddenly pulled away from the headquarters and started down the road.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Solly	You’re married. You’re always telling me you’re married. Besides, the Kid don’t give up so easy—see?” There was nothing for [MASK] to say. Just be silent and look stupid.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Rogers	Some of the men stared quietly at their plates; some looked sideways te see if any other poor fool would bite; some cleared their throats significantly and bit into the bully beef. But nobody bit. Not even eager-beaver Sergeant [MASK].
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Worm	The hard pain in his belly made him think his guts would burst wide open. She had a round scared face and big black eyes and that was easily thirteen years ago. [MASK] got quietly behind the wheel and took a deep breath and backed noiselessly into the water and turned toward the burning island.
<name>Slim</name>	Slim	Rutherford	He stood in the doorway, barring their progress, long and lank like [MASK], with his hand resting carelessly on his forty-five and a friendly smile on his face. “Now wait a minute, boys. Ain’t no hurry.”
<name>Mississippi</name>	Mississippi	Solly	Nebraska com-husker. “What’s the matter with you, boy?” He asked good-naturedly. [MASK] tried to stop laughing. “Nothing, officer.” Laughter still oozing out of him in bubbles. “You all right. Miss?”
<name>her</name>	her	Pam	He said, “What?” “That you’ll go in the house and keep [MASK] at arm’s length and take a good nap and a nice hot bath and relax, before you come to my house for dinner before the party.”
<name>Kiowa</name>	Kiowa	Solly	Their faces looked like shrunken bears, and they were irritable and vicious when you disturbed them in the daytime. An apple- cheeked boy of the Third Platoon stood next to [MASK], head-high in grass and bamboo, swinging his machete, when suddenly he fell as if chopped down by his own machete.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Solly	“All right,” [MASK] said. “But the thing for you to do right now is to take a shower and hit the sack and get some rest and get on sick call in the morning. Let the doctor examine you.
<name>Kilgore</name>	Kilgore	Solly	“I don’t make the regulations, friend. I’m a soldier just like you. I’m just doing my job like they tell me to do.” A fire was building in his stomach. [MASK] said, "What is this anyhow?
<name>Captain Ahab</name>	Captain Ahab	Scott	Its port side seemed to come up out of the water and reach vainly for the black sky, which seemed to reach for it, and then with the same rhythm it seemed to submerge beneath the ocean’s black and foamy surface. [MASK] was the freest bravest meanest bastard in the world.
<name>Joker</name>	Joker	Buck	Besides these fucking bunks might be wired for sound.” He jumped up and turned one of the cots over and started to examine it. The men laughed. [MASK] was forever clowning when the officers were absent. “Don’t laugh,” he said.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Saunders	I caught you with your pants down and you have nothing to brag about. What happened to your balls, Lieutenant? “Let’s get back to camp, [MASK]. I must attend this special meeting at regimental.” He was white as a soda cracker.
<name>he</name>	he	Solly	He thought his eyes had filled with tears of gladness. But then another whistle blew from the platform across the way from them. And when [MASK] looked he saw the chalkfaced captain’s silver bars blinking in the sunlight and the captain waving his arms to the lieutenant.
<name>Johnnie</name>	Johnnie	Solly	[MASK] swallowed hard and the saliva stuck in his throat like glue. His nerves were sharp as a razor’s edge double-edged. They were outnumbered twenty to one but he was ready. He didn’t have to debate about this war right here and now.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Solly	And before [MASK] knew it he was being chased by a big burly white cop shouting, “Goddamn little nigger!” and his back was exposed to the policeman’s pistol and fright moved through him like an open wound, expecting to be shot down any second.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Celia	He had to go now and felt an empty aching loneliness deep in the guts of him. He put his hands on [MASK]’s shoulders. She reached out and gently touched his troubled face and backed away. “Good night, dear friend.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Scotty	A few minutes later the captain came quietly into the orderly room. He was as white as an unsalted soda cracker, with long deep ridges in his apoplectic forehead. He didn’t even glance in the direction of [MASK]. “You keep the prisoner here.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Solly	[MASK] looked from face to face of the men again and back toward the shore which was closer now and clearer in its handsome rugged outline, as dawn barely began to lift itself from behind the mountain about a mile in from the coast.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Rogers	“All right! All right! You, soldier, you!” The little book-reading soldier looked up from his bunk at [MASK]. He was about five feet four or five, but built solid up from the ground and a heavyweight from shoulder to shoulder.
<name>John</name>	John	Solly	[MASK] thought, great God, if I n)ust die this morning, let me lose my life for something. And the PT boats chugging all over the place sending up their inevitable smoke screens and making their man-made fog.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Solly	She was young but overly concerned with growing old and leaving no footprints in the swiftly shifting sands of time. This night she could not take rejection, especially from [MASK]. Pleasel Love me—care about me—see some beauty in my life.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Samuels	All night long he and [MASK] and the gunner had shot their way up one street and down the other, not knowing whom they killed or how damn many, and he didn’t even know the gunner’s name.
<name>Randle</name>	Randle	Solly	Let’s just sit here a few more minutes.” [MASK] said, “Come on now. Don’t fall asleep. We have to get the hell out of this place. Got to find—come on—come on. Don’t fall asleep.”
<name>hours</name>	hours	Freedom	They lay so quietly for [MASK]. A few more Ack-Ack men came up, and the fresh men of the 913 pitched in, and they shakily continued to put the gun in place, and they surrounded the gun with walls of sandbags.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Solly	[MASK] rounded up some of the men, and they along with the medics began to round up those who would never be men again. Of course they only took the wounded. They left the dead for later consideration and the Graves Registration boys.
<name>Soldini</name>	Soldini	Solly	The captain told them, “This is it for tonight, men. Any questions? Have a nice meal and get some rest. Got a busy day tomorrow.” And took off hurriedly in his commandeered jeep. [MASK] laughed bitterly and looked around him.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Solly	[MASK] thought, so now I’m not only an intelligent stockholding Army-lover smd Cap’n Charlie’s boy. I’m also the CO’s pet. I’m really getting up in the world. And everybody’s got my number.
<name>Jefferson</name>	Jefferson	Rutherford	"When my namesake freed the slaves, he didn’t know about [MASK]’s plantation, I bet a great big fat man.” CHAPTER 15 He sat wearily on his cot after mail call and just before the call for supper.
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Solly	And now it was the night before the great invasion morning. [MASK] stayed on deck till late. It was moonless. Not a single star up there. A perfect night for invasion. He stood gazing over the side of the ship.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Solly	Perspiration crawled all over [MASK]. Maybe I should tell the captain I’m the guilty one. Tell him I did it when I first went into the hospital. > . i “What plotting are you talking about. Captain, sir?”
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Solly	and he kissed her and her arms went up around his neck and her open mouth wet against his open mouth and she strained her entire body for him and felt like she was falling from the peak of some high mountaintop, and she felt like screaming: Save me, [MASK]!
<name>Don</name>	Don	Solly	Varying shades of brown and black. Clashing and blending. And in between her thighs now the wet crotch of her panties told his happy hand how much she wanted him, even as she shouted angrily, “No, [MASK], no! I don’t want to!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Solly	“Ready for what?” [MASK] tried to keep his voice from trembling. “I’m a master sergeant. That’s supposed to make me a leader, and a leader is supposed to be with his men when they move against the enemy.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Randy	[MASK] said, “I didn’t have no goddamn freedom down on the farm where I come from. I worked from sunup to sundown and didn’t never get nowhere. I ain’t had no education or nuthin like that.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Solly	At least we’d been able to set up light housekeeping before night came.” [MASK] said, “The man didn’t want you to disembark in the heat of the day. He waited till the cool of the evening. Looking out for your comfort all the time.”
