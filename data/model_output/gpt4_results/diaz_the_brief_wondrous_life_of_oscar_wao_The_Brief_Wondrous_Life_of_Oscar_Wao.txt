<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Constantina	In her twenties, sunny and amiable, whose cuerpo was all pipa and no culo, a “mujer alegre” (in the parlance of the period). More than once [MASK] arrived to lunch straight from a night of partying, smelling of whiskey and stale cigarettes.
<name>Tyrell</name>	Tyrell	Manny	He snorted. What would you have to write about? I’m into the more speculative genres. He knew how absurd he sounded. The more speculative genres. [MASK] looked ready to cut a steak off him. You sound mad corny, guy, you know that?
<name>black</name>	black	Dominican	That, alas, didn’t happen. The white kids looked at his black skin and his afro and treated him with inhuman cheeriness. The kids of color, upon hearing him speak and seeing him move his body, shook their heads. You’re not [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Oscar	He spoke to her plainly and without effort and discovered that his constant self-deprecation pleased her immensely. It was amazing how it was between them; he would say something obvious and uninspired, and she’d say, [MASK], you’re really fucking smart.
<name>he</name>	he	Oscar	but then they both started whaling on him with their pistols. It’s not clear whether they intended to scare him or kill him. Maybe the capitan had ordered one thing and they did another. Perhaps they did exactly what he asked, or perhaps [MASK] just got lucky.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Oscar	Was allowing himself only ten of his books, the core of his canon (his words), was trying to pare it all down to what was necessary. Only what I can carry. It seemed like another odd [MASK] thing, until later we would realize it wasn’t.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Lola	[MASK], who actually cried when she saw the state I was in. She was the one who took care of my sorry ass. Cooked, cleaned, picked up my classwork, got me medicine, even made sure that I showered.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Tomoko	Of course I cried; I was eight and I had already planned that [MASK] and her family would adopt me. My mother of course saw clean into the marrow of those dreams, and laughed. I wouldn’t write to you either, she said.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Lillian	But it is the fate of women everywhere to be miserable always, [MASK] declared, and then she was gone and only the cheap freebie calendar she liked marking off remained. A week later the Brothers Then hired a replacement. A new girl.
<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Homes	[MASK] had it bad\ couldn’t so much as see a cute girl without breaking into shakes. Developed crushes out of nothing—must have had at least two dozen high-level ones that first semester alone. Not that any of these shits ever came to anything.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Lola	I just nodded my head, said, See you around, [MASK], and drove home. That should have been the end of it, right? Just a memory of some nerd I once knew who tried to kill himself, nothing more, nothing more.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lola	Despite my promises to [MASK] to watch out, those first couple weeks I didn’t have much to do with him. I mean, what can I say? I was busy. What state school player isn’t?
<name>He</name>	He	Oscar	She put her fingers on his hand and told him that she could never be with him again. For some reason [MASK] couldn’t see her face, it was a blur, she had retreated completely into that other plane of hers. Heard only the sorrow of her breathing.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Karen	[MASK] asked uncertainly. Yes, I said. The next day my mother threw the wig at me. You’re going to wear this. You’re going to wear it every day. And if I see you without it on I’m going to kill you!
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Ana	There’s no time! he’d insist, peeling out, shoot a couple more looters (now slightly mutated), and then repair to the sweaty love den where [MASK] would quickly succumb to his take-charge genius and his by-then ectomorphic physique.
<name>Ricardo</name>	Ricardo	Abelard	In this climate, hoarding your women was tantamount to treason; offenders who didn’t cough up the muchachas could easily find themselves enjoying the invigorating charm of an eight-shark bath. Let us be clear: [MASK] was taking an enormous risk.
<name>Hari</name>	Hari	Abelard	A book about the Dark Powers of the President, a book in which [MASK] argued that the tales the common people told about the president—that he was supernatural, that he was not human—may in some ways have been true.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Jack	I’d come to know, but one must remember: she was young and in love. Talk about fantasist: the girl sincerely believed that [MASK] would be true. The Good Teachers of El Redentor never squeezed anything close to a mea culpa from the girl.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Oscar	Only one thing sticks out. Right before I headed out, he said: It was the curse that made me do it, you know. I don’t believe in that shit, [MASK]. That’s our parents’ shit. It’s ours too, he said.
<name>Tío</name>	Tío	Rudolfo	One bag, two hundred dollars in tips, ti'o [MASK]’s old knife. I was so scared. I couldn’t stop shaking. The whole ride down I was expecting the sky to split open and my mother to reach down and shake me.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Abelard	On his days off, when he wasn’t at the clinic or in his study, writing, [MASK] would stand at his rear window and watch his daughters at their silly childrens game until his aching heart could stand it no more.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lola	Well? Well what? Did you fuck her? Jesus, [MASK], he said, blushing. Don’t lie to me. I do not move so precipitously. He paused and then sighed. In other words, I didn’t even get her scarf off.
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	Jose	You a waitress, you tips. How much are they? Once again the glumness. It is without certainty. I don’t understand. His brother [MASK]’s bloodshot eyes glanced up from the sports section. What my brother is saying is that it all depends.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Suriyan	I fished my keys out. So how’s the fiance? He’s fine, she said blandly. Are you and [MASK] still together? Killed to even hear her name. Not for a long time. And then we stood there and stared at each other.
<name>Mami</name>	Mami	Hija	[MASK], she said while frying pastelitos, maybe you need help. But my mother was the worst. It’s the last straw, she screamed. The. Last. Straw. But it always was with her.
<name>She</name>	She	Ybon	He talked about trying to take his own life. This is the only time that [MASK] didn’t say anything. Instead she poured them both drinks and raised her glass. To life! They never discussed the amount of time they spent together.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lola	A year later their mother’s cancer returned and this time it dug in and stayed. I visited her in the hospital with [MASK]. Six times in all. She would live for another ten months, but by then she’d more or less given up.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Ana	He used to read passages to her all the time: That made me so hot. She’d been thirteen when they started dating, he was twenty-four, a recovering coke addict—[MASK] talking about these things like they weren’t nothing at all.
<name>Mikey</name>	Mikey	Oscar	Where was the girl who had noticed him checking out a flaquita the week before and said, half joking, Only a dog likes a bone, [MASK]. Where was the girl who had to try on five different outfits before she left the house?
<name>Y</name>	Y	Beli	He looks at me. And now it was his wife who came to the bakery to pick up the cakes. Y el dentista? [MASK] inquired innocently. That one’s too lazy to do anything, his wife said with no little exasperation.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ana	On the ride home [MASK] complained about having a headache and they didn’t speak for a long time. He tried to turn on the radio but she said, No, my head’s really killing me. He joked, Would you like some crack?
<name>Charlemagne</name>	Charlemagne	Atahualpa	The nigger was some kind of bailer, everybody in the club was paying tribute to him, and he rocked enough gold to have ransomed [MASK]. Let’s just say their first contact was not promising. How about I buy you a drink?
<name>Alcibiades</name>	Alcibiades	Trujillo	He dared not glance away from [MASK]’s heavily powdered face, but out the corner of his eyes he caught glimpses of the lambesacos, hovering, beginning to realize that an exchange was in the making. I have seen you here often, Doctor, but lately without your wife.
<name>he</name>	he	Oscar	All that remained was the image of an Aslan-like figure with golden eyes who kept trying to speak to him but [MASK] couldn’t hear a word above the blare of the merengue coming from the neighbor’s house. Only later, during his last days, would he actually remember one of those dreams.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Rosi'o	When we were done and he was in the bathroom washing himself I stood in front of the mirror naked and looked at my culo for the first time. A tesoro, I repeated. A treasure. Well? [MASK] asked at school.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Rosfo	[MASK] has me dressing up like a “real Dominican girl.” She’s the one who fixed my hair and who helps me with my makeup, and sometimes when I see myself in mirrors I don’t even know who I am anymore.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oscar	The next day I walked into the coffee shop, looking brand-new, and he was there, with the bag. [MASK], I said, laughing, you’re so fat! I know, he said, ashamed. I was worried about you.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Oscar	Trying to make up now that I was due back. So you’re coming home. Don’t count on it, I said. Don’t do anything precipitous. Don’t do anything precipitous. I laughed. Do you ever hear yourself, [MASK]? He sighed.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clives	Didn’t bother to call [MASK], jumped in the first taxi he could find. Once in the parking lot of the Riverside he tried again to kiss her and she turned away with her head, not her body. Please don’t. He’ll kill us.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dude	[MASK] had been waiting his whole life for something just like this to happen to him, had always wanted to live in a world of magic and mystery, but instead of taking note of the vision and changing his ways the fuck just shook his swollen head.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Yunior	He’d hear me out and then shrug. Nothing else has any efficacy, I might as well be myself. But your yourself sucks! It is, lamentably, all I have. But my favorite conversation: [MASK]? What? Are you awake?
<name>Ramirez</name>	Ramirez	Grod	But instead of the muzzle-flash and the eternal dark, [MASK] struck him once hard in the head with the butt of his pistol. For a second the pain broke the yoke of his fear and he found the strength to move his legs and was about to turn and run
<name>John</name>	John	Cabral	[MASK], he said with a smile. You have to be more careful. I love you! she wanted to scream, I want to have all your children! I want to be your woman! But instead she said, You be careful. She was morose.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Oscar	That day what little faith [MASK] had in the world took an SS-N-17 snipe to the head. When finally he couldn’t take it no more he asked, pathetically, What, these girls don’t have any other friends?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Lola	Turned her ruined back to us. I did all I could and it still wasn’t enough. They buried her next to her son, and [MASK] read a poem she had written, and that was it. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Beli	You’re going to burn the pan de agua!) She wasn’t the only girl dreaming like this. This jiringonza was in the air, it was the dreamshit that they fed girls day and night. It’s surprising [MASK] could think of anything else, what with 8.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Lydia	I’d be sure to have ugly daughters. [MASK] was far more realistic. She’d been seated at her armoire, brushing her Moorish hair. He’d been lying on the bed, naked as well, absently pulling on his ripio.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Juan	Which for a man any less righteous would have been an open invitation but [MASK] simply sighed: No obligated be without shame. We try you up. Probationary period. Can’t promises build. Political conditions give promises no hospitality. What’s my salary? Salary!
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Lydia	She’d been seated at her armoire, brushing her Moorish hair. He’d been lying on the bed, naked as well, absently pulling on his ripio. [MASK] had said, Send her away to the nuns.
<name>Chango</name>	Chango	Beli	I made myself, he told [MASK], all by myself. I have cars, houses, electricity, clothes, prendas, but when I was a nino I didn’t even own a pair of shoes. Not one pair. I had no family.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Aldo	And so bored. But of course I wouldn’t admit it. I had run away, so I was happy! Happy! [MASK] had neglected to mention all those times he told me to live with him that his father hated him like I hated my mother.
<name>Rosita</name>	Rosita	Sobeida	Every year I came home from the States, it was the same thing; quiet hardworking [MASK] would stop in for a second to say a word to my abuelo and my mother (and also to watch a couple of minutes of a novela) before running off to finish her next chore.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Constantina	A week later the Brothers Then hired a replacement. A new girl. [MASK]. In her twenties, sunny and amiable, whose cuerpo was all pipa and no culo, a “mujer alegre” (in the parlance of the period).
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mami	She’s working. What a surprise, I said. [MASK] working. On the last minute of the last hour of the last day my mother would be at work. She would be at work when the missiles were in the air.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	OSCAR	Lost everything to an eleven-year-old punk and found himself not really caring. First sign that his Age was coming to a close. When the latest nerdery was no longer compelling, when you preferred the old to the new.) [MASK] TAKES A VACATION
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Abuela	She was still spry and proud and when she saw him, first time in nearly seven years, she put her hands on his shoulders and said, Mi hijo, you have finally returned to us. Hi, [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Beli	The proof was the day that one of their customers, the local dentist, slipped her a note with his money, and it said, I want to see you, as simple as that. [MASK] was terrified, scandalized, and giddy.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Jackie	Suspicious, angry, scowling, uncommunicative, a wounded hungering campesina, but with an expression and posture that shouted in bold, gothic letters: DEFIANT. Darkskinned but clearly her family’s daughter. Of this there was no doubt. Already taller than [MASK] in her prime.
<name>She</name>	She	Ana	[MASK] seemed unaccountably sad and she chewed her bottom lip, a real bemba, until most of her lipstick was on her teeth. He was going to make a comment about it but decided not to. You reading anything good? Nope, she said. You?
<name>ain't</name>	ain't	Dominicans	That’s white people for you. They lose a cat and it’s an all-points bulletin, but we [MASK], we lose a daughter and we might not even cancel our appointment at the salon. By November I was so finished.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Abelard	Sometimes a fragment of a shell or a dying horseshoe crab would catch [MASK]’s attention and he’d get down on all fours and examine it with a gem-cutter’s glass so that to both his delighted daughters, as well as to his appalled wife, he resembled a dog sniffing a turd.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Beli	[MASK] asked. A crooked-tooth smile. Me, I’m going to the Hollywood for a dance. I have un buen amigo working in the door and from what I hear there’ll be a whole assembly fine of rich men with nothing to do but adore me, ay sf.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Dude	He coughed. I have heard from a reliable source that no Dominican male has ever died a virgin. You who have experience in these matters—do you think this is true? I sat up. [MASK] was peering at me in the dark, dead serious.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Fuku	Should I celebrate, he asked the dresser, or should I cry? Other insights? One day while watching his mother tear sheets off the beds it dawned on him that the family curse he’d heard about his whole life might actually be true. [MASK].
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Oscar	Attacked me on the E bus. The boys laughing and running, and me pretending like I hadn’t done anything. Suddenly I was in the dorm a lot. Taking a stab at a story or two. Watching some movies with [MASK].
<name>Fire</name>	Fire	Oscar	They waited respectfully for him to finish and then they said, their faces slowly disappearing in the gloom, Listen, we’ll let you go if you tell us what fuego means in English. Fire, he blurted out, unable to help himself. [MASK]— The End of the Story T
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Lola	Looked for the coffee shop where he had saved [MASK], but it had closed. Nothing had opened to replace it. One night he picked up a hitchhiker. An immensely pregnant girl. She barely spoke any English. Was a wetback Guatemalan with pits in her cheek.
<name>Tamika</name>	Tamika	Beli	I mean, what straight middle-aged brother has not attempted to regenerate himself through the alchemy of young pussy. And if what she often said to her daughter was true, [MASK] had some of the finest pussy around.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Aldo	What can I really tell you about him? He was like all boys: beautiful and callow, and like an insect he couldn’t sit still. Un blanquito with long hairy legs I met one night at Limelight. His name was [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Oscar	I love him. Love. [MASK] knew he should have checked out right then. He liked to kid himself that it was only cold anthropological interest that kept him around to see how it would all end, but the truth was he couldn’t extricate himself.
<name>She</name>	She	Oscar	And then [MASK] called, out of the blue. Trying to make up now that I was due back. So you’re coming home. Don’t count on it, I said. Don’t do anything precipitous. Don’t do anything precipitous. I laughed.
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Abelard	If he wants your daughter at the party you can do nothing but obey. But this isn’t human! When has this country ever been human, [MASK]? You’re the historian. You of all people should know that.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Oscar	I know it’s not going to work. Come on, [MASK], pick up your goddamn feet. But he shook his head. He tried to squeeze my hand and then walked to the Livingston Ave. stop, took the Double E home.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Beli	At the end of her life, when she was being eaten alive by cancer, [MASK] would talk about how trapped they all felt. It was like being at the bottom of an ocean, she said. There was no light and a whole ocean crushing down on you.
<name>Arda</name>	Arda	Arda	The shadow of my purpose lies upon [MASK], and all that is in it bends slowly and surely to my will. But upon all whom you love my thought shall weigh as a cloud of Doom, and it shall bring them down into darkness and despair.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Arquimedes	To his credit, [MASK] acquitted himself in a more mature fashion. (Maybe because she told him first and had not yet grown flip.) After her confession she heard a “little noise” from the closet where he was hiding and nothing else.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Oscar	(If you call being fuku’d, being beyond misery, OK.) But this ain’t no Marvel Comics What if?—speculation will have to wait—time, as they say, is growing short. That May, [MASK] was, for once, in better spirits.
<name>Belicia</name>	Belicia	Beli	But, still, for a girl like [MASK] it was a precursor of things to come. When she returned to the house in the late afternoon she announced: I have a job! La Inca snorted. I guess the cabarets are always hiring.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Lola	Sure I wanted to help [MASK] out, watch out for her crazy-ass brother (knew he was the only thing she really loved in this world), but I was also taking care of my own damn self.
<name>her</name>	her	Lola	I will play Street Fighter no more. Well? I said to [MASK] later on the phone. I don’t know, she said. He gets like this sometimes. What do you want me to do? Just watch him for me, OK?
<name>Laurel</name>	Laurel	Ybon	The road where he became so nuts over a girl he stopped thinking. The road where very bad things happened. You should stop right now, he told himself. But he knew, with lapidary clarity, that he wasn’t going to stop. He loved [MASK].
<name>Castro</name>	Castro	Batista	Of the eighty-two revolutionaries who splashed ashore, only twenty-two survived to celebrate the New Year, including one book-loving argentino. A bloodbath, with [MASK]’s forces executing even those who surrendered. But these twenty-two, it would prove, were enough.
<name>speed-dial</name>	speed-dial	Douglass	Should have sat my ass in that chair and told him that shit was going to be cool, but it was our last night and I was fucking tired of him. I wanted to fuck silly this Indian girl I had on [MASK], smoke a joint, and then go to bed.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Scarypants	I said, So, what’s up with you and [MASK]? Nothing. What the hell you two talk about? Items of little note. Something about his tone made me realize that he knew about her scorching me. The fucker.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Karen	When she threw away my Smiths and Sisters of Mercy posters—Aqui yo no quiero maricones—I bought replacements. When she threatened to tear up my new clothes, I started keeping them in my locker and at [MASK]’s house.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Clives	What? You’ll see, was all he would say. And then the expected happened. One night he and [MASK] were driving back from the World Famous Riverside and they had to stop at a light and that was where two men got into the cab with them.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Oscar	Most of the time they took turns striking him, but sometimes they got into it together and there were moments [MASK] was sure that he was being beaten by three men, not two, that the faceless man from in front of the colmado was joining them.
<name>Kimota</name>	Kimota	Jacob	She watched hungrily for visitors from out of town, threw open her arms at the slightest hint of a wind and at night she struggled [MASK]-like against the ocean pressing down on her. kimota! c kJo what happened? A boy happened. Her First.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Jose	That’ s right, tranquila now, the larger one said. What a sad ending it would have been had not our girl rolled her luck and spotted [MASK] Then ambling back from one of his gambling trips, a rolled newspaper under his arm.
<name>Castro</name>	Castro	Ramfis	(In a secret report filed by the US consul, currently available at the JFK Presidential Library, [MASK] is described as “imbalanced,” a young man who during his childhood amused himself by blowing the heads off chickens with a .44 revolver.)
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Beli	For her whole life she would hate them, never forgive, never forgive, and she would never be able to think of them without succumbing to a vortex of rage. Anyone else would have turned her face from the blows, but [MASK] offered hers up.
<name>Madly</name>	Madly	Beli	I didn’t mean to do it! I didn’t mean it! And it was on one of those nights, while she cradled his head and brushed away his tears, that she realized with a start that she loved this Gangster. [MASK] in love!
<name>Belicia</name>	Belicia	Beli	She told her vecinos that the baby had died. Some people believed her. [MASK], after all, had been ailing for a while. The tiniest litde negrita on the planet. Fuku, part three. But most folks figured that she had sold the girl to some other family.
<name>Abelard</name>	Abelard	Oscar	[MASK] hadn’t been home in years, not since his abuela’s number-one servant, bedridden for months and convinced that the border was about to be reinvaded, had screamed out Haitians! and then died, and they’d all gone to the funeral.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Oscar	These were [MASK]’s furies, his personal pantheon, the girls he most dreamed about and most beat off to and who eventually found their way into his little stories. In his dreams he was either saving them from aliens or he was returning to the neighborhood, rich and famous—It’s him!
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Oscar	The only thing that came close was how he felt about his books; only the combined love he had for everything he’d read and everything he hoped to write came even close. Every Dominican family has stories about crazy loves, about niggers who take love too far, and [MASK]’s family was no different.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Constantina	They were in his apartment on the Malecon—at least he showed you his house, [MASK] would later crack—and if he had been a better righty she would have ended up brained, perhaps raped and killed, but his fastball only grazed her and then it was her turn on the mound.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Oscar	His heart beating so hard he thought he would die but all she did when she picked him up was say, [MASK], listen to the bullshit my sister pulled, and off they’d gone, building another one of their word-scrapers.
<name>Words</name>	Words	Miracles	[MASK] only go so far. He watched her for the signs, signs that would tell him she loved him. He began to suspect that it might not happen this summer, but already he had plans to come back for Thanksgiving, and then for Christmas.
<name>Trujillo</name>	Trujillo	Trujillo	Ask any of your elders and they will tell you: [MASK] might have been a Dictator, but he was a Dominican Dictator, which 25. He wished that could also have been the case with his Balaguer contact.
