<name>me</name>	me	Apley	It seemed to [MASK] that justice should take its course, unimpeded by the parades, placards and denouncements of certain elements whose increasing purpose has patently been to undermine society as determined by our Constitution.) This parenthesis, however, brings us far afield.
<name>Marquis de Sade</name>	Marquis de Sade	Freud	I am writing by this same mail to the Trustees of the Athenaeum asking that all works by [MASK] be put into the Locked Room. They are certainly too strong for public consumption and certainly not the books which an Athenaeum Proprietor wishes to have exposed for an unmarried girl’s perusal.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Papanti	It is not difficult to perceive that these early days at [MASK]’s leave behind their train of friendly memories. Many a romance had its inception in this atmosphere, particularly at the more grown-up series of evening dances which we attended later.
<name>Dora</name>	Dora	Eleanor	Your mother is writing to you about this also, but, as you know, she has not our breadth of view. I need not tell you to keep this matter entirely to yourself as any further talk might do [MASK] everlasting harm.
<name>my son</name>	my son	Louise	No ordeal that I have experienced, and I have passed through several lately, is greater than parenthood. I am glad [MASK] is doing well and I am sending my dear daugh-ter-in-law your grandmother’s pearl chaplet which has not seen the light for a long while.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Walker	[MASK], genial as always, was much surprised at my naivete. I do not object to dancing, as you know, and I flatter myself that I am considered a rather tolerable waltzer, but the steps here are surprising and frequently suggestive.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Apley	With this prelude it is necessary to turn to the episode, so well known and so frequently misunderstood, when [MASK] appeared in the center of the stage to take up the cudgels against a lawyer and a faithless civil servant.
<name>unfortunately</name>	unfortunately	John	I consider this quite often without arriving at any just rationalization. It is, I think, because you and I have been born into a certain environment with very definite inherited instincts. We cannot escape that environment, [MASK], because it is a part of you and me.
<name>humanity</name>	humanity	Boston	Many who remember the occasion will recollect that the matter became a piece of public property, the justice of which was discussed with some acrimony. To one who knows our world this is not peculiar, since [MASK] always has been hospitable to problems involving a moral issue.
<name>Japan</name>	Japan	Apley	As has been said, out of the rich store of material available, these letters have been chosen almost at random. Yet even this casual selection is sufficient to illustrate the eagerness in [MASK] to assimilate new ideas and the inevitable difficulty which he experienced in the assimilation.
<name>no one</name>	no one	Salter	When it comes to uncovering the manifest corruption which exists in the municipal affairs, 1 am behind [MASK] heart and soul. I am ashamed at the cowardice manifested by so many persons who should know better and who are high enough up in business to be leaders of the community.
<name>him</name>	him	Budd	As far as I know she has not written to [MASK] for the last three days. Your mother and I both think that she is getting over it, and that is reason enough for the sacrifice we make in being here. .1
<name>she</name>	she	Eleanor	I cannot understand this; neither can your mother. In our day a girl was brought up to understand that her first duty was to find a suitable husband and to establish a home of her own. Surely [MASK] must realize this.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Eleanor	[MASK], who appears to have read about it, endeavoured to explain something of the theory, but the Monets at the Art Museum are radical enough for me. I want to know what I am looking at. Surely so does everyone else in his proper senses.
<name>Harvard</name>	Harvard	Bostonian	There were all sorts of administrative affairs that had to do with dozens of small businesses at the office. Then there was his Club life, and his interest in undergraduate activities. All these matters were assuming for him a peculiar and completely overestimated importance, so characteristically [MASK].
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Salter	In many ways [he writes] I wish that I had embraced criminal law, for there is certainly nothing humdrum about this business, and one is face to face with life. [MASK] is a brick about everything. He has detailed two investigators under my orders.
<name>F. Scott Fitzgerald</name>	F. Scott Fitzgerald	Apley	It seems so much more beautiful to me than the crass realism of present fiction. She had grown a trifle stout. Age had touched her, as it has touched us all, but still she was very beautiful. The above quotation is ample evidence of [MASK]’s idealism.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Eleanor	A great many of us cannot do everything we want. I want, for instance, to go abroad with your mother, you, and [MASK], next summer; but I cannot because of business reasons and because of your grandmother’s weak heart.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	John	He changed the subject and began speaking of my immediate plans, but later, when he opened the bottle of Madeira, he came back to it again. “[MASK],” he said, “as man to man, is there anyone you care about?”
<name>J. Edgar Hoover</name>	J. Edgar Hoover	Apley	In such large enforcement organizations there must of necessity be certain unscrupulous members. [MASK]’s own son took this point of view, and a letter of his from his father’s files deals plainly with the case in a language which this writer will not claim for his own.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Washington	It is not the hair of either my grandfather or father, and no one else, as far as I know, has ever opened these pages. I wonder if it could be [MASK]’s and I send it to you in the envelope enclosed herewith, in the hope that you may solve this mystery.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Eleanor	How my daughter, my own little girl, should be able to abide such a man is more than I can imagine. Though I may not have always shown it, [MASK] has always seemed to me one of the most delicate, sweet, and sensitive flowers in our family.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Apley	It was this same group which was to stand guard against radical activities during the first turbulent years of the Russian Revolution. It is true, as [MASK] was the first to admit, that such small efforts were only a part of every citizen’s duty—small sacrifices to be made cheerfully and without stint.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	It may seem strange to you that the idea surprised me in that it was new to me. Your Great-Uncle [MASK]’s house has always seemed to me a part of him and, therefore, not subject to change.
<name>old sport</name>	old sport	Will	Full of light and laughter—“Sweet college years with pleasure rife”—we may not have learned much, [MASK]; we may have had our heartburnings and our jealousies, but we had a high old time. I’ll tell you something confidentially.
<name>her</name>	her	Eleanor	She must lead her own life. I have led mine. The wedding, of course, was an important one, and I think at last my new son-in-law understands what he is getting into. He seemed quite shaken when I gave [MASK] away.
<name>Wendell Willkie</name>	Wendell Willkie	Apley	As the conflict spread and its vital issues became more pronounced, until it was patent that democracy and all human freedom were in the balance, [MASK] became more and more bewildered at the indifference of the rest of the country to this truth.
<name>Fitzgerald</name>	Fitzgerald	Walker	It is fortunate that something of his reaction is still extant in a communication to his friend [MASK], now in this writer’s hands. I have been very deeply moved this afternoon [he writes] and I am still a little bewildered at myself.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Mabel	There is only one thing in your letter I am sorry for. It is not right to make remarks on the appearance of other people, particularly of your dear relations. Your Aunt [MASK] would be very sorry if she were to think that you had written of her stoutness.
<name>Mr. Guppy</name>	Mr. Guppy	Searing	Under the circumstances I have been obliged to send for [MASK] here at the office and I have also spoken to his parents. I will do him the justice to say that he was contrite about the whole affair; and I believe, within limits, acted like a gentleman.
<name>Carnegie</name>	Carnegie	Apley	I think that everyone concerned in this affair is to be congratulated. The actual details of these negotiations have never been made public, nor is there any need to speculate upon them at present except to say that whatever they may have been, they were a result of [MASK]’s generosity.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eleanor	It appears that these two went without chaperonage to a certain roadhouse on the Newburyport Turnpike, of which [MASK] says you have sometimes spoken. I have found after inquiry in certain quarters that this place is frequented by stenographers and worse.
<name>him</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description given in the prompt)	him (Note: There is no proper name that fits the description given in the prompt)	Apley	Those who were close to [MASK] at the time know best the pain that was caused him by this complex affair. In spite of his satisfaction in knowing that the stand he had taken was just, it was hard to pay the cost of losing the affection of a relative and a lifelong friend.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Apley	I do not care to reconsider it. When one recalls the ensuing excitement it is not surprising to find floods of protest still extant. There were letters of expostulation and letters of pleading from many who realized the embarrassments which [MASK]’s stand would cause.
<name>John</name>	John	Thomas	“[MASK],” I said, “the hot weather has made you very tired; you had better not attempt to go the office to-morrow.” He replied that he should go to the office as he had done always, and then said that he would go to the library to read.
<name>Blackmailers</name>	Blackmailers	O’Reilly	His friend has been one of those who has been victimized by [MASK] and requests a personal interview. These poor fellows are all shy. He is afraid to come to the office, but his friend is arranging things so that I can go to the hotel and see him to-morrow afternoon.
<name>old sport</name>	old sport	Will	I’ll tell you something confidentially. Although I don’t understand it myself, I seemed to be standing a good deal more on my own two feet out there than I am to-day in spite of everything. I wonder why—what’s happened to us, [MASK] ?
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Jane	I shall hope that your Aunt [MASK], if she is alive, may be able to attend but you must leave this decision to the doctors of the institution. In other words, I want everything to go as smoothly as though I were here myself to oversee it.
<name>he</name>	he	John	He went into the thing as cheerfully as he might have gone to break- fast and I have been told that his suggestions were very valuable. Without any desire to boast, I know that [MASK] has the makings of a leader in him.
<name>O'Reilly</name>	O'Reilly	Apley	By this time, however, it was too late. Certain slanderous insinuations had come to [MASK]’s ears, emanating from the turbulent political element which has been our curse. According to everything this writer has been able to gather, the man O’Reilly was hotheaded and importunate.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	O’Reilly	and I know now that she has been one of my own people always. When she told me that the man [MASK] was her husband’s cousin this was enough. I cannot and I shall not raise my hand against anything which belongs to her.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Apley	These changes deeply bothered [MASK], and he could not view them all as improvements for the better. In his opinion matters were moving too fast, far too fast. The other day [he writes] I took my customary walk across the Common.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	William	It is a bitter blow and not a little shocking in that it reflects in a sense upon the family name. I had feared for some time that your Great-Uncle [MASK]’s mind was wandering, and now there can be no doubt of it.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Mike	His nurse, both his grandmother and I feel, neglects him shamefully, but he seems to survive it. My real reason for this letter is to ask you to come up to see me. I have not seen you for a long while, [MASK].
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Grandmama	Do you remember the games of hide-and-seek we used to play in the upper hall, and the time [MASK] hid me behind her dress when she sat in her rocker, knitting? Poor old lady, I had been forbidden to go in there, because she was not well, you know.
<name>God</name>	God	Phil	It was not inspiring. New Englanders hitting the high places are generally not a gay party. There were booths, a dance floor, paper streamers, a piano, a lot of painted hussies, and traveling salesmen, but it was sin incarnate to [MASK] and me.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	William	They will, of course, be left by my will to the Museum, just as your Uncle [MASK] proposes to leave his own very extensive collection of Chinese ceramics. No one in our position should consider himself alone, but first he should consider his duty to the community.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Eleanor	It is always a pleasure to write you because I know that I can speak to you freely—a thing which is not always possible hereabouts. [MASK] brought a strange man home to dinner last night, since this seems to be a day of casual acquaintances.
<name>he</name>	he	Thomas	The shock of losing such an influence was corre- spondingly great. It was only when he was removed from their midst forever that they realized the full force of his personality and how this personality had wound itself into every detail of their lives, and how [MASK] assumed chivalrously many unnecessary burdens.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Eleanor	Yesterday, I found that your mother had actually taken this Freud book out of the Athenaeum. She was embarrassed when I found her reading it in the small music-room, and gave as her reason that she wished to know what [MASK] was doing.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Kipling	If there is a certain lack of reticence in their dealings with young girls, who certainly look very sweet and athletic in the new dresses, this frankness is probably all for the best. As [MASK] so aptly puts it, “a kiss or two is nothing to you.”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Amelia	The other day I heard your Aunt [MASK] say: “When I am depressed I remember I am an Apley.” At the time I was amused by the remark. Her self-importance often exasperates and amuses me.
<name>son</name>	son	George	If you wish to drink moderately at meals, it is now your right. As for smoking, although I have enjoyed a cigar after dinner for many years I had rather that you avoided the habit. As for women, I mean to talk to you sometime, [MASK], about this matter.
<name>Harvard</name>	Harvard	Chickering	He suddenly became deservedly popular with the athletic set. In a letter which he wrote much later to his classmate, [MASK], he speaks amusingly of his own reactions at that time—probably, as he said, one of the most important periods in his life.
<name>me</name>	me	Eleanor	Perhaps it would be better if people realized that happiness comes only by indirection, that it can never exist by any conscious effort of the will. I think this is a mistake that you and [MASK] and all the rest of you are making.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Phil	I had one gin fizz, and [MASK] may have had more. Back in the car he asked if it would be all right to kiss me even if we were not engaged, and he did once, though we both felt rather guilty about it.
<name>Mr. Gatz</name>	Mr. Gatz	Reid	[MASK], who has grown to be pretty much of an “old fogey” now that he is growing older, has obliged me to take another office across the hall as he says that my new clients, as he calls them, disturb our old clients who come in to discuss their investments.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Apley	There are some plans of my own which I wish to speak about at any rate. . . . This letter requires but little comment. It represents a practical and compromising point of view which was for- eign to [MASK]’s nature when he was thoroughly aroused.
<name>the author</name>	the author	Apley	The author has heard other friends of his—too many— make this same remark. He believes that it reflects merely the restiveness of a man who sees the course of his life lie clear ahead. This restiveness of [MASK]’s is characteristic of the man, but on the whole he overcame this handicap.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	William	You must learn that there is a zest and a genuine satisfaction to spending money properly as your Uncle [MASK] spent his. There is not much place in this world for personal gratification, nor is this particularly becoming to people of our position.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hugo	She said the girls were in the parlour. [MASK]’s ignorance was such, or perhaps his condition, that the painted cheeks and carmined lips of the creatures in that close, heavily scented, brilliantly lighted room gave him no message of warning.
<name>he</name>	he	Apley	If [MASK] was not able at the time to envisage the broader aspects of the situation, he and the rest of his family carried off the affair with instinctive dignity. There was never a breath of criticism heard outside of the family circle.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Henry	Dear [MASK]:— Through a piece of mismanagement which I cannot believe is any fault of yours, your mother’s remains have been placed in a spot in our family ground which I have always felt was tacitly at the disposal of our branch.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Eleanor	It started with a cold I contracted from looking too long at the sunset. It developed into influenza. I still am very weak. The only good that has come out of all this trip is what it may do for [MASK]. She and your mother have been with me constantly.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Walker	I am letting him select them himself and hope you do not mind. Again a short time afterwards we find him writing to his friend, [MASK]:— Can you believe it, my little girl is going to the Friday evenings?
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Jane	I wonder if it would not have been the making of my poor sister, [MASK], who now must have three nurses, if she had gone to such a school. I wonder if there is not something in all this modern trend.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Eleanor	You must be very careful about this when I am gone. One of the most important things these days is to live unostentatiously. Thus nothing has pleased me so much as the belief of [MASK]’s new friend that we are not comfortably off. . . .
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	George	Many of your ancestors on my side have been literary, [MASK]. That you should have inherited this gift is to me like the passing on of a torch, and may the flame be bright! I do not believe I have ever told you this
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Newcomb	[MASK] has overcome his usual reluctance to put himself forward in anything and, of course, will serve. You must do so also. Your name will be of great importance and we must be represented since everyone else will be.
<name>human nature</name>	human nature	Thoreau	He was particularly amused and delighted with the vagaries of [MASK]. He had the deepest respect for the views of our essayists, and even of our novelists, although he felt, I think rightly, that fiction was the most trivial and ephemeral of all the arts.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Hannah	She is growing up and in some way I have never really known her. When she asked me whether I thought anyone would dance with her I could feel a lump rise in my throat. She was setting off with [MASK] to face the world and she was afraid of it.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	William	You were quite right in this. I was only surprised that you had not discovered the fact before. The simplicity of our beginnings makes for your Uncle [MASK]’s simplicity, but do not forget that these ancestors of yours had their beliefs and convictions.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Apley	Second, [MASK]’s son, out of some eccentric wish to deal honestly with his father’s memory by exaggerating certain phases, has demanded its inclusion in spite of all objections. The third reason is a more subtle one.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Catherine	[MASK] has just come in this minute from her dressing room, and has asked me to whom I am writing. She joins her love with mine and her hope with me that all is well with you. .. . The feelings expressed in this letter are such as have no lasting significance.
<name>Eugene O'Neill</name>	Eugene O'Neill	Willing	The author’s word is not necessary for assuring the reader that the whole production was an immense success. The critic from the Boston Advertiser was kind enough to write the next morning: “We have a true dramatist in our midst. His name is [MASK]. . . .
<name>her</name>	her	Eleanor	I was amazed last night to hear [MASK] speak warmly and favorably of such a measure, and I am afraid that her views come from you. I cannot see why you do not understand that such a philosophy is utterly subversive and spoils individual initiative.
<name>the person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	the person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Apley	Compared to this excitement the drama in which [MASK] played a leading part is modest, in that it seems to have concerned only a certain element of the police force backed by a lawyer who appears to have had only the limited support of certain unscrupulous political interests.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Eleanor	I made a great mistake in allowing your mother to read it. It is now in the safe with the silver so that [MASK] cannot lay her hands on it. Things go on here much as usual; I am glad that this is so.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Mike	Well, [MASK], I am the father of a son, and a very strange sensation it is, when one comes to think of it. I can understand a great deal about my own father now that I am one myself.
<name>him</name>	him	Apley	What grieved him most was the impression gained by many that he was a “snob,” for he had always prided himself upon maintaining democratic tolerance and anyone who has seen [MASK] at a single reunion of his college class can be quite sure that this is true.
<name>Gandhi</name>	Gandhi	Apley	I cannot appear in any company any member of which may harbour a doubt regarding my reputation. . . . It is needless to add that [MASK]’s resignation was not accepted, nor was it accepted from any other organization where it was tendered.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Catharine	Shortly afterwards he said in a spirit of pure facetiousness: “Perhaps [MASK] has backed out—but she wouldn’t, would she?” Later he said: “Has it ever occurred to you that marriage is an accident?”
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Apley	Thanks to men of [MASK]’s stamp, who have been able to keep before them through all this stress a realization of abstract right and wrong and a practical philosophy, little real harm has yet been done. The foundations which have been assailed still stand.
<name>William</name>	William	Walker	A great many things have been going on here [we find him writing to his friend [MASK]]. A great many “crackpots” have advanced a great many absurd ideas, but these do not disturb me as they used to.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Apley	•—at which point [MASK] actually gave way to tears. This sign of emotion was received with hearty applause, marred only by a display of carelessness on the part of one of the guests, who stepped out of a window.
<name>the waitress</name>	the waitress	Norah	He replied that he should go to the office as he had done always, and then said that he would go to the library to read. A few moments later, as I was discussing with [MASK], our dear waitress, the arrangements for next morning’s breakfast, I was startled by a heavy fall.
<name>Zelda</name>	Zelda	Catharine	I try to grope back into the past to make myself better understand his ideas and aspirations. Not very successfully, I am afraid. [MASK] says I do not understand him at all, and possibly she is right.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Whittier	In the morning we generally go for a long walk whether it is raining or not. In the afternoon we drive, although the local livery is very expensive considering what they give us. At teatime we read [MASK] and his descriptions of this part of the country chime in very well with our mood.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	George	There is nothing more interesting and more useful all through life than a knowledge of letters. [MASK], darling, I am so glad that you have turned to this recourse, but you must not let your sense of humour get away from you.
<name>Kanaka</name>	Kanaka	Bostonians	For many years after the discovery of the Sandwich Islands all Americans touching there were known to the natives as [MASK]. Believe me, this was not entirely an accident; in my opinion these individuals stood out in the childlike minds of the Polynesians as more distinct than other American nationals.
<name>she</name>	she	Catharine	There is one thing about her I did not know until after we were engaged. For several years [MASK] has been collecting butter knives, and she now has one of the best collections in the country. That is quite remarkable, isn’t it ?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Apley	Everyone must be encouraged in small forms of thrift for giving. Yet in spite of the financial and physical strain under which he was laboring, there is a spirit of elation in [MASK]’s letters at this period born naturally from a sense of vindication.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	George	I am glad to hear from you that [MASK] seems to be pursuing his studies and seems to be tranquil. Let us both hope that this one escapade of his will be the only one to mar his life and that it is now a thing of the past.
<name>Mr. Brook</name>	Mr. Brook	Hobson	It may be well to give a brief description of [MASK]’s School, for it is an institution which I regret to say is passing. I regret, because it had so many of the essentials of high thought and plain living.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Catharine	Besides, you know it’s unsound; it isn’t going to help you with the people you like and who like you. Make your horse jump over the mud, don’t try to gallop him through it and don’t you mind what [MASK] says either. ...
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Apley	The consequence obviously foreshadowed a rift within the family and explains the reason for many breaches which are yet unhealed. At the time [MASK] was considerably surprised and not a little hurt by the unsympathetic, if not actually hostile, reactions of his own blood relations.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	El	It made me feel a little strange, because he did not seem to belong there. “I have forgotten how the old place looked,” he said. “[MASK], we have to get out of this before it gets us too.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Jane	A letter to his sis- ter [MASK], of the same date, reveals an undercurrent of deep unhappiness:— I wish I were more in the mood to enjoy the sights around me, but they seem to pass by me like shadows of a dream.
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Eleanor	I try to think that there is, even though I instinctively shy away from most of it. . . . Dear ]ohn:— At a small dinner last night, which your mother and I gave for [MASK], your sister suddenly began discussing psychology.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Eleanor	You are not really fitted to cope with the place, and surely you can’t like it. You face a foreign philosophy down there, but I suppose one is venturesome when one is young. Your mother and [MASK] are both well.
