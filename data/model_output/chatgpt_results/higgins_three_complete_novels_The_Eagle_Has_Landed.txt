<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Steiner	“Not long now.” He passed him a cigarette. “Thanks very much,” [MASK] said. “Just what I needed.” It was cold on the beach and the tide was about two-thirds of the way in.
<name>Pisces</name>	Pisces	Pisces	“February what?” “The twenty-second.” “Ah, a little fish, is it? [MASK]. We should do well together, me being a Scorpio. You should never marry a Virgo, by the way.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Pamela	“What’s it mean?” [MASK] hushed her again. “Quick, in here,” she said and opened the sacristy door. They slipped inside, she closed it and slid home the bolt. A moment later they heard voices clearly.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Steiner	It means, of course, that if we make contact in the vicinity of the Grange, I’ll be able to give you a very exact description of the immediate situation there.” “Excellent,” [MASK] said. “The whole thing seems more plausible by the minute.”
<name>Tarot</name>	Tarot	Kurt	She turned the seventh card over quickly, long enough to glance at it herself and put it back on top of the pack. “Lucky in cards as well, it seems, [MASK]. You drew Strength. Considerable good fortune, a triumph in adversity, sudden success.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Devlin	One eye was still completely closed, his lips scabbed and swollen. His entire face seemed lopsided and was covered with purple and green bruises. He stared at [MASK] dully, then put down his half-finished pint of ale and shuffled out.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Steiner	[MASK] turned and found the lieutenant holding an MP-40 machine pistol. The rest of his men were ranged behind him, all armed to the teeth. At that point, anything might have happened, had it not been for a sudden disturbance in the main entrance.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rossman	The passage at the bottom was brilliantly lit, brickwork painted white, doors opening to right and left. It was extraordinarily quiet. ‘‘Might as well start in here,” [MASK] said and opened the nearest door and switched on the light.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Gericke	He stood looking out across the airfield to the sea. “Too tough for you?” “Don’t be stupid,” [MASK] told him angrily. “I just like to know what I’m getting into, that’s all.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sturm	She was screaming as [MASK]’s hand fastened on her coat. He pulled her into his arms and tried to stand. But he went right under and when he surfaced again, he felt himself being drawn inexorably into the path of the water wheel.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Rogan	[MASK] stared at him. “That is interesting. The statutory IRA punishment when someone tries to cross you.” He cursed as the match in his left hand burned down to his fingers and dropped it. “What was his name, this Irishman?”
<name>Horatio</name>	Horatio	Steiner	The E-boat waited at the lower jetty. When they went down the steps they found [MASK] in sea boots and reefer jacket, leaning on the rail talking to a young bearded naval lieutenant in heavy sweater and salt-stained cap. He turned to greet them.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Steiner	‘‘Let’s move a little closer,” [MASK] whispered. They got to the boundary wall between the wood and the road and peered over. It was raining hard now. There were two jeeps, one on either side of the road and several Rangers were sheltering under the trees.
<name>Geneva</name>	Geneva	Vereker	The other was a legitimate ruse de guerre." “And a direct contravention of the Geneva Convention,” [MASK] answered. “Which not only expressly forbids the wearing of an enemy’s uniform in time of war, but also prescribes the death penalty for offenders.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Steiner	“Has it been worth it? Any of it?” “Oh, no.” [MASK] laughed lightly. “No more philosophy, please.” He held out his hand. “May you find what you are searching for, my friend.”
<name>Aziz</name>	Aziz	Steiner	“Not at all. He speaks really very good English. Most of the others manage Hello or Will you come out with me tonight and that’s it. They don’t seem to think they need any more.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>the boat</name>	the boat	Koenig	Beyond the line of sand dunes the land was flat and bare, swept clean by the constant wind. In the distance he could see the farmhouse and the hangars at the airstrip, black against a pale horizon. The wind brushed across the water and [MASK] reduced speed as they approached the inlet.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Shafto	You’re right, of course.” ‘‘Okay, sir, what do we do?” [MASK] looked at his watch. ‘‘Four-fifteen. That means the Prime Minister must be getting close. We know the road he’s coming on.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Devlin	“A weakness of mine,” [MASK] told her, aware of her concern and momentarily serious. “After periods of intense stress I sometimes keel over, go out like a light. Some psychological thing.” “What’s that?” she demanded, puzzled.
<name>Kurt</name>	Kurt	Gericke	He’s somebody for the first time in his life, that means a lot when you’ve been nothing. As regards the rest—well, he’s here as the result of a direct order from Himmler himself.” ‘‘What about you?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Radi	He opened the briefcase and started to extract the contents. “I’ll send for you when I need you.” [MASK] almost raised his arm, but one last stubborn grain of self-respect turned it into a smart, if conventional salute.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Koenig	[MASK] peered out of the window. “Another fifteen minutes before it breaks. We’ll be well up by then.” Thunder rumbled ominously, the sky darkened and the crew, waiting on deck for the first glimpse of their destination, were strangely quiet.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Altmann	Ach wie nichtig, ach wie fluchtig. O how cheating, O how fleeting are our days departing. . . One of the clerestory windows high up in the nave smashed. A burst of automatic fire knocked [MASK] off the seat into the choir stalls.
<name>Swiss</name>	Swiss	Devlin	Fifteen now, in spite of a lot of lucky breaks. What can you and this Gestapo shit offer that’s worse than that?” “Don’t go including me in this thing,” [MASK] said. “I’m neutral.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Teusen	It was [MASK] who caught sight of the light to port and ran to the bridge instantly. Three minutes later, the E-boat slid out of the darkness and someone shone a torch down on the two men.
<name>He</name>	He	Preston	When you jump at four hundred feet there isn’t really time to be frightened. [MASK] was aware of himself somersaulting, the sudden jerk, the slap of the ’chute catching air and then he was swinging beneath the dark khaki umbrella. It was fantastic.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Hofer	Forgive me, but as an old friend of the lady ...” He withdrew. A moment or so after he had gone, [MASK] came in from the anteroom carrying several files and a couple of rolled-up maps under his arm.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Radi	[MASK] said, “You think you are German soldiers, a natural error in view of the uniforms you wear, but you are mistaken.” He moved from one man to another, pausing as if committing each face to memory. “Shall I tell you what you are?”
<name>boy</name>	boy	Devlin	“There you are, boy, just like I promised.” He went across to the jeep and put the bottles down on the passenger seat. “Everything went off all right last night, then?” “No problems at all,” [MASK] said.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Devlin	Come now, for a man like you that must be rather like being a thoroughbred racing horse that finds itself pulling a milk cart.’’ [MASK] threw back his head and laughed out loud. “Ah, Colonel, you’ve found my weak spot instantly.
<name>The man</name>	The man	Garvald	I’m not likely to find the military police on my tail, now am I?” “Would I do that to you, son?” [MASK] beamed. “I ask you.” He banged the side of the track with the flat of his hand.
<name>Wick</name>	Wick	Steiner	The wind howled across the airstrip, driving rain before it, and he shivered. “What a bloody awful place.” “It serves its purpose.” “And what’s that?” [MASK] grinned. “You ask me that at least five times a day.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Liam	“[MASK], you won’t stand a chance.” She caught hold of him by the arm. “Oh, but I must, my pet.” He kissed her on the mouth and pushed her firmly to one side. He turned at the door.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Sturm	He moved from one man to another, pausing as if committing each face to memory. “Shall I tell you what you are?” Which he did in simple and direct terms that made [MASK] look like a beginner.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Himmler	[MASK] nodded and then, as if dismissing the subject completely, rubbed his hands together and leaned over the map. “The Grey woman’s reports are really quite brilliant. An outstanding agent.” He leaned down, eyes very close to the map.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Intelligence	The audiences loved it.” “And [MASK] pulled him in?” “On special occasions. If you intend to send the Prime Minister to sea at the height of the U-boat peril, it’s useful to have him publicly appearing elsewhere.”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Hofer	During the past year used as a training establishment for commando-type units on four occasions. Twice by British commandos, once by a similar unit composed of Poles and Czechs with English officers and once by American Rangers.” He passed the report across and [MASK] looked at it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Devlin	“All you have to do is live right. Better get back to your lads and make sure they’re ready to go. If everything works, we should pick up [MASK] on the S-phone twenty miles out. I’ll call you when we do.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Devlin	“Just what I needed.” It was cold on the beach and the tide was about two-thirds of the way in. [MASK] walked up and down restlessly to keep warm, holding the receiver in his right hand, the channel open.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Radi	[MASK] looked up at the ceiling again, thinking hard, trying to compress his thoughts. “Very interested in your visitor of sixth November. Like to drop some friends in to meet him in the hope that they might persuade him to come back with them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Gericke	As [MASK] opened the door and got out, rain drifted in off the sea in a fine spray and there was the tang of salt to it. He walked across to the edge of the crumbling runway and kicked with his foot until a piece of concrete broke away.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Thomas	The jeep which had just been shot-up pulled in at the side of the road in front of number three. Its driver had a bad cut on the face. A sergeant named [MASK] was putting a field dressing on it.
<name>Paddy</name>	Paddy	Molly	You just happened.” “You bloody traitor!” He said in a kind of exasperation, “[MASK], I’m Irish, that means I’m as different from you as a German is from a Frenchman. I’m a foreigner. ✓ 242 -*>&-
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Seymour	Always helped out by a little dirty work now and then, of course.” He kicked [MASK] under the right kneecap and as the big man doubled over in agony, put a knee into the descending face, lifting him back through the door into the mud of the yard.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rogan	Gangrene as the result of a gunshot wound. The hospital got their hands on him too late.” [MASK] struck a match. “There are people I know who might say that was the best bit of news they’d heard in years but how does it affect us?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Brandt	[MASK] said grimly. “And he has someone with him who looks like a civilian, but isn’t.” “Gestapo?” “So it would appear. They’re on their way down now—walking.”
<name>James</name>	James	Devlin	“Couldn’t be more helpful. [MASK] was right. I think he’s decided we’re here to keep an eye on the great man.” “What happens now?” “You’ll see us playing soldiers round the village.
<name>he</name>	he	Himmler	You know their record. Can you see such a man fitting in? Taking orders?” “He will do as he is told,” [MASK] said. “That goes without question. We’ll have him in, shall we?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Preston	You’ll therefore be indistinguishable from the rest of your comrades with whom you will be training. Naturally there will be certain additional work necessary in your case, but we’ll come to that later. Any questions?” [MASK]’s eyes burned, he could hardly breathe so great was his rage.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Steiner	There were more Rangers behind the hedge on his left and he tossed the second grenade over towards them as the first exploded. He kept right on going, down the road past the mill and round the comer, skidding to a halt behind the bridge where [MASK] still crouched with the machine-gun.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Steiner	“The obvious thing to do since a further outbreak of hostilities seems imminent.” [MASK] looked faintly amused. “Why, did you think we’d hold the entire village hostage or come out fighting, driving the women in front of us?
<name>them</name>	them	Radi	“Fair enough. Let [MASK] know about it in your next broadcast and there’s your duty done. And now, I must get on.” She turned to go to the car and hesitated. “I don’t like the sound of this man Garvald.”
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Devlin	[MASK] was across the yard in a moment, scrambled up into the high seat behind the wheel and rammed the stick into gear, accelerating so savagely that the tractor shot forward, trailer swaying, turnips scattering across the yard like cannon balls.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Vereker	Your people, by the way, have nothing to fear as long as they do as they are told.” “You won’t get away with it,” [MASK] said stubbornly. “Oh, I don’t know. It’s been done before.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Max	There was understanding on the Admiral’s face now and he looked again at the paper. After a while he smiled. “Yes, very good, [MASK]. Quite absurd, of course, but on paper it does have a kind of mad logic to it.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Steiner	“Only if we have to,” [MASK] said. “I’d much prefer to keep him in one piece.” “And now the planning’s gone slightly awry? The best laid schemes and so on ... ”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Seymour	“A pint of brown ale would suit me fine.” [MASK] drained his flagon and banged it down on the table. “I buys my own.” He picked up the shotgun and hefted it in one hand.
<name>Major</name>	Major	Krukowski	“[MASK] jumped out of the bushes at the wrong moment.” Major, she thought, surprised at his youth. She scrambled to her feet. “I’m all right, really I am.” She swayed and the major took her arm.
<name>The captain</name>	The captain	Steiner	“Let me go!” he said faintly. “Cut me loose. You’ll make it on your own.” [MASK] didn’t bother to reply at first, but concentrated on turning the torpedo over towards the right.
<name>she</name>	she	Devlin	“He probably has men out there, too. This way he covers the road as well.” “It doesn’t matter,” [MASK] said. “We can cross the road further down. Make it to the beach on foot as you said.”
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Steiner	Considerable good fortune, a triumph in adversity, sudden success.” She smiled brightly. “And now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I’ll see to the coffee,” and she walked out of the room. [MASK] reached down and turned the card over.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Steiner	And then as the implication struck home, he started to laugh. “And here was I worrying like hell about who I was going to have to work with.” He scrambled up the ladder and grabbed [MASK]’s hand.
<name>General</name>	General	Himmler	“My God,” [MASK] said, “and still we continue to lose the war.” He got up, walked to the fire and warmed his hands. “This whole question of wearing enemy uniform is a matter of great delicacy and it is forbidden under the Geneva Convention.
<name>Lazarus</name>	Lazarus	Gascoigne	I knelt over the tombstone and tried to get my fingers to it, which proved to be rather difficult. But then, quite suddenly, it started to move. “Come on, [MASK],” I said softly. “Let’s be having you.”
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Shafto	[MASK] hadn’t bothered swopping to a tin hat and still wore his sidecap. He took a cigar from one of his shirt pockets, and put it between his teeth purely for effect. He took his time over lighting it, then got out of the jeep and came forward.
<name>Major</name>	Major	Steiner	They left the Bedford outside with a man on guard, but took the jeep inside. [MASK] stood in it and addressed them all. “So far, so good. From now on we’ve got to make the whole thing look as natural as possible.
<name>he</name>	he	Steiner	So one very obvious avenue was closed to me. If [MASK], whoever he was, had been buried here, then he should have gone into the register. That was an incontrovertible point of English law. So what in the hell did it all mean?
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Devlin	“That looks all right to me. Okay, you’re on. What about another snort?” “No, thanks,” [MASK] said. “I’ve places to go.” He pulled on the wet trenchcoat and buttoned it quickly.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Steiner	Funny people. Maybe we can have some sort of get together.” “I’m afraid not,” [MASK] said. “I’m under special orders. Exercises this afternoon and this evening, move on to join up with other units under my command tomorrow.
<name>Drake</name>	Drake	Devlin	[MASK] could have told her that the Spanish Armada had been so described, but remembering what had happened to that ill-fated venture decided, once again, to keep his mouth shut. “To the English Enterprise,” he said solemnly. “Good.”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Radi	[MASK] had paid his fee and taken the pills—three different kinds— which with any kind of luck might keep him going. As long as he could stay out of the hands of the Army medics he had a chance, but one more physical check-up with that lot
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Vereker	[MASK] managed one of his rare smiles. “What can I do for you?” “Put us up for the night, if you will. You’ve a bam in the field next door that’s had similar use before, I believe.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Gericke	“No difficulty at all if you go in below six hundred feet. Naturally I’ll have the plane cleaned up and the RAF rondels replaced on the wings. If anyone does see you, they see an RAF aircraft presumably going about its lawful business.” “But why?” said [MASK].
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Ritter	“You, not me. There are Rangers down there on the road. I thought I might arrange a small diversion while you get across. I’ll catch up with you later.” [MASK] grabbed his arm and there was panic in his voice.
<name>he</name>	he	Armsby	The truth is that the implications, if what [MASK] had said was true, were so enormous that for the moment, my mind was incapable of handling the idea. It was there. I was aware of its existence, but didn’t consciously think about it.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Werner	A Ranger pitched headlong through the window and landed between two pews. In the same moment, several more clerestory windows crashed in and heavy fire was poured down into the church. [MASK] was hit in the head as he ran along the south aisle and fell on his face without a cry.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ben	“What’s got into you, [MASK]? I don’t understand. You let a little Mick, so fresh out of the bogs he’s still got mud on his boots, walk all over you. You took more from him than I’ve seen you take from anyone.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arthur	‘‘Oh, I see now. And [MASK]—was he there?” ‘‘You could say that. I get the impression he looks upon you as his personal property.” ‘‘Then he can go to hell,” she said, suddenly fierce.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Gericke	[MASK] kept her going, straight into that gray wall, refusing to sacrifice power for height, hanging on till the last possible moment, before pulling the column right back. At five hundred feet they burst out of the fog, he stamped on the right rudder and turned out to sea.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Kane	[MASK] stood in the back behind a Browning anti-aircraft machine-gun and was already firing up through the wood floor above, the enormous .50 calibre rounds smashing their way through with ease, ripping the planking to pieces.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Garvey	Maybe some notion he had about security. He sure was anxious to get to grips with those paratroopers.” A jeep turned out of the main gate and moved towards them. [MASK] was at the wheel and when he braked, his face was serious.
<name>him</name>	him	Susan	When the boy has changed, take [MASK] in to her grandparents. They run the Post Office and general store, is this not so?” She glanced wildly at her husband, still bemused by the whole thing. “Yes, that’s right.”
<name>her</name>	her	Molly	He wasn’t worried about his threats in the slightest, but then he thought of [MASK] and his stomach went hollow. “My God,” he said softly. “If he harms her, I’ll kill the bastard. I’ll kill him.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Steiner	“Damn you, [MASK], go to hell your own way,” he said wearily. He unslung his Sten gun, took off the trenchcoat and handed it over. “You’ll find a silenced Mauser in the right-hand pocket and two extra magazines.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Muller	The sky seemed to split wide open and rain began to fall in torrents. As they coasted in towards the concrete pier, a field car appeared on the track between the dunes. [MASK] cut the engines and leaned out of the window shouting orders.
<name>Green</name>	Green	Devlin	You know all about that?” “Yes, sir.” “Anything you want to ask me?” “The gun, sir,” [MASK] said. “I understand you want me to do a little shooting.” “Ah, yes.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Mallory	“I haven’t the slightest idea,” [MASK] said. “I get the orders, I follow them through. He wants you in a hurry, I know that.” He grinned. “Maybe it’s the Second Front.”
<name>Butch</name>	Butch	Steiner	“There are American Rangers there. A crack outfit. They’d show [MASK] and his bunch a thing or two. How did you get here?” “Horseback. He’s tied up in the woods behind the presbytery.” “All right, leave him.
<name>Lassie</name>	Lassie	Patch	As she finished, the dog brought her a stick to throw, which he laid carefully down between her feet. She crouched and fondled his ears. “Yes, [MASK],” she said softly. “I really think this will do very well indeed.”
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Steiner	Simply took her straight up to a thousand feet, banked to starboard and dropped down towards the coast. Inside, [MASK] and his men made ready. They were all dressed in full British paratroop gear, all weapons and equipment stowed in suspension bags in the British manner.
<name>James Bond</name>	James Bond	Preston	Unlimited booze and as many women as you can handle, if you’re not too choosy, that is. Now it’s all got to be paid for.” At an inch above six feet, [MASK] was able to look down with some contempt at the Irishman.
<name>Miller</name>	Miller	Werner	[MASK] turned, crouching, firing his Sten. A Ranger pitched headlong through the window and landed between two pews. In the same moment, several more clerestory windows crashed in and heavy fire was poured down into the church.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Radi	“Now, a few facts. I would like you to elaborate on this question of disguise that you mention in your outline. That interests me.” [MASK] was aware of a feeling of total unreality. No one was safe—no one.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Joanna	“Of course not. You did tell me in confidence, remember.” “Shouldn’t have mentioned it at all actually, but then I knew I could trust you, [MASK].” He slipped an arm about her waist.
<name>Anderson</name>	Anderson	Rogan	“And now he’s back,” [MASK] said. “But what for, that’s the thing. Have you heard from any of the provincial forces yet?” “Seven, sir—all negative, I’m afraid.” “All right.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pamela	The shock of a gunshot wound is so great that it numbs the entire central nervous system for a while. There was a desperate air of unreality to everything as [MASK] stumbled upstairs to the kitchen. She leaned on a chest of drawers to stop herself from falling, and looked in the mirror above it.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Pamela	Another shouted order echoed faintly from the village. “Are they still at it out there?” [MASK] asked. “Wouldn’t you think there was enough war to get on with and still they have to play their stupid games. Is my brother down there?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Garvald	[MASK] turned on a large, hefty young man in a sheepskin flying jacket who leaned against the truck reading a newspaper. “You get me some heat in here tomorrow night, Sammy boy, or I’ll have your balls. Understand?”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Molly	[MASK] cursed softly, eased the dress over her head, splitting a seam under one arm, and pulled on her Sunday shoes with the two-inch heels. As she went downstairs she ran a comb through her hair, wincing as it snagged on the tangles.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Koenig	“Another fifteen minutes before it breaks. We’ll be well up by then.” Thunder rumbled ominously, the sky darkened and the crew, waiting on deck for the first glimpse of their destination, were strangely quiet. [MASK] said, “I don’t blame them.
