<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Mal’akh	This phone had served [MASK] well. . . but now it was time it became untraceable. He climbed behind the wheel, put the car in gear, and crept forward until he heard the sharp crack of the iPhone imploding.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mal’akh	reorganized . . . and although [MASK] could not grasp the meaning of the entire message, he understood enough . . . enough to know exactly where he was now headed. The pyramid points the way. The grid pointed to one of the world’s great mystical locations.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	“Professor, did you notice the engraving on the ring’s band? It bears the words ‘All is revealed at the thirty-third degree.’ ” [MASK] nodded. “It’s a common theme in Masonic lore.”
<name>Yggdrasil</name>	Yggdrasil	Sephiroth	“You’re saying the early mystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?” “Absolutely.” He motioned to the page’s illustration of ten intertwined circles called [MASK]. “Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is very advanced.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Katherine	Your brother told me you were aware of his visits to me, but now I see that’s not the case.” My brother lied to his doctor? [MASK]’s concern was now growing steadily. “Is he sick?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Langdon	“Any moment now.” Then the line went dead. [MASK] stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened. Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound. It was coming from the Rotunda. Someone was screaming.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	"The circumpunct,” [MASK] said, “we already know has many meanings—one of its most esoteric being the rose, the alchemical symbol for perfection. But, when you place a rose on the center of a cross, you create another symbol entirely—the Rose Cross.”
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Andros	[MASK] felt younger every day. He continued to read day and night—ancient mystical texts, epic medieval poems, the early philosophers—and the more he learned about the true nature of things, the more he realized that all hope for mankind was lost.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Katherine	Painfully, he swept an arm to one side, pushing the leather bag out of the way to clear his sight line into the dining room. To his horror, he saw that [MASK] had been tied up, and a large rag had been stuffed deep into her mouth.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	The shrill sound of [MASK]’s cell phone cut the air. He pulled his phone from his jacket. Uncertain, he answered. “Hello?” The voice that spoke was an eerie, familiar whisper. “Professor, I hear you had unexpected company.”
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Langdon	What do you want from me?” “What do I want from you?” The OS director’s grating voice crackled through [MASK]’s phone, scraping and hollow, like that of a dying man with strep throat.
<name>Kira</name>	Kira	Katherine	Is it even operable? [MASK] fumbled blindly in the blackness, searching the bay door until she found the large metal handle. Grasping it, she threw her weight backward, trying to slide open the door. Nothing. She tried again. It didn’t budge.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Simkins	Nonetheless, [MASK] remained confident. There was absolutely no place to hide on a subway car. No bathrooms, no storage, and no alternative exits. Even if the targets had seen them board the train and fled to the back, there was no way out.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Katherine	"Thanks. Has my brother arrived yet?” “No, ma’am, not yet.” "Thank you.” As [MASK] hung up, she felt an unexpected twinge of trepidation. The uneasy feeling made her pause, but only for a moment.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sato	“You okay?” He glanced up, an odd look on his face. “Did you see this?” He pointed at the living-room floor. [MASK] came over and looked down at the plush carpet. She shook her head, seeing nothing.
<name>Lucian</name>	Lucian	Mal’akh	The area’s sole entrance was a steep ramp secretly accessible through his living room, making the area’s discovery virtually impossible. Tonight, as [MASK] descended the ramp, the tattooed sigils and signs on his flesh seemed to come alive in the cerulean glow of his basement’s specialized lighting.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	As [MASK]’s eidetic memory skimmed through his mental encyclopedia of symbols, he could find only one possible point to make. It was something that had occurred to him initially, but had seemed unlikely. At the moment, however, he had to buy time to think.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mal’akh	I need to prepare quickly. He glanced over at the dead CIA agent in the foyer. This home is no longer safe. Carrying the stone pyramid in one hand, [MASK] strode directly to his first-floor study and sat down at his laptop computer.
<name>Rapp</name>	Rapp	Sato	The driveway gate was closed, and the house was dark and quiet. [MASK] gave the signal to touch down. The aircraft landed hard on the front lawn amid several other vehicles . . . one of them a security sedan with a bubble light on top.
<name>Mal'akh</name>	Mal'akh	Peter	This pyramid has been targeted in the past, even by those who infiltrated our brotherhood with unworthy motives. [MASK]’s choice to store it outside the brotherhood was a clever one.” “Were you aware I had the capstone?”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Solomon	"Exactly!” [MASK] replied, grinning now with excitement. “Due south! On a map, down is south. Moreover, on a map, the word Heredom would not be a metaphor for heaven, it would be the name of a geographic location.”
<name>Coriolanus</name>	Coriolanus	Langdon	It was a long time ago, but it’s written and initialed by the Architect himself.” The term Architect, [MASK] knew, was not a reference to the man who had designed the Capitol, but rather to the man who ran it.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Katherine	Her vision started to tunnel. Behind her, the tattooed man closed the room’s lone door and flipped on the light. [MASK]’s eyes were watering profusely now, and she could no longer differentiate objects in her immediate surroundings. Everything had become a blur.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Langdon	Destructive thoughts have influence, too, and we all know it’s far easier to destroy than it is to create.” [MASK] thought of all the lore about needing to protect the ancient wisdom from the unworthy and share it only with the enlightened.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Langdon	Are you saying this pyramid can undergo a literal physical transformation?” “Professor, if I were to reach out with my hand and transform this pyramid right before your eyes, would you believe what you bad witnessed?” [MASK] had no idea how to respond.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nunez	As he headed back across the expansive marble floors, he thought of the man in the army-surplus jacket with the tattoos. I let him in. [MASK] wondered if he would have a job tomorrow. As he headed toward the escalator, a sudden pounding on the outside doors caused him to turn.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Mal’akh	The secret is how to die. [MASK] knew it had all gone wrong. There was no brilliant light. No wondrous reception. Only darkness and excruciating pain. Even in his eyes. He could see nothing, and yet he sensed movement all around him.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Nola	“A lot of this code has yet to be deciphered, and there are plenty of people who think the message might actually relate to ancient Masonic secrets.” [MASK] now recalled murmurs of a Masonic/Kryptos link, but she tended to ignore the lunatic fringe.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Robert	“My God!” She wheeled back to the tattooed animal before her. “What have you done with [MASK]?!” “Shh,” the man whispered. “Or he’ll hear you.” He stepped to one side and motioned behind him.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Peter	Winding up from the man’s white loincloth, an elegant spiral staircase ascended the middle of his muscular back. Each stair was positioned on a different vertebra. Speechless, [MASK] let his eyes ascend the staircase, all the way up to the base of the man’s skull.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mal’akh	The message could not have been more clear. Beneath the House of the Temple. Heredom^ The Lost Word is here . . . somewhere. Although [MASK] did not know precisely how to locate it, he was confident that the answer lay in the remaining symbols on the grid.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Bellamy	I run this place! [MASK] now realized it was his own key fob that was giving them access. Powerful arms pushed him through the doorway, leading him down a familiar, winding walkway. The heavy, damp warmth of this place usually felt comforting to him.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	The Masonic Pyramid is one of D.C.’s most enduring myths, probably stemming from the pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States.” “Why didn’t you mention it earlier?” [MASK] shrugged. “Because it has no basis in fact.
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Katherine	including your brother’s life.” [MASK]’s pretty features hardened, and she tucked a wisp of hair behind her ears. When she spoke, her voice was resolved. “This stone pyra- mid; whatever it is, has cost me my entire family.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Katherine	She could sense a presence, only a few feet in front of her on the carpet. In the silence, the pounding of [MASK]’s heart seemed loud enough to give her away. Silently, she stepped out of her shoes and inched to her left, sidestepping off the carpet.
<name>Abagnale</name>	Abagnale	Peter	“Decipher the engraving,” the voice continued, “and it will tell you the hiding place of mankind’s greatest treasure.” He laughed. "[MASK] did not entrust you with the treasure itself, Professor.”
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Peter	. when I am released from this mortal shell . . . when I have offered up this beautiful body to the gods in sacrifice. I am the precious one1. I am the pure white lamb1” [MASK]’s mouth fell open but no words came out.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Bellamy	The OS director’s secure laptop provided her with worldwide access to CIA computer systems via encrypted satellite uplinks. Earlier tonight, she had used this computer to share with [MASK] some kind of information that had stunned the man into cooperating fully.
<name>Harrison</name>	Harrison	Sato	The infamous interrogation technique of water boarding was highly effective because the victim truly believed he was drowning. [MASK] knew of several classified operations in which sensory-deprivation tanks like these had been used to enhance that illusion to terrifying new levels.
<name>Lara</name>	Lara	Sato	“He said he had deciphered the grid on the bottom of the pyramid, and that the pyramid told him to go to the sacred mountain.” “Professor,” [MASK] pressed, "does that mean anything to you?”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	[MASK] turned. "Why would you assume that?” “Because you were brought here, Professor. You were chosen. This inscription appears to be a code of some sort, and considering your reputation, it seems obvious to me that you were brought here to decipher it.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Sato	He said he wouldn't be here for at least twenty minutes. On [MASK]’s command, the pilot performed a “touch-hover” on the roof of the tallest building around—the renowned One Franklin Square—a towering and prestigious office building with two gold spires on top.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Trish	Her voice sounded anxious, out of breath. “Ma’am, your brother has not yet—” "Where’s [MASK]?!” she demanded. “Can you see her on the monitors?” The guard rolled his chair over to look at the screens.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Bellamy	Believe me, he is a walking time bomb . . . capable of initiating a series of events that will profoundly change the world as you know it.” “I don’t understand.” [MASK] shifted on the bench, his arms aching in his handcuffs.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	The seven symbols are a transliteration1 The simplest of ciphers. The symbols are letters. The stonemason’s square—L The element gold—AU The Greek Sigma—S The Greek Delta—D Alchemical mercury—E The Ouroboros—O “Laus Deo," [MASK] whispered.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Sato	“I recognize his ring . . . and his hand.” He paused. “The tattoos are new, though. Someone did that to him recently.” “I’m sorry?” [MASK] looked unnerved for the first time since arriving.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	Sato	Is [MASK] a member of Eastern Star? The Order of the Eastern Star—often considered a sister organization to the Masons— embraced a similar mystical philosophy of benevolence, secret wisdom, and spiritual open-mindedness. The same team? I'm in handcuffs1
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	“Director," [MASK] replied instantly, “this little pyramid is not the Masonic Pyramid.” “So it is merely coincidence that we found a pyramid hidden at the heart of the U.S. Capitol in a secret chamber belonging to a Masonic leader?”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	Besides, you’ve already told me you’d prefer not to join.” This was true. [MASK] had great respect for Masonic philosophy and symbolism, and yet he had decided never to be initiated; the order’s vows of secrecy would prevent him from discussing Freemasonry with his students.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Anderson	“I want you to find him for me immediately.” That’s all? You want me to page someone? [MASK] felt suddenly hopeful that maybe the timing of this call was pure coincidence. “Who are you looking for?”
<name>She</name>	She	Sato	“Not at all.” Still, he felt a surge of hope. “But if he got the information off the bottom of the pyramid, we can get it, too.” I told him how to solve it. [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Mal’akh	the group intoned. Yes, [MASK] thought. As above, so below. “ . . . And lead us not into temptation . . .” Help us master the weakness of our flesh. “. . . Deliver us from evil. . .”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mal’akh	The lantern ... to represent the feeble light of human understanding. And the key ... to represent the missing piece, that which tonight I shall at last possess. [MASK] completed his blood tracing and held up the vellum, admiring his work in the light of the three candles.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Peter	. until the video is public .. . until you must live the rest of your life knowing you could have stopped these tragedies. Time is running out. You know what must be done.” [MASK]’s heart ached.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Peter	“Ancient Mysteries, science, and the Holy Scriptures?” “Bingo.” “Welcome to my world.” She winked. “[MASK] initiated me into this long ago. It fueled a lot of my research.” “Intuitively, some of what he said made sense.”
<name>Mal'akh</name>	Mal'akh	Langdon	On the coffee table before them, [MASK]’s leather bag was still open, the golden capstone peeking out the top. The words Eight Franklin Square had now faded away, leaving no evidence that they had ever existed.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sato	[MASK] demanded. “Confidence is high,” the man said, emotionless. “Backup just arrived. All library exits are surrounded. We even have air support coming in. We’ll flush him with tear gas, and he’ll have nowhere to run.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Langdon	In this strange, dark place, trapped underwater, [MASK] strained to comprehend that these would be his final moments of life. Soon he would cease to exist. . . everything he was ... or had ever been ... or would ever be . . . was ending.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Zachary	“Who are you?! How did you get in here?!” “I knew your little boy, [MASK], in prison. He told me where this key was hidden.” The stranger held up an old key and grinned like a beast. "
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mal’akh	The professor was out cold and would be for a while. [MASK]’s eyes moved with trepidation now to the stone pyramid on the floor beside the professor’s open bag. His breath caught, and his heart pounded. I have waited for years . . .
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Mal’akh	The ancient texts are clear, though. Only by offering what is most sacred can man access the ultimate power.” “You consider me a sacred offering?” [MASK] now laughed out loud. “You really don’t understand yet, do you?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Trish	Five seconds later, he was still staring longingly through the window. “Okay, okay,” [MASK] finally said, laughing as she inserted her key card and typed her PIN number. “Come on. I’ll show you the squid.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Katherine	A slamming door drew [MASK]’s attention, and suddenly she was back in the basement, lying on a cold stone table. The metal door at the top of the ramp had closed loudly, and the tattooed man was coming back down.
<name>Masaru</name>	Masaru	Katherine	[MASK]’s experiments demonstrated the effect of human thought on everything from ice crystals to random-event generators to the movement of subatomic particles. The results were conclusive and irrefutable, with the potential to transform skeptics into believers and affect global consciousness on a massive scale.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Katherine	“Flanks converge!” [MASK] apparently had heard all she needed to hear. She climbed onto the conveyor belt with her head only a few feet from the opening in the wall. She crossed her hands over her chest like a mummy in a sarcophagus.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Katherine	he stammered, blinking his gray eyes as if to make sure he was not dreaming. “I think you just weighed the human soul.” There was a long silence between them. [MASK] sensed that her brother was attempting to process all the stark and wondrous ramifications.
<name>Langford</name>	Langford	Zoubianis	“Believe me, I just pulled a redacted document off this server, and it was not military.” [MASK] pulled up his terminal window and tried a traceroute. “You said your traceroute died?” “Yeah. Twice. Same hop.”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Katherine	[MASK] stepped behind the desk and powered up the computer. When the machine finally came to life, she realized she had another problem. “There’s no icon for a browser.” “It’s an internal library network.”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	It was located in the lower left-hand corner and enclosed the letter S. [MASK] wrote down S. The next symbol on the pyramid was a dotted square missing its right side. That shape on the decryption grid enclosed the letter O. He wrote down O.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Mal’akh	Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain. [MASK] entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behind him. As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Sato	“No coverage of those coordinates tonight. Do you want to make a reposition request?” "No thanks. Too late.” She hung up. [MASK] exhaled, now having no idea how they would figure out where their target had gone.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	They reached the grand staircase to the main entrance, which was set back in an eighty-foot archway beneath a breathtaking rose window. As they began climbing, [MASK]’s mind shifted to the mysterious stranger who had called him. No names, please . . .
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	[MASK] jumped when he saw the carving. The medallion depicted a frightening cloaked figure holding a scythe and kneeling beside an hourglass. The figure’s arm was raised, and his index finger was extended, pointing directly at a large open Bible, as if to say: “The answer is in there!”
<name>Avonlea</name>	Avonlea	Masonry	“Times are different now. I understand that [MASK] probably appears strange to you, or maybe even boring. But I want you to know, that doorway will always be open for you should you change your mind.”
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Katherine	she whispered into the phone. The guard was typing frantically. “Yes, it looks like he entered . . . ninety seconds ago.” [MASK]’s body went rigid. She stopped breathing. The darkness felt suddenly alive all around her. He’s in here with me.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Nunez	“Is this true?’” [MASK] nodded vigorously, doing his best to play along. “I’m sorry, sir. The Architect told me not to tell a soul!” "I don’t give a damn what the Architect told you!”
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Katherine	[MASK] glanced over. “Empty? So why are we looking at it?” Her brother’s gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. “It occurred to me that because nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it.” “Me?”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	He’s pumping air in for me. He doesn't want me to suffocate. [MASK]’s relief was short-lived. A terrifying sound was now emanating up through the holes in the vent. It was the unmistakable gurgle of flowing liquid . . .
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Solomon	The prophecy of the Apocalypse is just one of the Bible’s beautiful messages that has been distorted.” [MASK] stepped to the front of the stage. “Believe me, the Apocalypse is coming . . . and it will be nothing like what we were taught."
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Trish	“Wouldn’t that tell you who owns the domain?” A bit lowbrow, but not a bad idea. [MASK] navigated to the “who is” database and ran a search for the IP, hoping to match the cryptic numbers to an actual domain name.
<name>Lara</name>	Lara	Trish	Her trace had stopped before reaching the document’s server. Her ping, for some reason, had hit a network device that swallowed it rather than bouncing it back. "It looks like my traceroute got blocked,” [MASK] said. Is that even possible?
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Katherine	Everything had become a blur. A distorted vision of colorful flesh appeared before her, and [MASK] felt her eyes starting to flutter as she teetered on the brink of unconsciousness. A scale-covered arm reached out and yanked the rag from her mouth.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Simkins	She shook her head, seeing nothing. “Crouch down,” [MASK] said. “Look at the nap of the carpet.” She did. After a moment, she saw it. The fibers of the carpet looked like they had been mashed down . . .
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	brilliantly. Not only had [MASK] reunited the pieces of the Masonic Pyramid, he had figured out how to solve the arcane grid of symbols on the base. At first glance, the symbols seemed indecipherable . . . and yet the answer was simple . . .
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Parrish	[MASK] walked over to the statue and ran his palm across the cryptic sea of letters. “A lot of this code has yet to be deciphered, and there are plenty of people who think the message might actually relate to ancient Masonic secrets.”
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Sato	I suggest you wait for me as long as it takes.” The line went dead. Instantly, the room sprang to life. [MASK] began shouting orders. Several field agents grabbed their radios and headed for the door. “Move! Move!”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Mal’akh	To this day, it remained this country’s greatest untold secret. Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory. Now they have opened their doors to me, [MASK] thought.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Sato	The lock mechanism was now in tatters, the wood surrounding it entirely pulverized. The lock had released, the door now having fallen ajar. [MASK] extended the pistol and pressed the tip of the barrel against the door, giving it a push.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Bellamy	[MASK] heard muffled voices talking. “Sorry . . . impossible . . .” an authoritative voice was saying. “ . . . closed at this hour . . .” The man driving the SUV replied with equal authority. “CIA investigation . . .
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sato	“Anything else?” “Actually, yes. The density scan picked up minor irregularities on the surface of the gold pyramid. It turns out the gold is engraved with text.” “Really?” [MASK] sounded hopeful. “What does it say?”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	“Whatever you believe this engraving reveals,” [MASK] said, “it won’t be the Ancient Mysteries.” “Of course not,” he replied. “The mysteries are far too vast to be written on the side of a little stone pyramid.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Mal’akh	“This is not the Lost Word.” Of course it is, [MASK] thought. You convinced me of that beyond a doubt. According to legend, the Lost Word was written in a language so ancient and arcane that mankind had all but forgotten how to read it.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	the secret is how to die.” I can't remember all the symbolsI [MASK] closed his eyes, doing his best to recall the precise locations of the symbols on the bottom of the stone pyramid, but even his eidetic memory did not have that degree of recall.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Langdon	“That’s it? We’re here.” [MASK] glanced up and saw the spinning lights of a security vehicle parked in a driveway up ahead. The driveway gate was pulled aside and the agent gunned the SUV inside the compound. The house was a spectacular mansion.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Sato	Her face looked almost demonic in the smoke-filled moonlight that streamed down through the glass ceiling overhead. “So then,” [MASK] continued, “when you arrived at the Capitol tonight, and you discovered that I was already there . . . you made a decision.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Katherine	Instead of rounding the corner, [MASK] suddenly cut hard to her left, away from the building, out onto the grass. As she did so, she closed her eyes tightly, placed both hands over her face, and began running totally blind across the lawn.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Professor	We would be wise to give this man a little respect.” “He cut off a man’s hand!” “My point exactly. That is hardly the act of an uncommitted or uncertain individual. More important, [MASK], this man obviously believes you can help him.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Sato	His key ring, she had noticed, included an electronic fob adorned with four letters—USBG. [MASK] knew, of course, which government building this fob accessed. The building was very close and, at this hour, very private. She smiled and pocketed the fob.
<name>Lucian</name>	Lucian	Mal’akh	With a steady hand, [MASK] touched the nib of the feather to his skin. He needed no mirror, no assistance, only his sense of touch, and his mind’s eye. Slowly, meticulously, he began inscribing the Lost Word inside the circular ouroboros on his scalp.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Langdon	I thought this was a map.” [MASK] looked equally perplexed, the excitement in his eyes evaporating. “This decryption obviously is correct, but. . “The man who has my brother wants to know a location." She tucked her hair behind her ear.
