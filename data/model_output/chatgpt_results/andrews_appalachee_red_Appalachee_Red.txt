<name>John</name>	John	Red	But so happy was she to be free of her room that she didn’t want to spoil the good feeling by questioning [MASK]’s actions; they in themselves were enough to make her a true believer in this man and all his doings.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Boots	But what had in the end lured most of those blacks who visited the polls on voting day was the sign just beneath each poster inside the cafe guaranteeing all those casting ballots for [MASK] and other candidates on his ticket the entire afternoon off from work, with pay, to do so . . .
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Darling	even if he, admittedly, wasn’t to the church members’. Thus, [MASK] continued faithfully attending the church of his choice . . . along with secretly using the skin bleach cream he had begun to send away for.
<name>her manager</name>	her manager	Red	after first upping the admission price by a quarter on the nights she decided to perform. But charge them, she told [MASK], she would not do, as she loved dancing much too much to think of doing such a thing!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clyde	In the meantime [MASK], with the aid of his flashlight and several black youngsters, groped about over the gravel on the street until all but one of the buttons ripped off his shirt by his assailant had been found.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Red	That was when [MASK] came up with the suggestion that he agree to relinquish the casino on Monday nights (normally a dead night) to these grumbling county leaders so they could gamble among themselves and thus feel a part of the scene and, perhaps, stop grumbling.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bird	The couple had fought all the night before over what they felt to be correct funeral dress. [MASK] had announced he was going to wear his black baseball warmup jacket—its color, he reasoned, being proper for the mournful occasion.
<name>John</name>	John	Darling	Following his graduation from high school, [MASK], to his regret, came back to the farm, where for nearly four years his grandfather, old age steadily creeping upon him, tried, but to no avail whatsoever, to teach the boy the ways of running a sixty-acre operation.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Boots	Then after [MASK] had come and gone, he would sit for another hour or so, hearing the music from her radio while keeping his ears perked to make sure no one else tried climbing the stairs to her room.
<name>anybody</name>	anybody	Toms	“Meaning that I’m not going to let you pay my way out of here, simply because I can’t be bought off from wiping this town’s ass by you, by that one-eyed murdering motherfucker sitting up front there, or by any other of the town’s crackers ... or [MASK]!”
<name>Sheriff</name>	Sheriff	Clyde	A hush would blanket the Alley once the blacks clustered back here on their big day in town would first hear the unmistakable sound of boots striking gravel, then look up to see the blue-clad figure of [MASK] swaggering down the middle of the narrow little street with that loose-jointed gait of his.
<name>Judas</name>	Judas	Lonzo	And that’s exactly how his knock had sounded. And without a word [MASK] had taken the man’s jug and brought it back filled with liquor he hadn’t wanted to sell before the next day, when the country crowd would be pouring into town.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	Then [MASK] had a sudden, cold feeling that it was very late and he started wondering, why wasn’t the big red nigger himself dead by now? And why was he here insisting upon going down to work in the cafe when it had closed hours ago?
<name>Harlem</name>	Harlem	Sam	Stopping outside the cafe, the group would pat their respective pockets in near-unison to reassure themselves that their blades were still with them before stomping up onto the porch and in through the front door of [MASK]’s, strutting straight for the right side of the room—the Hole Niggers’ turf.
<name>Sykes</name>	Sykes	Bird	“I jes’ wanna know wha’s goin’ on ’round heah. Lak, do you have de key to de upstals do’? Stuff lak dat. ” The casualness in the [MASK]’s voice had been abruptly replaced by a blade-king hardness.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Roxanne	This arrangement between wealthy white master and dead black servant [MASK] knew to be an old Southern custom, so her mother’s sharp reply had taken her by surprise. “She was your servant all that time, not mine!”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Darling	And the Sunday that this feeling of being an intruder collided with her psyche the girl immediately began understanding why. Looking around herself in church that day she took sharp notice of the fact for the first time that she and [MASK] were the only two really dark-skinned people in the place!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Red	In the beginning she out and out refused, though nicely, as she felt flattered by their wanting to see her dance, but one night when she mentioned the matter to [MASK], he suggested, even recommended, she oblige . . .
<name>Mr. Bell</name>	Mr. Bell	Sam	When [MASK] was still living down the hall, she hadn’t thought much about him other than in the beginning, when she always had the feeling he was watching her. And as for his sickness, she had just assumed it was the sort that eventually befell all folks his age and older.
<name>hero</name>	hero	Bird	and more dangerous than that same wet cat with its ass hemmed in a corner and facing its most dreaded enemy. And yet at the [MASK]’s side—at least still there in the physical and fighting sense—was the Snake.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Darling	“G’even’n.” The night was warm, but [MASK] was standing there trembling like it was Santa Claus weather. “Anythang I kin do fuh you?” She had her back to the kitchen light, but those pearly thirty-twos made electricity unnecessary for the occasion.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Sam	And also having them around each morning always got [MASK] untracked for the upcoming day and he was always showing his appreciation of this fact by filling their plates, bowls, cups, and glasses well beyond what many of their meager pocketbooks could afford.
<name>Patrolman</name>	Patrolman	Clyde	Getting some control over himself finally, but still cursing, [MASK] ordered two of the blacks from the crowd that had gathered at a safe distance around the scene to pick the beaten man up off the street and follow the other patrolman with him to the police station, where the attacker was locked up.
<name>St. Cecilia</name>	St. Cecilia	Wesley	Yet this move back in those pre-“black is beautiful” days didn’t get him into [MASK]’s all light choir, whose leader kept the “darkie” at bay with his always memory-refreshing description of the long waiting list waiting in the group ahead of him.
<name>Zeena</name>	Zeena	Sam	Three months ago my cousin . . . [MASK] . . . sent for me to come help him run the cafe here because of his health going bad. And since my coming here last month he’s done nothing much but sit upstairs in his room . . .
<name>he</name>	he	Sam	“Yeah, that’s okay.” The dimple disappeared from the man’s forehead as he reached out for the magazine [MASK] had been leafing through, swirled it around in front of him on the counter, and began looking down at the pictures spread across its pages.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Muskhogean	The little fellow also professed to be able to speak the Jews’ language, but since among [MASK]’s blacks there weren’t enough scholars of the Hebrew tongue worth talking about, this claim of his over the years was to go unchallenged and unbelieved.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Mag	Despite the great popularity of the cafe and although [MASK] had been behind the counter every day since its opening, the patrons had never really gotten to know this hard-working woman whose exceptionally tall frame seemed to grow skinnier with the years.
<name>Joe Christmas</name>	Joe Christmas	Sam	At fifteen she had already been the kept woman of the Man after running away from home and was now living openly in “sin” with yet another man, who some were going so far as to call “[MASK]’s killer” and who was doing business with the nigger-hating Boots himself.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Red	Write it right here next to his.” She sat with a tiny frown etching its way across her forehead, staring wordlessly down at the spot on the paper where with the point of the pen [MASK] was indicating that she should sign. “Fuh what?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Red	“You ’sleep, honey?” Getting no reply after several seconds, she continued undaunted. “Wha’sa limbo bitch?” Several more seconds of silence hung over [MASK]’s side of the bed before he finally mumbled to her, “The sister of all the limbo bastards.”
<name>Stagger Lee</name>	Stagger Lee	Sam	And whenever Dark Town’s king did get word of someone in the area who was considered a good player, he would send for them to come into [MASK]’s to play him, guaranteeing their bodily protection while on the premises.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	But most frightening of all was that day everyone went past only to discover that [MASK] was no longer on display. Fearfully, the entire black community waited for the devil’s next move. Three and a half weeks later it came.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Roxanne	. looking out of her front window. And at the foot of the hill looking up at her was the Hawk. The sight of the Hawk after seven years had left [MASK] bewildered, frightened, and somewhat giddy.
<name>Lula</name>	Lula	Roxanne	Annoyed, [MASK] got out of the car and began moving in the direction taken by her father. In walking slowly, and apprehensively, past the Cadillac she had to fight to keep herself from running over and rubbing the palms of her bare hands along the car’s sleek black side.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Maude	The two former girlfriends never again spoke to one another following that long-ago “poisonous-air-for-young-mothers” night back in 1925. [MASK], now stripped of all her titles of friend, good sister, aunt, etc., gave birth to her baby early
<name>Smoky</name>	Smoky	Bird	[MASK] started out in the woods as one of a two-man team on a crosscut saw, felling trees. But after several long and hard weeks of this he was finally rewarded with the outfit’s most prized job, driving a truck.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Sam	[MASK] wanted that goddamn stranger out of the building and on the road before anyone in the town suspected what had gone on upstairs last night, because if anyone found out, there was going to be trouble. And all fire blame would rest on his shoulders and just because he tried to help someone out again.
<name>Bugsy</name>	Bugsy	Red	For the general public [MASK]’s casino was opened Monday and Tuesday from noon until six in the evening, Wednesday and Thursday closing at ten and Friday and Saturday at midnight, with the crap table in operation only during the latter two days—the local paydays.
<name>Marv</name>	Marv	Clyde	After staring everyone down to his satisfaction, [MASK] would then spit in the middle of the floor, wheel around, and stomp out of the cafe with the sound from those steel-plated black boots reverberating off the walls.
<name>Brenda</name>	Brenda	Roxanne	And sitting there watching this striking black woman of the Hawk’s, each movement of hers exuding an air of surety, stroll up to and through the crowd surrounding the church entrance made [MASK] for the first time in her young, white life feel inferior to a Negro.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Red	and the will? Well, the lawman reasoned to himself, it was too late to do anything about the first matter and as far as the will went—if [MASK] didn’t get the building then the chief of police sure as hell wouldn’t stand to benefit any.
<name>Boy</name>	Boy	Blue	Here followed a short lull, when the only sounds that could be heard along the tracks were those of the crickets chirping from their grassy hideaways scattered up and down alongside the rails. Then in a somewhat different and mellower tone the man was addressing the boy again. “[MASK]?”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Blue	She had also thought the world of [MASK], although he had suddenly stopped writing to keep abreast of his mother’s condition and now neither she nor anyone else knew how to get in touch with him before the funeral.
<name>Escoffier</name>	Escoffier	Darling	But once he was back inside the kitchen, [MASK] was in his Eden. Here he could be himself as in no place he had ever known before. His many days and long hours of work rarely brought him in direct contact with anyone except those few who were allowed back in his kitchen.
<name>Willie's</name>	Willie's	Blackshear	Something made him rise from his spot on [MASK]’s porch and, like a giant lodestone, drew him across the lot, around to the back of the cafe, where he knocked softly several times on the kitchen screen door.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bird	“Why?” This red nigger was fielding [MASK]’s questions and slinging them right back across his face like mud. “ ’Cause my woman’s up dar. ” “If she wanted you up there . . . wouldn’t she open the door for you herself?”
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Snake	A short pause. “A dime?” “Ah right.” “Lemme see de dime.” Out came the dime and [MASK] struck a match to check for authenticity before pocketing it and turning to unlock the garage door. “Gawd hit’s big!”
<name>Ida</name>	Ida	Sam	But not only had [MASK] himself undergone a complete change in such a short period of time, but so had his cafe. With the Depression now well underway, most blacks in the area were barely able to eat at all, much less pay to eat at a cafe.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Boots	This awkward fear had first come to grip [MASK]’s soul on that long-ago Thanksgiving Day back in 1945, while he stood paralyzed on his spot on the porch of the police station watching the stranger walk down the main Drive with that catlike stride of his.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Roxanne	It was common knowledge that many Southern white men had always had as mistresses their black servants. But it hadn’t until just that day occurred, somewhat shockingly, to [MASK] that her father, her own daddy, had ever done such a thing with a black woman.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Snake	Frustrated beyond even cusswords, [MASK] started looking around for other means of breaking the door down, and in turning to look back down the stairs, he noticed for the first time the tiny gathering that had assembled at the bottom of the steps and was silently watching his performance.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Arzell	I heah ’bout you shak’n yo’ butt in front of ev’body wid dat boy [MASK] up in de yard ev’day?” “Nud’n.” “Don’ you nud’n me gal! Folks ain’ jes’ gwine ’round tell’n lies ’cause you ain’ doin’ nud’n!
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Baby	Then all of a sudden she felt his arm around her shoulder and he was sitting there on the bed beside her talking to her, all trace of impatience having left his voice. “Well, [MASK], tonight you enter the first grade.”
<name>he</name>	he	Blue	Then it was shortly after taking the job that [MASK] had thought of going back to school to earn his master’s before suddenly wondering, what for? To get promoted to mail carrier, or become a big-time sorter in the city’s main post office?
<name>Ponyboy</name>	Ponyboy	Bird	The prospects of landing in either of these two places weren’t what stopped [MASK] from becoming an arsonist, though, as by now he had come to look upon getting into trouble or killed as being as inevitable as a baby’s cry.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Sam	And for the first time since he had known this tall, quiet, and dedicated woman, [MASK] felt he knew and loved her, and despite being deeply concerned for her health, he finally relented to her wish to remain with him. Six months later she was dead.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clyde	[MASK]’s favorite time for visiting the Alley and its handful of small shops came, naturally enough, on Saturday, when most of the area’s blacks came to town. His first patrol of the back street always took place in the early afternoon of that day.
<name>he</name>	he	Clyde	. searching for that one missing bvjtton. No one in the cafe was to ever know whether or not [MASK] came up with that one missing button, but one thing he did come up with on that night was the nickname of “Boots.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	[MASK]’s return greeting sounded as if it had been spoken from under the counter; he stood open-mouthed, angrily watching the little black man poised in the open doorway and busily flickering his beady, suspicious eyes around the cafe’s interior.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Blue	Then on the street just outside the door there he had run into some guy even taller than himself carrying a newspaper under his arm who when he saw him had stopped and asked, “You [MASK]?” “Yeah.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Miss	She had her back to the kitchen light, but those pearly thirty-twos made electricity unnecessary for the occasion. “[MASK] . . . ah . . . ma’am, I’m hungry.” “Well, you come to de right place.
<name>Mississippi</name>	Mississippi	Sam	Matters soon reached the point that when black husbands and sons didn’t arrive home after [MASK]’s Saturday night closing-time, their womenfolk would pack their food and bring it down to the town’s jailhouse on Sunday morning where they, the missing, were more often found than not.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Blue	[MASK] came wide awake lying on the pallet on the kitchen floor where he now slept by choice, having reached that awkward stage of being embarrassed by sleeping in the same bed with his mother any longer, where she had had him sleeping until way past his ninth birthday.
<name>Sookie</name>	Sookie	Darling	Following an exchange of wet kisses, he would hand her a plate of barbecue or chitlins, which she would stand eating while talking to him. She would always refuse to enter the cafe, including the kitchen itself, and [MASK] soon stopped asking her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	.or giving away his own hiding place. But all he could hear coming from the hall was that soft, mournful music. Then long seconds later and from far down the hall back to [MASK]’s straining ears came the sound of a footfall.
<name>Nicky</name>	Nicky	Snake	Besides driving his leader wherever and whenever he wanted to go, [MASK]’s duty, besides working the casino’s pool tables, was to keep the Cadillac, which he lovingly referred to as the “Kitty,” washed, polished, shined, gassed, oiled, garaged, serviced and any other maintenance needed.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Red	[MASK]’s cousin had died of an apparent heart attack early Christmas morning, from what appeared to have been an overdose of holiday liquor. And all through the services (attended by less than fifteen people, due to the suddenness of everything)
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Darling	After hearing the story of his lifelong difficulties with his grandpa, she told him to wait right where he was until she returned, at which time she disappeared up the stairs between the cookstove and the kitchen’s rear wall. [MASK] waited, but not in the spot she had left him in.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Boots	And whenever he drank heavily, his talk was mostly about her; then he would tell how he would kiss the very ground she walked upon and the only thing keeping the “sweet dirt” off his lips was that son of a bitch [MASK].
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Sam	She was dressed in a cheap but clean and new-looking red and white flowered dress, tightly clutching a dingy flour sack (which [MASK] knew at a glance contained all of her worldly possessions except what she had on) and looking at that moment as scared as a baby rabbit.
<name>Ida</name>	Ida	Yassuh	“[MASK]!” “But the minute ya git outtah ya place by running ’round tahk’n ’bout what Ah’m telling ya heah then ya kin end up in jail. And by golly, Ah kin do jest that to ya ’cause Ah’m the chief of poleece!
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Mag	[MASK] knew she was going to die and for the first time since their marriage she asked a favor of her husband—to let her stay and die near him and the cafe rather than away in some strange place.
<name>he</name>	he	Blue	“What about going to college?” The man’s interruption came so abruptly that [MASK] had to think for several seconds in order to get his mind back into the chain of conversation. “Oh, that cost too much money. Much more than what we have.”
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Sam	Many said at the time, in both praise and pity for the woman, that she done ninety-five percent of the work in the family and [MASK] ninety-nine percent, at least, of the talking.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Snake	Occasionally, [MASK] himself would shoot a game for the house whenever a lone person came up and there was no one else about to shoot with—this usually happening in the early part of the week and then mostly during the day.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Jake	[MASK] was a tall redbearded man who became known among “his niggers” as “01’ Crip” because of the clubfoot that dangled at the end of his left leg and which, during those rare times he was ever seen walking, seemed to drag behind the rest of his body of its own volition.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Boots	This crowd—predominantiy male except for a handful of women whose reputations became soiled the moment they first set foot in the place—was a bullheaded bunch who accepted the fact that [MASK] was a nigger-hating white man and that the only difference between his kind and other whites was that he carried a pistol.
<name>Joe Christmas</name>	Joe Christmas	Red	Especially, she wondered at the time, why had [MASK] had his cousin buried so soon after he died and on a weekday, Wednesday, at that? Never before in her life had she ever heard of anyone being buried on a day other than Sunday, except, of course, white folks.
<name>Yoknapatawpha</name>	Yoknapatawpha	Lonzo	By nine o’clock, having sold to this last customer, [MASK] decided to turn in, especially as—being a free lance distiller and seller—he wasn’t interested in the doings of the town except when his making and selling of whiskey was directly affected by them.
<name>Sly</name>	Sly	Bird	That is, all but the Snake, of course. But [MASK] was brought up to date on his former friend’s progress within the House of Red—like recently having his hair conked to try and make it look like that of his new leader.
<name>Boo</name> (referring to Boo Radley from "To Kill a Mockingbird")	Boo (referring to Boo Radley from "To Kill a Mockingbird")	Sam	She didn’t have a single friend in town, female or male, except possibly [MASK], who was always very kind to her and kept her supplied with clean linen, coal and kindling wood for her stove, fresh water, and had even put up her radio aerial for her.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Sam	Where the hell was [MASK]? He thought of running around and going upstairs to see if the building owner was in his room, but then the idea of that Big Red Nigger following him up the steps made the Black Jew quickly forget about any such act of heroism.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	“Whar you say [MASK] was?” Concern now edged his words. “I sed nobody seen him d’day.” “He ain’ upstals?” “De do’ up dar locked.” “Wha’ he doin’ in dar den?”
<name>George</name>	George	Sam	And then came last night. Raising his eyes to the ceiling, [MASK] was still waiting to hear the first sounds of the girl’s moving about to drift down, as he knew she usually got up around six each work morning.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Sam	And after all, [MASK] thought, it was only going to be for one night. Edging slowly from his spot, the little man began moving softly down toward his room over floorboards which had been well scrubbed by his one roomer, but he had reached the place where they were becoming creaky to the step.
<name>Nicky</name>	Nicky	Red	[MASK] had taken her across the hall that first morning after all of the gambling equipment had arrived and been installed; he had told her that the less she knew about what would be going on in there the better it would be for them both.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Bird	Yet [MASK] was to learn quickly that those long in-between years he hadn’t been pitching had taken their toll on his once-great slow, lazy curve ball which was starting to be just slow and lazy . . . and fat.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	In the room where the man was there was only a small cot covered by an old cotton tick and for the night [MASK] had given him a quilt from his own bed because there was no stove in the room.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Roxanne	But the only bird [MASK] was interested in watching at this time through her “spy” glass was the human one that appeared without fail each Sunday morning down at the intersection to roost for several minutes before climbing back into his black aerie and disappearing from sight.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Sam	The room on the southwest corner of the building. And, with his voice returning to its usual hardness, the chief told [MASK] that it would be up to him as the building owner to see to it personally that no man, except the two standing there, got near that room.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Red	This upstairs gambling end of the business she had nothing whatsoever to do with—nor did she want to—and [MASK] never at any time discussed the operation or anything about it with her, nor did she ever ask him about it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Boots	nor taken his hands from the rear pockets of his khaki trousers, leaving them, instead to rest back with thumbs sticking out over the sides. What, [MASK] felt, could even he as a white man do to anyone whose hands he couldn’t see?
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Sam	“Suh,” [MASK] began weakly, “I ain’ ’lowed to serve white folks. ...” “I ain’t white folks.” This time the man’s words came out faster and carried a harsh undertone to them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	As he stood and watched the last of his customers leaving, [MASK] was suddenly brought up short in his thinking when he remembered the upstairs situation and quickly tuned his ears in that direction to try and catch any sounds that might’ve been forthcoming from on high.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	This came slowly and unsurely off [MASK]’s lips. He suddenly felt he had done the wrong thing by agreeing to let the man upstairs ... he had the weirdest feeling flashing through his mind as he looked down at the stranger that he was being “sucked in. ”
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Roxanne	As a child, [MASK] had grown up loving the little woman, though always a little fearful of the small figure of the maid frisking about the house and grounds always clad in that old black outfit while cleaning and always mumbling to herself about some real big man.
<name>the chef</name>	the chef	Sam	The only sounds now being made in the cafe were those created by [MASK] as he moved about in the small kitchen, while from outside the wind could be heard picking up in intensity, beating against the building as if trying desperately to whistle out some warning to someone inside.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Sam	During these ruckuses each Saturday night [MASK] always stood at the rear of the room, resting his elbows on the counter separating him from the customers as he looked out over the floor as if he were watching the day’s proceedings through a one-way mirror.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sam	Taking the paper bag containing a gallon jug filled with corn liquor from Big Apple, then tipping him a whopping fifty cents before shooing him off on up the Alley with the promise that the place would be reopened in time for the noon meal, [MASK] left the locked cafe for the second floor.
