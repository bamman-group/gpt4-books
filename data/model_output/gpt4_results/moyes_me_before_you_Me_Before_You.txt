<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louisa	Her face softened briefly and—without that customary, rigid expression—I could see suddenly how desperately tired she looked. I think she had aged ten years in the time that I had been with them. "Thank you, [MASK]," she said.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Will	Let me get this straight. You two are betting actual money that on a Friday night I would be at home either reading a book or watching television?" "No," said [MASK]. "I had each way on you seeing Running Man down at the track."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clark	[MASK], I can practically hear you starting to hyperventilate from here. Don't start panicking, or trying to give it away—it's not enough for you to sit on your arse for the rest of your life.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Will	"You don't think so? That man gave us front-of-house seats. You said yourself it was fantastic. The least you could do is thank him." [MASK]'s jaw was fixed, immovable. I put down my pen. "
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Will	your happiness in his face." I could hardly believe what I was hearing. I felt the color rise to my face, and took a deep breath before I spoke again. "How dare you suggest I would do anything to hurt [MASK]'s feelings.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nathan	I took one handle and [MASK] took the other and we dragged the chair toward the path. It was slow progress. I had to keep stopping because my arms hurt and my pristine boots grew thick with mud. When we finally made it to the pathway.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Louisa	1 thought ... I thought you might cheer him up. And you do—you do cheer him up, [MASK]. Seeing him without that awful beard yesterday . . . you seem to be one of the few people who are able to get through to him."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Will	"Delicious salmon," [MASK] said to my mother. "Really lovely flavor." "Well, it's not something we would have every day," she said, smiling. "But we did want to make today special."
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Will	I shrugged. "It's too uncomfortable for everyone." It felt somehow wrong, telling [MASK] my problems. They seemed embarrassingly trivial next to his. "I'll get used to it," I said. "It'll be fine. Really."
<name>James</name>	James	Will	Left. My heart rate began to rise a little, so that I could hear the blood pumping in my ears. I forced myself to think about [MASK] on the other side of the hedge, glancing down at his watch. It was just a silly test.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Will	"Come on. While the music is slow. Because I don't think you can pogo in that thing." I didn't give him any choice. I sat down carefully on [MASK]'s lap, draped my arms around his neck to hold myself in place.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Will	"What was the best place you've ever visited?" We were sitting in the shelter, waiting for a sudden squall to stop so that we could walk around the rear gardens of the castle. [MASK] didn't like going to the main area—too many people to gawk at him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clark	I fumbled with the receiver, trying to set it back in its cradle, and snapped my notepad shut. "Everything all right, [MASK]?" "Fine." I smiled brightly. "Good. Got a nice frock?" "What?"
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Will	"That's . . . very cozy. You both working for him." I wanted to tell him then, I really did. I wanted to explain that so much of everything was tied up in my battle to keep [MASK] alive.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pat	"I can do specialist. I do sports injuries. I have medical training." "This is not a sprained ankle, [MASK]. Really." "There's a man I worked with a couple of years ago had a client who was paraplegic.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Thomas	"Come here, [MASK]," I whispered. As he padded toward me, I could see he was still half asleep. His steps were halting, his thumb thrust into his mouth, his treasured blanket clutched to his side. I held the duvet open
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Will	The following week, if [MASK] noticed that I was preoccupied, he didn't say anything. We went through the motions of our daily routine—I took him for short drives into the country, cooked his meals, saw to him when we were in his house.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Nathan	"How's your skin?" "Bit prickly." "Sight?" "Fine." "Aw, man. You think we need help?" "Give me ten minutes, [MASK]. I'm sure you've done everything we need.
<name>Owen</name>	Owen	Will	[MASK]'s face was in shadow and I couldn't quite make it out. "Just hold on. Just for a minute." "Are you all right?" I found my gaze dropping toward his chair, afraid some part of him was pinched, or trapped, that I had gotten something wrong.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Patrick	Enjoy ourselves. Talk about something else. Not running." He forced a laugh. I sat down and looked at the table. Then I smiled. "This is really nice," I said. [MASK] could do 101 things with turkey breast.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Clark	I did not speak. And then I heard his voice. I was so close to him that when he spoke it seemed to vibrate gently through me. "Hey, [MASK]," he said. "Tell me something good."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alicia	"You look lovely, [MASK]. It was a great day." A flicker of surprise passed across her face. And then a faint wistfulness. "Really? You think so? I do think ... I mean, there's so much
<name>John</name>	John	George	Your job! Both your reputations! He must know it. It's a selfish thing to even ask. How can he? How can he do this? How can you do this?" She began to sob again. "[MASK] . . ."
<name>He</name>	He	Will	"Thanks for that," he said. I set to work, letting his hair slide through my fingers, trying to remember the few basics I had learned. [MASK], watching the film, seemed relaxed and almost content.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nathan	"I think that is a very responsible thing to do. Very civic-minded," I agreed. "I have always admired [MASK] for his selflessness. Especially when it comes to the fairer sex." "Piss off, you two."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Will	No dust mite escaped my eye, no tea ring my forensic attentions. I was dislodging the lime scale on the bathroom taps using paper towels soaked in vinegar (my mother's tip) when I heard [MASK]'s chair behind me. "What are you doing?"
<name>Maddy</name>	Maddy	Thomas	The only way I'll get anywhere is by going back to college. I haven't got a Patrick. I'm not sure I'll ever have a Patrick, given that nobody's been remotely interested since I had [MASK]. I need to do the best I can by myself."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rupert	It's [MASK], his old friend from work," she said, suddenly turning toward me. I got the feeling that this was in some way momentous, and that she needed to share it with someone, even if it was just me. "
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Will	The doctors said he was less than twenty minutes from death. It was not, they observed with exquisite understatement, a cry for help. When they told me at the hospital that [MASK] would live, I walked outside into my garden and I raged.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Will	[MASK] nodded toward the outside. "I want to see it." I hesitated, then slowly opened the glass doors out onto the terrace. The rain hammered down on the hotel complex, dripping from our roof, sending rivers running away from our terrace and out toward the sea.
<name>James</name>	James	Will	[MASK] just looked grim-faced and resolute. The other thing is how inconsiderate most drivers are. They park up against the sloped cutouts on the sidewalks, or so close together that there is no way for a wheelchair to actually cross the road.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Nathan	The car park had thinned out with the rain, and in the distance we could just hear the distorted sound of the loudspeaker as some other race thundered past. "I think maybe we should head back," [MASK] said, wiping his mouth.
<name>she</name>	she	Will	"I'm talking about learning to embrace a new life." And then, just as I waited to hear what [MASK] was going to say next, there was a loud tapping of a spoon on a glass, and the room hushed for the speeches.
<name>Deer</name>	Deer	Man	And you might not he here in two months, I told him silently, and immediately hated myself for thinking it. "Tell me something," he said as he went to leave the room. "Why isn't Running [MASK] offering you his place?"
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Patrick	What was he like?" "I meet him tomorrow." "Weird, though. You'll be spending all day every day with him. Nine hours. You'll see him more than you see [MASK]." "That's not hard," I said.
<name>parrots</name>	parrots	Will	They had special equipment that would strap [MASK] to them (apparently, the most important thing was securing their legs so that their knees didn't fly up and bash them in the face). I would show him the hotel brochure, but I wasn't going to tell him about this.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Will	They began to position themselves around [MASK]'s chair. I shifted uncomfortably. "I don't know . . . that's a long way for you to carry him," I ventured. "And the chair's very heavy." They were howlingly drunk.
<name>She</name>	She	Alicia	Apparently they're much more efficient than an open fire." [MASK] stooped a little to inspect this one, as if she'd never actually seen one before. "Yes, I've heard that," said the man. "I must look into it.
<name>Dr. Patel</name>	Dr. Patel	Will	" I grabbed the card and checked that it had today's date. A little bit of me was hoping that [MASK] had been wrong. "Is your mother coming?" "No. She doesn't come to my appointments." I couldn't hide my surprise.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Will	[MASK] said. I opened my eyes. He was right beside me, his head cocked to one side, watching me. I got the feeling he might have been there for some time. My hand went automatically for my mouth in case I had been dribbling.
<name>Terri</name>	Terri	Scootagirl	[MASK] wrote: Make sure you post up some pics of him in the bungee harness. Love the look on guys' faces when they're upside down! I loved them—these quads and their caregivers—for their courage and their generosity and their imaginations.
<name>Tricia</name>	Tricia	Nathan	"Well, she's going to be a lot of use on transfer," [MASK] muttered. "She doesn't look like she could lift a frozen prawn." "We'll manage," I said. "Between us, we will manage."
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Will	" I reached out a hand and touched the back of his shoulder. "Really." "There's a card in there too," he said. "Open it some other time." My parents made a huge fuss over [MASK] as he was leaving.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nathan	I knew it. I had half expected this ever since I had first received [MASK]'s text. But hearing the words fall from his mouth felt like a blow. "Don't worry," I said, trying to keep my voice even. "It's fine.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Georgina	I would recall the slight break in her voice as she tried to comfort [MASK], and feel a great sadness for her. She was, I knew, in an impossible position. But mostly I felt filled with horror. I was haunted by what I now knew.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lou	"Yes?" "I'm from the Globe. I wondered if I could have a quick word?" "The Globe?" I could hear the confusion in [MASK]'s voice. "The newspaper?" I stepped behind my sister.
<name>Jasmine</name>	Jasmine	Will	[MASK] said she was into fashion and that sort of thing. She was certainly easy on the eye, and had a lovely figure—but, honestly, I wasn't sure who on earth would buy the kinds of things she wore.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Will	I would show him the hotel brochure, but I wasn't going to tell him about this. I was just going to turn up there with him and then watch him do it. For those few, precious minutes [MASK] would be weightless, and free.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Will	"That's him." "He still works there, you know. In the minimart. If that makes you feel any better." "I'm not sure he'd feel entirely envious of where I ended up," [MASK] said, and I stopped talking again.
<name>Oyeyemi</name>	Oyeyemi	Louisa	Please let me know anything that you . . . you can come up with, [MASK]. It might be better if we have these conversations away from the annex." I stood up. "Oh," I said, "youll need my new number.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Will	That Friday it rained all day—warm, heavy sheets of it, like we were in the tropics, making the guttering gurgle and bowing the stems of the flowering shrubs as if in supplication. [MASK] stared out the windows like a dog denied a walk.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Will	We talked a bit longer, and then [MASK] nodded off. I lay there, watching him breathe, and occasionally wondering what he would say if he woke up and found me staring at him, at his too-long hair and tired eyes and scraggly beginnings of a beard.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Louisa	"Please. Please stop." I stopped, glancing behind me at the road, wishing that the bus would appear now, that it would scoop me up and take me away. That anything would happen. A small earthquake, maybe. "[MASK]?"
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Patrick	"Well, that's hardly the attitude, is it? Oh, look. Here they come. We'd better smile." "Go, [MASK]!" I yelled weakly. He didn't see me. And he flashed by, toward the finish line.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Will	I ran out of the room and pulled on a pair in the hallway. I pointed a toe, admiring the silliness of them. I don't think a present had ever made me so happy in my life. I walked back in. [MASK] let out a small cheer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Patrick	We had gone back to [MASK]'s house, a new-build flat on the edge of town. It had been marketed as 'loft living," even though it overlooked the retail park and was no more than three floors high. "What does that mean?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Will	She glanced back at him, and then held out a hand in a half-wave. "Well, thank you anyway, [MASK]. You are a superstar for coming. And thank you for the . . "Mirror." "Of course.
<name>David</name>	David	Will	"You know"—Nathan leaned toward me, reluctant for [MASK] to see we were talking about him—"I think the ranch thing and all the adventures would have been great. But looking at him now, I can't help thinking this place has worked out better."
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Will	At first the hotel staff wanted to do almost too much for [MASK], offering to push his chair, constantly pressing cool drinks upon him. We explained what we didn't need from them, and they cheerfully backed off.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Katrina	"Even if he'd already tried to kill himself?" I said. "In really grim ways?" "He's ill, [MASK]. He's depressed. People who are vulnerable should not be given the chance to do something that they'll . . .
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Granddad	I'd be training as a seamstress or a fashion designer or whatever it is that taps into what you really love." He gestured at my minidress, a sixties-inspired Pucci-type dress, made with fabric that had once been a pair of [MASK]'s curtains.
<name>him</name>	him	Will	The two women who served behind the counter pretended not to look at us. I could see them monitoring [MASK] out of the corners of their eyes, periodically muttering to each other when they thought we weren't looking. Poor man, I could practically hear them saying.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louisa	[MASK], let's go." I felt my eyes suddenly brim with tears. "No," I said. "This is ridiculous. We've come all this way. You stay here and I'll go and get us all Premier Area badges.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Clark	I haven't done it for ages." I was pulled back from my thoughts. "Oh. No, thanks." I glanced over, noticing suddenly where we were. "Why? Are you afraid of getting lost? C'mon, [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Will	I had to try for each of those ten days to forget why we were actually there—the six-month contract, my carefully plotted calendar, everything that had come before. I had to just live in the moment and try to encourage [MASK] to do the same.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Will	Go swimming, without help, and unless the temperature was warm enough to stop involuntary shivering within minutes. Even disabled changing rooms are not much use without a pool hoist. Not that [MASK] would have allowed himself into a pool hoist.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Will	But the thought of being out of the annex was appealing. "Okay. Give me five minutes. I need to try and get the smell of vinegar off my hands." The difference between growing up like me and growing up like [MASK] was that he wore his sense of entitlement lightly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nathan	I showed [MASK] the next morning, the two of us stooping furtively over our coffees in the kitchen as if we were doing something properly clandestine. He flicked through the papers that I had printed out. "I have spoken to other quads about the skydiving.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Katrina	Everything that is sensible, or smart, [MASK] did first, despite being eighteen months younger than me. Every book I ever read she had read first, every fact I mentioned at the dinner table she already knew. She is the only person I know who actually likes exams.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Richard	And your filthy underwear. See if she thinks you're such a—what was it?—hot stud when she's washing those for you every day!" [MASK] was vainly scooping up armfuls of his stuff as it landed on the grass.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Patrick	I could help . . . but I'd feel a bit worried about where to put my hands. Would [MASK] do it?" "You don't need to worry about that side of things. Really." "And what about his food?
<name>Ashton</name>	Ashton	Will	I wanted to tell him how afraid I was that [MASK] seemed to be trying to buy me my freedom. But I knew I could say nothing. I might as well get the rest of it over while I could. "Urn . . .
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Patrick	I was twenty-six years old and 1 wasn't really sure what I was. Up until 1 lost my job I hadn't even given it any thought. I supposed I would probably marry [MASK], knock out a few kids, live a few streets away from where I had always lived.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Leo	The writer seemed to have had access to his parents. [MASK], they said, had played football since he was three years old. His whole life was football. He had been injured in what they termed a "million-to-one" accident when a tackle went wrong.
<name>Georgia</name>	Georgia	Louisa	The conversation about legs and runs continued until I had no further reason to lurk. Brushing invisible dust from my skirt, I straightened up and said, "Well. I'll leave you to it." "Thanks, [MASK]."
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Treena	Jesus. They should be grateful someone's making the effort. It's not like they are." [MASK] took the other piece of Mars bar. "Anyway. Number five, I think it is. There's a computer course that he could do.
<name>Mandy</name>	Mandy	Louisa	I'll tell you if I think we're in trouble." He sighed, and I helped him backward so that he was leaning against his headboard. He told me [MASK] had been so drunk he hadn't wanted to risk letting her loose on his equipment.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Will	I realized he would not be interested in the personal minutiae of [MASK]'s life, even if he knew. "He's a bit quiet, though. Nice work with the shave, by the way. Good to get him out from behind all that shrubbery."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Will	issues"—but she was a busy little thing. When she wasn't looking after [MASK], she was dashing around, cleaning and washing, whizzing backward and forward to the travel agent's and to the library. I would have known her anywhere in town because she was so conspicuous.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Will	[MASK]'s voice would break into my thoughts. "No. Thank you." "Is my elbow too far over your armrest?" "No. It's fine." It was only in those last few hours, in the dark, that I allowed myself to look at him.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Will	He was about to say something else, but [MASK] moved his chair between us, effectively cutting off any further conversation. "Well be in the living room. Could you make some coffee, then leave us for a while?" "Um . . .
<name>Atlanta</name>	Atlanta	Missouri	If this is the wrong life for your friend, shouldn't the question be: How do I help him to end it? Best wishes, Gforce, [MASK], US I stared at the message, my fingers briefly stilled on the keyboard. Then I scrolled down.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Will	I felt [MASK]'s eyes on me, and felt oddly self-conscious for someone who had spent most of the previous week walking around in front of him in a bikini. I plumped my pillow down on the sofa arm.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Crash	He was yelling something up at the window, but against the general noise and catcalls it was hard to make it out. Oddly, whereas his CD collection and video games had been quite popular, no one made a move on his dirty laundry. [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Will	I owe it to him to go. Who do you think got me to apply to college? Who do you think encouraged me to make something of myself, to travel places, to have ambitions? Who changed the way I think about everything? About myself even? [MASK] did.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Will	I told him something good. Time slowed, and stilled. It was just the two of us, me murmuring in the empty, sunlit room. [MASK] didn't say much. He didn't answer back, or add a dry comment, or scoff.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Patrick	You could be a good personal trainer, if you put in a bit of effort." "I don't want to be a personal trainer. 1 don't fancy ... all that. . . bouncing." I mouthed an insult at [MASK], who grinned.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Patrick	"Yes, well, if you weren't so thick that you can't even get a proper job, you could have gotten your own bloody place. You're old enough. Or what's the matter? You've finally figured out that [MASK] is never going to ask you?"
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Will	There were tales of bungee jumping for quadriplegics, of swimming, canoeing, even horseback riding, with the aid of a special frame. (When I watched the online video this linked to, I was a little disappointed that [MASK] had said he couldn't stand horses.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Will	I was angry with her and angry with [MASK]. Angry with them for letting me engage in a facade. I was angry for all the times I had sat and thought about how to make things better for him, how to make him comfortable, or happy.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Patrick	It made me laugh and him so cross that he usually stopped sulking just to shut me up. "Oh, come on. I'm hardly not supporting you now, am I? I hate cycling, [MASK]. You know I do. But I'm supporting you."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Granddad	It was like she was half asleep. "[MASK], don't answer the door!" I yelled. "Who have you told?" I said when we reached the landing. "Someone must have told them. Who knows?"
<name>She</name>	She	Lou	I wondered where he was. I assumed they were all off on some family holiday." "They've . . . they've gone?" "He's not been in these last two days." [MASK] sat back down and slumped in her chair.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Will	'"The man in the wheelchair.' Nice," [MASK] observed. But you could see he wasn't bothered. He was all loose and relaxed, carried his hangover with humor, even though I had the feeling he was in some pain.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nathan	Any trip you want. Ill pay for you. For [MASK]. Just—just see if you can get him to agree to it." I nodded. "If there's anything else you can think of . . . just to buy us some time.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Will	Go anywhere where there were likely to be drunks. [MASK] was a magnet for drunks. They would crouch down, breathe fumes all over him, and make big, sympathetic eyes. Sometimes they would, indeed, try to wheel him off.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clark	So, [MASK], does this mean you owe me forty pounds?" The restaurant had been refurbished, the food now under the auspices of a television chef whose face appeared on posters around the racecourse. I had looked up the menu beforehand.
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Will	His eyes met mine, and after a pause, he let out a bloodcurdling groan. Then his mouth twisted, and he let out another unearthly cry. I felt his mother stiffen. "[MASK], stop it!" He didn't even glance toward her.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Clark	It took him a while to answer. I pictured him heading to the hands-free device, depressing the button with his thumb. "Hello?" "Is this your doing?" There was a brief pause. "Is that you, [MASK]?"
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Will	And, "No, darling. I don't really think we have a choice. We have very little time and [MASK] has agreed to it, so I'm just going to hope for the best. I think you really have to do the same now."
