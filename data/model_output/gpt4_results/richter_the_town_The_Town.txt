<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Sayward	When [MASK] opened the back door, the old man stood there with a drop froze at the end of his nose, his cheeks crossed and criss-crossed with a mess of wrinkles like scrub apples still a hanging to some wild tree in the snow.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Huldah	All that day and the next, the girls and others kept running in with wild tales of some dead body found in the English Lakes or over some hill and holler. It didn’t matter if it was last week, maybe it was [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Chancey	The boy couldn’t see him continuously, only when he came in range of the glass at which times he perceived wild and terrifying arms flung over him. When he got to the end of the piece, [MASK] felt considerably relieved. “More, make more!”
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Rosa	[MASK] stood very still when she heard the news. Never had she known their dark little box of a house to look golden as now that it had to die. Why, she had been bom in that house. All her seventeen years had she lived in it.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Rosa	“My father made me.” [MASK] let that turn around slowly in her mind. “How did he make you?” “He said it wasn’t right for us to go together.” “Why?” she asked though she thought she knew.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Libby	“Then your bill was thrown out again?” [MASK] asked him. Their father gazed at one after the other with sovereign disdain. “No. The legislature passed the bill. By a good majority I may say.” Little squeals rose from the girls.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rosa	“I want to tell you young ’uns something,” he swore. “[MASK] is your sister and this is where she belongs. In this house with me and her mam. Anybody that says different, I want you to tell me.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Guerdon	[MASK] had a letter from him just yesterday wanting him to come down and work. Now I don’t know why you say you saw him and rode a cow. Maybe you made this up, maybe you were dreaming.
<name>Mahalia</name>	Mahalia	Sayward	“It’s no use to come back now, for you have no babe asking about her pappy any more.” The sun was coming up when [MASK] made her way home, but her face stayed set and cruel.
<name>John</name>	John	Chancey	Your presence won’t hurt the cause—or the paper either. Perhaps you would be considerate and let me come along. After all, the governor is your brother, and I could do a little missionary work.” [MASK] wished then he had never shown the invitation.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Chancey	He stood there in a kind of daze, closing his eyes a little, waiting for her to reach and touch him. Something in him cracked when the spell was broken. “[MASK]!” an angry voice cried.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Sooth	All that came out of it was spilled blood, and sending him away from home for good. Oh, she would give a good deal to get this eat-frog feller alone out behind the bam and catechise him for thinking himself good enough for [MASK].
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Resolve	Now that wasn’t very partial to facts. You’d still have to walk or drive your horse or ox to the railroad. You could tell [MASK] was the lawyer for the canal company. Canal folks claimed the railroad a crack-brained swindle.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Portius	Then the other door opened and [MASK] stood there. His eyes were bloodshot but no blood flowed in his face. His eyes darkened a bit at the sight of his sister-in-law. Then majestically he made his difficult way across the room.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Chancey	[MASK] lay back in the wagon box. They were in the tunnel of the bridge now, and the dream was a very clever, deceitful and hard-to-tell dream, because it was just like it had been in real life yesterday when he rode the red cow through the bridge.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Chancey	[MASK] wished his father hadn’t said that. Now no matter how much he disliked the taste, he would have to drink it. More than once had he tried the watered whiskey handed out at the house to children on festive occasions.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Sulie	Oh, the Wheeler children had heard plenty about that bower. Even the grandchildren could tell you what it was like, a little bitty house made from sticks, with a bark roof, a block of wood for a table and a piece from [MASK]’s red dress for a table cloth.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Abraham	“We were never bom, my lad, and we never die. Before [MASK], I was. The sun sinks, but it shines on another land. Love abides. If she loved you then, she loves you now.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Rosa	But the most alien thing was [MASK]’s mother sitting here with him, her tangled hair falling over the soiled shoulders of her once fine dress with tassels. She was reading a book in the darkest comer as if she had owl’s or cat’s eyes.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rosa	He remembered now the strange thing she had told him that evening, but then [MASK] was always telling him strange things. He was not to worry too much, she said, about what had happened on the fairgrounds. Now that she had seen him again, she would be all right.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Chancey	“Moooo!” [MASK] withdrew with what dignity he could muster while their screaming and howling came after. You’d think his own sister would stick up for him, but he could hear her laughter with the rest. He dreaded meeting the family at breakfast.
<name>Scarborough</name>	Scarborough	Americus	This was no squire’s dry and hasty tying of a knot just to be lawful, but marriage in the name and spirit of the Lord, done by His bishop who traveled over two hundred miles just to say the words, although [MASK] had two or three preachers and circuit riders of its own now.
<name>Emmy</name>	Emmy	Rosa	That’s the way it went. [MASK] and the boys had to do everything. The wagon came right after noon to load their stuff. Her father, the driver and the boys carried out the things. The inside of the house grew bare as a nut.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Huldah	She gave no start to see her mother, and that showed she had peeked out of the window when she heard wheels. Only her eyes had a strange look that said, now how did you know where I was, but never did [MASK] speak it.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Americus	Well, if he liked it that way, it was all right to her. Never had she seen him so high as lately. Oh, he carried himself grave and dignified as usual, but inside he was pleased as a dog with two tails and a silver collar. Times were good for [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sayward	Also, I’ve known of her death for some time—since February, in fact.” So he kept it back all this time, [MASK] thought, turning the slice of ham she had for him in the long-handled pan.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rosa	“Sh!” [MASK] said when he hadn’t made a sound. How small they felt standing there or moving hand in hand through the giant woods. Up and up rose the big butts. On and on ran the trackless reaches of the forest.
<name>MacCann</name>	MacCann	Dezia	Take for instance, the remark [MASK] made at the table. Mark you this, my boy, there is nobody burning in hell right now. That is, nobody who has departed this life. The living may suffer, but the dead are free.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Rosa	But tonight when [MASK] turned to it, no other self was there. Never had this happened up to now. Why, she couldn’t recall the time when it had not been ready with an answer. It shared her every thought and feeling.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sayward	Now why did that make [MASK] uneasy? She told them they could go on home. She would come later. She didn’t go after supper either. Oh, she never saw a sick and wasted child with more signs of getting better.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chancey	she hissed. [MASK] meditated. She might be little but she could take care of herself. That was the way with women. They might look slight, and mild as butter outside, but inside they were spit and fire. The bride blew out the candle.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Rosa	But if it didn’t, she reckoned she could go to her grave ignorant and unawares. CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE # * * [MASK] s Cloudberries And are we not as good as the best now, grandmother? In everything but circumstances, my child.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Chancey	Once when at home he had refused to work on the lot, she had said, “You’re going to live longer than I do, [MASK]. Watch for all kinds of new-fangled notions to take away folks’ troubles without their having to work.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Portius	You could look across open lots on a hot day and see it dancing in the air like fat from a griddle. For some time lately she noticed that [MASK] stood a little straighter and nobler, like a pillar holding up his community.
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	Genny	How does that strike you?” [MASK]’s face hardened. “Well, I intend to go on calling it Moonshine Church. So I expect will a lot of other folks.” She nodded her head, took her wrap from the peg and went home.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Portius	That was a picture not easy to forget, leaving [MASK] feeble and leaden-faced in his sick bed and coming out to this delicate tender young girl standing by the door with a bunch of garden flowers in her hand.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Sayward	Wasn’t it a pity that it took the death of your father to fetch you home to your mother’s table! Even so, it was uncommon that he stayed long enough to eat. [MASK] reckoned she knew what he waited for.
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Portius	“Well, suppose justice is on my side and the law against me?” “Advocate justice though the heavens fall,” [MASK] thundered. “But what do I do if the law and justice are both against me?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leah	A lady from May-town sat at the black piano to play a march, and [MASK] sang beautiful. Everything was solemn as it should be, but you never heard such a lively carrying on afterwards. Plenty food and drink were passed. Sociability and good feelings flowed.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Portius	But it was [MASK] who gave the oration. Standing there on the strange movable platform, he ap- peared to pay no attention to it or the strange iron contraption in front. Instead he started telling quiet as could be how he had found the woods hereabouts when first he came.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Massey	It was raining. Out through the window he could see his sister, [MASK], and the Patterson girl trying to run between the drops like his mother said. But never could they. Wet as fish they would come in every time.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Chancey	His mother would say something like this. “You’re welcome to spend the night if you don’t mind sleeping with [MASK]. He’s such a little feller, you’ll hardly know he’s there.” And seldom did they.
<name>He</name>	He	Cox	Quite a few of our citizens when they heard about it turned out to see him dig. Indeed some of the select council came and watched. They agreed with me that there was no ordinance that could stop him. [MASK] shut himself up in his house for a time.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Chancey	“Why should I be afraid of you?” [MASK] stammered. “I could tell. You know how it is in a dream. A person doesn’t have to look like a person to be that person.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Chancey	“Maybe the Indians will wait, [MASK],” she whispered. “Because they can’t tell tonight when the sun goes down in the rain.” Something inside the little boy rose instantly, and with it a flood of feeling.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rosa	On the night of the second fall, [MASK] stood a while out in the back yard, drinking it in; the pale light, the utter stillness and the snow lying thick over houses and out buildings, bushes and fences.
<name>She</name>	She	Rosa	It gave her the same strange feeling as when her baby sister had died. It was the only sister she ever had. [MASK] was just a little tyke at the time, and many a night after that she would wake up in a cold sweat over the dead baby.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Alec	And [MASK] told of the first he ever tasted coffee. It was in a cup, he said, set in a bigger and flatter cup and tasted like neither milk, nor mush, nor hominy. The tears ran down his face, he claimed, while he drank it.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Turkey	He meant the new waterfront, the canal. “I have another place rented. It’s bigger than this with two rooms and a goin’ business in the front. [MASK] kin tend it when I’m off.” The first day of April was moving day.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rosa	Who was that?” she demanded but [MASK] did not reply. “Wait, I’ll go with you,” she whispered at the back door. She threw on a wrap and guided him through several alleys.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Chancey	[MASK] sat for a while with his feet down over the side of an abandoned boat, rocking faintly in the small waves stirred up by the boys. Then he lay down on the deck. The rocking, the sound of small lapping against the boat soothed him, but only for a while.
<name>Jock</name>	Jock	Worth	Oh, she would listen to every argument just and fair, but when it came to routing her from under her own roof, he might as well try to head off a gadd or talk down a whaup, as [MASK] used to say.
<name>Justice</name>	Justice	Chancey	Justice must be shown during life. It cannot be administered to those who are gone. That’s why I brought you in here today. I want you to have a glimpse of my religion.” [MASK] stared. His father sat there calm and untouched.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Chancey	“I’d sooner sleep with you,” [MASK] said to him. “Shh! Don’t talk like that. You’ll make her feel bad if she hears you. She likes you. I could tell the way she looked at you at the table.”
<name>Elvira</name>	Elvira	Wheeler	The man looked mighty sober. “I kain’t tell you, ma’am. I only bum charcoal out ’ar. Accordin’ to what I heard, she come to the Holcomb furnace house night before last. She give another name than [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Chancey	Many of those who had once frequented this room, [MASK] felt, must now lie buried in the church yard, but the intangible vestiges of their wretched sufferings still hung here behind the curtains, as their blood and ointments still stained the carpet and walls.
<name>crossing</name>	crossing	May	After [MASK], they met on the other side of the level, in the boat yard, where they sometimes glimpsed others beside themselves meet like shadows and disappear into one of the long line of boats moored for repairs.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Sayward	That wasn’t a town body, [MASK] told herself. No! Such would have fretted she might be upstairs or sick. It would be a terrible hardship to rouse an ailing woman in her eighties and run her downstairs to the door her own self.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wyitt	And yet when they got to be their own men nobody could hold either. Could [MASK] wait till he got off by himself? No! Could he be satisfied eating her rations and sleeping where she knew he was safe and sound? Not him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Guerdon	You’re such a little feller. If you was on one side and those two on the other, it would throw the whole business out of kilter.” “Yes, and so they don’t fight, too,” [MASK] put in. "
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Granmam	“I won’t be sick long, [MASK],” she promised. “She said I could get up Sunday and run out.” But though the child tried hard, she couldn’t drink any of the warm broth. She claimed her throat wouldn’t let her swallow.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sayward	“Then I do your mother the honor,” he said, nothing abashed, and you could hear the foreign saw or French locust in his tongue. He came up and gave [MASK] a springy bow. Oh, you could see he had plenty of cheek and wouldn’t be taken down easy.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Chancey	They had taken care of themselves in the past and there was no reason to fret they couldn’t do as much in the future. But [MASK] was her baby. She’d had to nurse and pray him into growing up.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Saird	but I can’t name you,” she complained. Something in the way he said “[MASK]” touched off a queer notion in her and when he came in and stood there in the kitchen with his hat on, a storm of feeling ran over her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Granmam	“Who?” “Somebody you never saw,” she said mysteriously. “Well, I didn’t see anybody around. He better stay closer so he can keep an eye on you.” “Oh, you could never see him, [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Sayward	Her slender legs looked like they never belonged in that coarse gray calico dress she had on, and her white face had the singular shape of one of her blossoms. Washed and rightly dressed and combed, she would be oddly beautiful, [MASK] thought.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Rosa	Oh, that was something to see, [MASK] said, especially in nesting time when everything was blue with pigeons all talking to each other like people. You could hear them a long ways off. “Ooh-coo-ooh,” they said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sayward	“I can’t conceive of her being happy there.” “Not if I had to work to make up for all those lazy shirkers who wanted to dance and play and have a good time all the time!” [MASK] agreed bitterly.
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Portius	[MASK] stood in his stocking feet, his coat and waistcoat off, his white shirt bulging around him starched and full, a mass of wrinkles and sweat stains. “You want to franchise some other ferry?” he puzzled.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Portius	“No, not with the lash,” [MASK] regretted. “However, I can promise to give the gentleman and his thieving practices a whipping with the tongue that will let him stand naked and bleeding a long time in the sight and memory of his fellow citizens.”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Portius	She didn’t trail along with [MASK] on that. Take away all the hardship from the world, and man wouldn’t amount to much, she opined. He’d just lay back and grow fat and feeble as a pug on a lap.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Chancey	She also wished she could find an elm like the one that used to lean by the old cabin, but she couldn’t tell a young one for sure, its leaves not yet sprouted. Every tree she and [MASK] dug out stood higher and firmer than she did.
<name>Una</name>	Una	Rosa	You need only dip your hand and see the mysterious light glow and sparkle. Watching now in the full lock, [MASK] could almost feel herself on some far-away isle watching the train of some strange swimmer in the tropical ocean.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Portius	“Let me give you some sound and gratuitous advice,” [MASK] leered at him. “Do not try to escape. It will only be used against you in court.” “You can’t hold me!”
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Resolve	He knew before it opened that he would not get his money. Had he been [MASK] or his father standing there with power and presence, it might have been different. But these men would only shoo a boy from one to another.
<name>David</name>	David	Chancey	When [MASK] went to bed, they were still in the kitchen. Later he heard them come into the room below where his mother and father had their bed. At last he heard his mother say the fateful words. “We’ll make you welcome to spend the night.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Alec	Already he or she was getting discouraged, for that knock was not so hearty as the first time. What a difference it was when [MASK] came last year, or was it the year before! Anyway, she was sitting in the kitchen that time when the knocker sounded.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Sayward	Of course, [MASK] could come right out and ask her before she went. But she hadn’t seen fit to ask the man she lived with all these years, why should she ask his sister she hardly knowed? Now wasn’t it strange that it didn’t bother her so much any more?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Sayward	[MASK] turned away. So that was his idea of work! It was bad enough for her own son to take stock in all these crack-brained schemes for lazy folks to shirk work and have a good time doing what they wanted to do.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Sooth	“I heard him,” her mother said mildly in her broadest woodsy accent so that he at once would see the worst of her. “I couldn’t say right off. I’d have to talk it over with your pappy first.” [MASK] looked at her quickly.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Chancey	The wagon had a step in back and when it moved slowly up the bridge hill, [MASK] waded in the water that flowed across the road and climbed up and in. “Hold on there,” said the driver, looking around.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chancey	The fifth time there he was, climbing into the basket. “Oh, [MASK]!” she cried aloud before she thought. “Take me with you!” By the look on his face she knew she had made a mistake in front of all the people.
<name>John</name>	John	Chancey	Her eyes were brilliant. “Brown, if you can, [MASK]. A golden colory brown!” Now he was almost sure that there had been nothing bad in the dream. Her eyes were clear as amber. All the mysterious dark flecks and shadows had vanished.
<name>Eudora</name>	Eudora	Sayward	About the only thing left around town was the ancient sugar maple half way across the square. It wasn’t much of a tree any more and hadn’t been for a good while. Once it had given copiously of syrup. [MASK] herself had pounded spiles in the butt.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	LAMB	Yes, she knew it now, if she never had before, that the world really moved. CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE * * * Past and Present A-ah, law! That was a time gone. [MASK] IN HIS BOSOM
<name>John</name>	John	Sayward	“You’re getting my wonderful sister!” she told him. “And now you’ll be my brother!” [MASK] could still see and hear her that evening when she made things ready for tomorrow’s breakfast.
<name>Jube</name>	Jube	Chancey	“Oh ye! Oh, ye! Court’s about to set!” Back on the bench outside the cabin, [MASK] heard the bell, too, and it went through him like a clock’s stroke to a doomed man.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Massey	He had to hug the log where his father set him, but she had no bad heart to hold her. And yet for a long time he saw how she kept away from the others. Did she have no girl friend like [MASK] did, he wondered.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Chancey	By noon the waterfront looked almost deserted. Every one else had gone to see the balloon ascension, the great bag and its rider mount the sky. Under the silent accusing gaze of her mother, she washed and dressed in the brown dress that [MASK] liked best.
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Junkins	‘You’re creating a disturbance.’ ‘Oh, hesh up, jedge,’ [MASK] said. ‘You’re making a sight more disturbance than I am.’ ‘You come down,’ the judge told him, ‘Or I’ll send you to jail.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jake	No, the real world was in the book she still held in her hand, keeping the place open, waiting to return to it as soon as this make-believe scene from a story was over. Nothing changed on her face as [MASK] fumbled with the bloody rag.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Portius	If [MASK] wouldn’t pay his honest debts, she would have to, a little slowly perhaps, one at a time like lawyers went to heaven. And if it took all she had, she’d have to spit on her hands and take a fresh holt.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Brown	The settlers and sawmill people had cut it all down. There wasn’t even a grove left to hold the celebration in, only patches of scrub overgrown with brush. So the last few years after decorating the graves, the people went to [MASK]’s pasture where the fairs and circuses came.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sayward	“I don’t see how you can be so cold-blooded. Think what people would say about us? And think how we feell We never know night or day.” “It’s better sometimes if you don’t know,” [MASK] said shortly.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Nilum	All the tales of Indian capture and torture he ever heard came out now from the dark recesses of his mind. Most of all he couldn’t forget the story and fate of [MASK]. Without hope he threw himself face downward on his bed.
<name>Silvy</name>	Silvy	Sulie	[MASK] might have had a hard life, but it was better than if she had died that time in the woods and been put under ground. She had grown up and tasted life. She knew what it meant to give birth to young ones, to nurse and watch them a growing.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Sayward	[MASK] went on silently with her work getting supper on the table. Now how could she explain to him the reason why she had done this. She didn’t altogether know it herself yet, except that once a woodsy, always a woodsy. That might explain it.
<name>Rayona</name>	Rayona	Chancey	It was morning when [MASK] walked in the kitchen and found the Indian chief there, journeyed all the way from another state, older now, dressed in white man’s clothes. He had become heavy, his rugged face layered in brown fat.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chancey	[MASK] waited as long as he dared. He smelled his father’s cigar before he got there. His father had drawn on his long coat with the black satin collar and now stood in the hall waiting for him.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Rosa	Now he forbids you two seeing each other under the penalty of the law.” Inside [MASK] shook a little, though she would give small heed outside. So there was no limit, she told herself, to the cruelty that wicked old men and women practised on innocent young people who never harmed anybody.
