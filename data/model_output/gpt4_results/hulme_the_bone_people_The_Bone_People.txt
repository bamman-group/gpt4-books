<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Joe	Me! he mouths, and grins more broadly still. “Yeah, who else?” she laughs and reaches a hand to him. “Well, possibly me?” [MASK] is standing in the shop doorway, with a grin as broad as his son’s.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Examinations	[MASK], and him screaming his head off. He seemed to come back to life very quickly. Scared as hell, but even when he was half-conscious, he was clinging like a leech to my hand all the time he could and they’d let him.
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Sim	“0 anything and nothing. One moment they’re all happy hide and go seeking or whatever, and the next boomf! [MASK]’s in, boots and all.” “But there must have been some kind of provocation or misunderstanding each time?”
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Joe	[MASK] had smiled. He won every game. “No bloody wonder I’ve never seen you play at the pub,” she grumbles. “You’ve probably been banned... how do you do it? Hypnotise the feathers or magnetise the points?”
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Morrison	"You heard from the inspector yet? You heard from [MASK]?" and I could hear him hopping up and down with some kind of joy. It giggles through his voice. It makes him sing the words gaily down the line. "OI won’t say nothing yet
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Joe	“Okay.” He turns away. “Uh [MASK]...” and he swings back quickly. “There’s a flask of brandy in the top cupboard. If you give him quite a bit, but slowly, it’ll probably make things a whole lot easier.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Simon	He had given the boy a sad smile back. Funny, thought [MASK], and ran to catch the woman up. Who? he asked. “A brother of mine,” and she began kicking the sand, sending it flying in sprays and showers.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Piri	[MASK] looks over it, over to the doctor. “I can make it out, but it’s not how he used to do it. And bloody hell, would you believe the first thing he asks is how that prick is?”
<name>Alayne</name>	Alayne	Jetsam	His kiss tasted of rum. That one’s kiss tasted of raspberries, from the drug to keep away dreams. What sort of dreams does he have that are so terrible? [MASK], she ponders. The old meaning was goods thrown overboard to lighten a ship...
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Simon	I’ll be quick as I can.” He had held the boy’s hand in front of himself, so [MASK] couldn’t see what he was doing. Cut, and hold the cut wide, so the barb pulled out doesn’t rip flesh further.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dew	Down the other side in a rush, where it is dark and damp still, crashing through loose clusters of lupins. [MASK] sits in the centre of each lupin-leaf, hands holding jewels to catch the sunfire until she brushes past and sends the jewels sliding, drop by drop weeping off.
<name>Telemachus</name>	Telemachus	Tiaki	He helps them clothe the body with the cloak. He places the greenstone round the withered neck, and the wooden spearclub between the cold hands. This is nearly all the rite and ceremony I can make for you, [MASK]. I am nearly dead inside as well.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Simon	[MASK] is squinting at the gold grass floor. “So. Today, I came here and left the note and then I took the morning off work, and went along with him to school to find out what started everything off this time.
<name>Geralt</name>	Geralt	Kerewin	A second thong, which could be tied round the thigh, hung in a plait from a steel-lined hole at the end of the sheath. A long time ago, [MASK] had engraved runes on the leather, filling the gouges with white enamel, and they are still there.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Joe	It’s a fairly messy bit of bait the man chucked. “[MASK],” she says in a hurt voice, “me baiting you is one thing, but I’m supposed to get bites, not get fed,” and cackles like a harpy.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Piri	“Given enough time, and the right kind of care, he’ll read and write as well as ever he did, I think.” “Yeah?” says [MASK], with a world of doubt behind the sound.
<name>Rangi</name>	Rangi	Joe	The old man smiles, and pushes the kete across to him. “Eat,” he says, and lights his pipe. As [MASK] eats, hesitantly at first, and then with a relish approaching greed, he glances again and again at the man.
<name>one</name>	one	Timon	He puts them all in a sugarsack, setting aside the cloak and the pouwhenua. As he is putting in the photographs, something says, “Keep [MASK],” and he can’t tell whether it’s a voice in his head or outside of him.
<name>Jewish</name>	Jewish	Ratana	She was [MASK], and I was Catholic, but we were very diplomatic about religion. We agreed to each go our own way, and let the kids decide for themselves... kids, aue.” He is silent for quite a time then, sipping his whisky as though it burns his tongue.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Kerewin	“A variety I guess,” says [MASK] frowning, “but I haven’t seen his sort around before.” The newcomer is the same size as the other two, but where their heads are neat grey with dark brows, its head is shining white.
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Claro	Aiii, as he straightens. I wish for one day it didn’t hurt. But it’s not all that bad, shrugging tentatively, experimentally. You’ll do [MASK], you’ll do. He leans over the side again. Still nobody’s moved.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	He shakes his head numbly. “I said, I hope your father knocks you sillier than you are now, you stupid little bastard. I said many such pleasantries, all intended to hurt... damn it [MASK], I’m just as culpable as you are.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Kerewin	He staggers to her and clings as though he is drowning. [MASK] slides her hand gently down his neck, as though in a caress. Her fingers rest a second, press there and he’ll got out like a light, but just before she applies pressure, she looks into his eyes.
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Simon	[MASK] taps his neck, No? “I think she’s glad I didn’t ask for help... she’s gone back to sleep a bit too quick, eh?” The boy giggles. “Hush up.” He kneels again, and mops up more of the mess on the floor.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Simon	When he does, his eyes are full of tears. It takes [MASK]’s slow headshake, straight stare at his father, so full of disgust, so full of disbelief, so exaggerated Regrets now? Ah come on, to break the tension.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Simon	He has nightmares, you know? And, Spooked would you believe? This is the shadow to [MASK]’s light. The self-control, the unchild-like wit and rationality he often shows, the strange abilities he has, are paid for in this coin.
<name>Taihoa</name>	Taihoa	Kerewin	“Aie tama, it’s just a nightmare...” he can feel the child’s eyes on his face, .. just a bad dream.” ii . . . and [MASK] turns to him saying, “That’s okay with you then sunchild?”
<name>heavenly</name>	heavenly	Rangi	Then the soul could leave the body, and hang in the sun awhile, like a cicada crawled from its larval husk. It would choose which way it wanted to develop, the earthly, or the heavenly, and if it chose [MASK], away into the firmament it would go.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Timote	A wave of flat and heavy music drowns the homemade plunk and whine and chorus. Stereo blaring, ingots of sound beating the ears, people stirring fukthisracket, louder louder LOUDER and someone bawls out and somebody else switches it off. Ahhh, snore, snore, except for [MASK], whimpering out of sleep.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Taipa	If only I had Shut up. [MASK]. The second week, she started packing. The third week, on a Wednesday morning, she turned from contemplating the bare library walls, and stopped, shocked. The man is standing in the doorway, watching her.
<name>Wellington</name>	Wellington	Chou	And the mysterious lines of the Duke of [MASK], hideously apt, but dismaying: One walks slowly and with hardship because of flaying. If only one could act as though one were a sheep, and let the decisions be made by a companion, one could still accomplish something of the plan.
<name>Ryder</name>	Ryder	Simon	“I thought about half an inch, and then I was being generous. Tough luck, tama. Where did you go to step on it anyway? Probably deserved it, eh.” [MASK] kneels beside him, but disdains to answer.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kapai	He waves it back and forth directly under her nose. “[MASK]?” “Ahhh,” mock swooning off her chair to be an untidy heap sprawling on the floor, and he nearly drops the lot, giggling. She must enjoy this.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Joe	“Might be an idea though... you really finished being sick?” The child giggles softly again as he tells him No. He has found the whole episode hilarious apparently. [MASK] hefts him higher against his shoulder, and sits on the floor with the boy in his lap.
<name>He</name>	He	Kerewin	“E hoa, ka pai.” “What for?” He stands up, and stretches, and doesn’t say why. Just, “My turn to make coffee?” [MASK] shrugs. “Okay. Good idea.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Singing	[MASK] softly, “What shall we do with a drunken sailor, ear-lie in the morning? Put him the scuppers with a hosepipe on him___” “Only, there’s just a shower here. No scuppers, no hosepipe...
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Joe	“[MASK] hit you?” her voice as neutral as she can make it. He opens his eyes. No, he says silently, No. “Who then?” anger running in a hot flood through her. “Bloody who?”
<name>He</name>	He	Joe	She wakes startled, her heart thudding. The air is full of alien sound and movement. [MASK] is up: she can hear water being sloshed on the floor. There is an acrid smell about. “What’s the matter?” She sits up shivering.
<name>She</name>	She	Simon	[MASK] hanging with both hands onto one of his father’s. Like he’s trying to throw him, judo fashion, she thinks irreverently, but likes the forgiveness and acceptance implicit in their pose. “All right, people,” she says, and swings her legs over the bunkside.
<name>She</name>	She	Something	She didn’t endure pain any more either, but swallowed whisky and hallucinogen water that stood in the billy by her bunk. “Every pig to its trough,” huskily one daynight, before lapsing back into slurred horrifying confusions of dreams. [MASK] screamed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marama	I asked him to get it ready for me by evening no matter what, and he did.” She has turned back to the unearthing of her small trees. “Mmmm,” as though she didn’t hear him properly and didn’t care to know. “Did you say [MASK] liked plants?”
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Dave	It’s grown abruptly quiet, all ears tuned to her. “Uh, can I get you a drink?” says [MASK]. She doesn’t say anything, staring the fat man down. He stares back, his eyes blinking. A fly comes buzzing past in the silence.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Kerewin	Cigarillo case. It is [MASK]. Scrape of match, and a flare of flame. The water is nearly all out of his ears. There’s a rattle as she puts the matchbox away. “So hokay? You know where you are now?
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Kerewin	The boy looks at him, still wine-flushed, but now his eyes are dark. [MASK] says slowly, “They were his gift to me this morning, and I appreciate them very much. But maybe an heirloom isn’t to be alienated?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lachlan	Holy ghost, it’s easy to talk with him... where’d [MASK] get this shit about him being a difficult kid to talk to all the time? “Let’s say it means a part of her broke inside. It happens sometimes to old people...
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mira	he had to report to us on a regular basis because he was more or less an illegal immigrant as well as the other business. I think the Ministry let him stay on for compassionate reasons, eh. He died at [MASK]’s place about six months after he arrived anyway.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sim	Speaking of howling, trust old heart-and-flowers to be crying his eyes out... where do your sympathies lie, child? Entirely away from yourself? Survival ain’t that way, [MASK]... though I do feel vaguely sorry for the fella myself now...
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sinclair	Even when he starts coughing on the smoke, he attempts to keep his eyes on [MASK]’s face. “Easy now, I’d better finish that off... well, you got all that part? Right, here’s where I need your help.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Eyelids	I’ll shout you home.” His eyes fix on her. All pupil, black, blank, but with an ice-glitter sheening them. “Yeah.” [MASK] hooding the blackness. “You do that. Shout us outa the way home.”
<name>Arvid</name>	Arvid	Luce	Still as if he’s dead. What happens if I damage him badly? Or kill him? He clenches his teeth. Like when I fought that shit [MASK] over his sneer that Himi would get to prefer the boys too, under my influence.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Haimona	But then he’s got a knack of going to sleep at peculiar angles. She lights the lamp, stirs up the fire, moving quietly. The child doesn’t move. At last she says, “Hey [MASK],” taking him by the shoulders.
<name>Aroha</name>	Aroha	Kerewin	No sign of reproach. The unlevel gaze is bright, brimming, but every time I look, the loveshine’s there. But ahh Ngakau____ In the early night, when it’s still orderly, less of an orgy, [MASK] plays.
<name>What</name>	What	What’reyow	“Uh uh, my fine feathered little friend, that will most emphatically take those.” Crickle crickle slip slip slip. “Heh heh heh,” followed by soft giggling from the boy. “[MASK] laughing for?” Silence. “0, sheeit. ”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Simon	She sighed luxuriously. “And just think, muttonbirds next month, and the whitebait season soon after. Who could ask for more?” [MASK] raised his eyebrows, and then put on a smile so she wouldn’t notice the dark seeping into his eyes.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Simon	[MASK], shift over would you, honey? This old chair’s hard as a navvy’s arse and it’s cutting right through me. Thanks. That’s another thing, can I borrow one of your cigars while I smoke it?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	When they grow. The poor old kahikatea takes two or three hundred years to get to its best, and that’s not fast enough for the moneyminded.” She pulls up hard. “I hate pines,” she says unnecessarily. [MASK] grins.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Hoops	She heads for the door, and her bag catches on the corner of a table and she trips. “[MASK]!” grabbing a man conveniently close, staggering closer against him, “All right, honey?” and the man chuckles, his arms moving up her.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Joe	“What is that?” “An antiseptic.” The old man grunts. “A bush antiseptic__” He had steeped and kneaded broad green leaves in a basin of water. The juice that he bathes [MASK]’s arm with is mildly astringent.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Joe	They reckoned he ate his grandmother in the old days. All I’ve heard of is that the old lady just disappeared and____” [MASK] grins again. “Well, he was nice enough to me, and that’s all I worried about.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Joe	“He’s right, I normally smoke these. A pipe or cigars on occasion, but rarely cigarettes.” She lit a cigarillo. “Ahhh,” hunting for words that didn’t sound too critical or meddlesome, when [MASK] says, “Him smoking eh?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Kerewin	and then he leaves the ring on the sill, next to the basin. The boy slid in through the doorway, and went over to the fire. [MASK], armed with knife and spatula, was manoeuvring whole flounders on to plates.
<name>Māori</name>	Māori	Maori	And I don’t think I’ll disclose meantime that I can speak [MASK]. “Kei whea te rini?” She stole a surreptitious glance. The boy flushed violently, reached for his back pocket, and then the colour drained out of his face.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Kere	I wish somebody would wake up. He turns carefully over onto his back, wincing. Still... he looks at the roof. There’s the lamp hooks, and hundreds of spider webs... all [MASK]’s people must be like her and grow spiders in their houses...
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Hana	The water trickles over his feet, sparkling and ice-clear now. He looks down at [MASK], who lies on her back smiling up at him, her face relaxed and full of joy. The stream flows from her vagina in a steady pure rivulet.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	OK	Leave some where she can find them. She might have been serious about keeping them for her family.” [MASK] signs the boy and lurches outside. He stands behind the fence and throws each piece to the hungry waves, telling them thank you and goodbye.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Simon	“If we’d known you were going to be glad to see us, we would have come much sooner—” She shakes [MASK]’s hand, “It’s good to see you both again,” peering hard at the boy, “and you’re looking remarkably good.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kerewin	Easy. It had been. But he didn’t know what would happen after [MASK] winning. He thought, They’ll kiss and make up, or I’ll get a hiding, or maybe both, but he had shied away from thinking much about it.
<name>Bunny</name>	Bunny	Piri	“Christ,” says [MASK] again. He takes a felt-tip out and writes on the back of his tobacco pack, I AM V. SORRY ABOUT THAT, LOVE, YOU WANT ANYTHING? and the boy snatches the pencil and box as though he’s been starved of them.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Theoretically	So long, o my heart, so very long__ She cuts the motor and the boat drifts a little way in a suddenly resounding silence. “[MASK], we are now over an enormous number of blue cod who never seem to have appreciated over the years that safety isn’t in numbers.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sinclair	It does, it does. He’s shaking with Yes’s, fingers and head. [MASK] says blandly. “I see. Well, y’know they’re all convinced here that you’ve been scared and hurt too often to want to go back to your dad...
<name>WHEN</name>	WHEN	JOE	I AM SICK SOMETIMES “Conveniently, like now?” She returns his excuse. “How often do you actually turn up at school? Monthly? Or just a couple of times a year?” He’s writing again. [MASK] SAYS I GO, I GO
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	“Sounds it, a bit... what does he normally do during the day then?” “School,” said [MASK] laconically. “He’s meant to go to my cousin’s afterwards. And when he goes to school, he mainly does too.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Simon	Kick. You’ll break the berloody window and I’m sour enough about the plate. Another boot. Stop it you little bastard, or I’ll stop you. And what does [MASK] the self-possessed do? Breaks down snivelling. Not cries of desolation.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Kerewin	Then, among the card noises, four “No’s” from [MASK], each one more annoyed than the last. This is going to be one hell of a holiday, he thinks. I’ve got a suspicion today is going to live up to its morning.
<name>She</name>	She	Kerewin	[MASK] asked, “So where is it?” She got very angry when he continued to deny he had it. “I know where all my gear is, at all times. I know what’s gone missing from here, and a lot has, boyo.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Kerewin	The urchin has snatched its hands behind its back and is standing fearful and still. “Ahh hell,” says [MASK], her actor’s voice full of friendship, “it is just that I get easily surprised by unexpected contacts eh.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Himi	I’d stay here all night and play chess with you if that’s what you want, and it doesn’t need an offer of tea, either. Because you looked after [MASK], and I’d like to do that.” Heap coals of fire upon my head.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	Sometimes, the waves grow hushed, but the sea is always there, touching, caressing, eating the earth___ She can hear [MASK] singing in the bach behind her. Then the rise and fall of his voice talking, with pauses for the child’s answers.
<name>June</name>	June	Joe	He nods. “But you — or [MASK] — can’t give me something like this. It’s beautiful, but also valuable.” She loops the decades round her hand: the beads are cool and smooth. “Superb,” she whispers to herself.
<name>Deirdre</name>	Deirdre	Kerewin	“Nice song,” he says, slurring it, “very niessh shong.” “Yeah.” It’s gone eight o’clock and the after-tea drinkers are swarming everywhere. [MASK] chattering to herself, “So ergo, the ego ain’t.
<name>Hei</name>	Hei	Joe	“An old one? Hei, that’s interesting.” [MASK] had been enthusiastic. “Have you got it here? Can I see it?” She had closed up. “It’s at home,” she had said cautiously.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Kerewin	[MASK] shakes her head. No use thinking about it. She drains her glass, slips off the stool, and heads for the door. The group at the end of the bar turns round to stare. The man stops his yarn and smiles blurrily at her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kerewin	It’s winter, remember you fellas? [MASK], look at your feet. They’re turning blue for goodness’ sake.” Her toes have gone a dull bruised-looking pink. “It is a bit chill,” admitting it with reluctance.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Joe	He whispers, “He’s got a skinful.” A skinful? 0, he’s drunk___ Very. He’s very glad she came, [MASK] tells her and the whole pub, six or seven times.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Himi	Momentarily befuddled again, “What is in there? I never left anything at your place—” “Things [MASK] stole.” A string of moneycowries she’d used long ago as worrybeads. A silver religious medal on a too-fine silver chain.
<name>Haimona</name>	Haimona	Simon	Quiet, eh.” A simple chord sequence, D A7 G____ “Tenei mo Haimona, e hoa,” and he stares wildly at her. This is for [MASK]? But what about the others?
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Simon	It made a wound, for all the child’s reacceptance of him. He’d gone back inside and cared for the boy as best he could, all apologies and endearments and tender Loving care... and curiously [MASK] hadn’t reacted with his earlier extreme fear at being held or thwarted in anything.
<name>Wiremu</name>	Wiremu	Haimona	“Tena koe,” he says. His voice sounds odd, hesitant, timid. “Tena koe.” Pause. “Uh, [MASK] there?” “No, haven’t seen him today. I thought he was going to school?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Kerewin	He gagged on just brandy. Don’t worry, I’ll get another bottle of each.” His smile is becoming fixed. [MASK] frowns and picks up the guitar. “To hell with that... if he wanted my tokay, he could have had it and welcome.”
<name>Kere</name>	Kere	Maori	E pai ana, e Kere, e pai ana.” “That’s okay,” but the thanks in [MASK] don’t, this time, draw the normal emotional response. He could be saying The moon, the moon, going by what she feels.
<name>He</name>	He	Simon	So much easier to flick s\/itches... she loathes all the cold iron frame of it until the fire is lit and it begins to live again. Upstairs, [MASK] is thinking. What does she talk like that for? T i fool me? and shakes his head in exasperation.
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Joe	“Three days ago, I would have laughed you to scorn, now I believe you,” says [MASK] simply. “You came up the beach, prepared to meet someone and help someone. You’ve helped me. You’ve told of all the years you waited, keeping guard.
<name>Severian</name>	Severian	Kerewin	“Well...” if he was going to add anything, he has decided against it. There’s a rustling of blankets. “You like a bed companion for a few minutes?” “Looks like I get one, will I or nill I,” says [MASK] drily.
<name>He</name>	He	Joe	Not a sign of singed hair anywhere. “Ta, mate.” She swaps grins with him. [MASK] thinks, Hope to hell she didn’t hear what else those buggers said, or that’ll really screw things up.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Elizabeth	“Aside from this morning, no.” “He does that every time it’s necessary for us to see [MASK]. And as far as other medics are concerned, he baulks absolutely. There’s a limit to how far you can fairly push him.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Holmes	She unlocks the small wooden chest that holds her Book of the Soul. Pretentious bugger, [MASK], taking yourself that seriously___ She weighs the book in her hand. A thousand pages of Oxford India paper, bound with limp black leather covers, the title blocked in silver.
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Kerewin	This,” pointing at his son, “refers to you as [MASK].” He glances up, checking for approval, disapproval. “Good. It’d please me if you called me that too.” She pours coffee into another mug.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Piri	“If you yell loudly, he’ll pick up some of it,” says the doctor softly. “He’s got residual hearing in one ear.” “Ah Christ,” says [MASK]. “Ah Christ, this isn’t fair.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kerewin	He took his time about waking, doing it slowly (because it is [MASK] sitting there, still squinting at the sun, still dreaming) until he was clearheaded and calm. Then he picked up the shard: still lying sprawled, he started building.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Joe	“Well, I never,” he says chirpily, “at home all the time eh?” “Not quite home, and not quite all the time... leave that in till [MASK] answers, will you?” The burr-burr goes on for minutes.
