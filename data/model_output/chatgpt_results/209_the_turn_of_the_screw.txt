<name>God</name>	God	Goodness	I now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and how weary at last it had made her. “Your letter won’t have got there. Your letter never went.” “What then became of it?” “[MASK] knows!
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Flora	“Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?” [MASK] luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile: “Because I don’t like to frighten you!”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Miles	When I put the question to [MASK], he played on a minute before answering and then could only say: “Why, my dear, how do _I_ know?”--breaking moreover into a happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Flora	“You really compare me to a baby girl?” This found me singularly weak. “Don’t you, then, LOVE our sweet [MASK]?” “If I didn’t--and you, too; if I didn’t--!”
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Douglas	“More’s the pity, then. That’s the only way I ever understand.” “Won’t YOU tell, [MASK]?” somebody else inquired. He sprang to his feet again. “Yes--tomorrow. Now I must go to bed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Perfectly	[MASK] can I recall now the particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every feature of what I had seen. “He was looking for someone else, you say--someone who was not you?”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Quint	I repeatedly sat up till I didn’t know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Douglas	“Yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.” A little to my surprise, on this, [MASK] turned round to me. “It WAS the beauty of it. There were others,” he went on, “who hadn’t succumbed.
<name>Mr. Thornton</name>	Mr. Thornton	Douglas	“I haven’t one.” “Oh, _I_ have!” I said. But [MASK], without heeding me, had begun to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the beauty of his author’s hand.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Wo	“[MASK]n’t, if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think it. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as possible and leave me with him alone.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lord	He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down to the ground what he ‘might’ do. That’s what he gave them a taste of at school.” “[MASK], you do change!” cried my friend.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Flora	I figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of [MASK]’s little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Miles	“Not half I want to!” [MASK] honestly professed. “But it isn’t so much that.” “What is it, then?” “Well--I want to see more life.” “I see; I see.”
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Flora	He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds--a figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom [MASK] was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Miles	“No more, no more, no more!” I shrieked, as I tried to press him against me, to my visitant. “Is she HERE?” [MASK] panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the direction of my words.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Miles	To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.” She was still vague. “And what IS your remedy?” “Your loyalty, to begin with. And then [MASK]’s.” She looked at me hard. “Do you think he--?”
<name>Uncle Venner</name>	Uncle Venner	Quint	I almost cheerfully rejoined. “He has provided for himself as well. But come!” She had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. “You leave him--?” “So long with [MASK]? Yes--I don’t mind that now.”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Miles	They were like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had--morally, at any rate--nothing to whack! I remember feeling with [MASK] in especial as if he had had, as it were, no history.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Miles	“Well, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.” I marked the coolness of his firm little hand. “Of what queer business, [MASK]?” “Why, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	IX	Then, before shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, “I must just wait,” I wound up. [MASK] I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from my consternation.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	VII	This second morsel, as I watched her, she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place. My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some seconds I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes--I faced what I had to face. [MASK]
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Luke	I quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth, held it up, and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on the great hall table. “[MASK] will take it,” I said as I came back.
<name>Miss Gostrey</name>	Miss Gostrey	Miles	Yet it was when she had got off--and I missed her on the spot--that the great pinch really came. If I had counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with [MASK], I speedily perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Miles	“What does he matter now, my own?--what will he EVER matter? _I_ have you,” I launched at the beast, “but he has lost you forever!” Then, for the demonstration of my work, “There, THERE!” I said to [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Miles	“Yes, I see that if [MASK] took it instead he probably will have read it and destroyed it.” “And don’t you see anything else?” I faced her a moment with a sad smile.
<name>Dr. Mandelet</name>	Dr. Mandelet	Griffin	“She was ten years older,” said her husband. “Raison de plus--at that age! But it’s rather nice, his long reticence.” “Forty years!” [MASK] put in. “With this outbreak at last.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Flora	When I’m bad I AM bad!” “I see, I see--it’s charming. But how could you be sure I would know it?” “Oh, I arranged that with [MASK].” His answers rang out with a readiness!
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Miles	While this was done [MASK] stood again with his hands in his little pockets and his back to me--stood and looked out of the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what pulled me up.
<name>my cat</name>	my cat	Flora	The weather had changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room, with [MASK] at peace beside me, I sat for a long time before a blank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of the gusts.
<name>it</name>	it	Flora	It’s YOU who must go. You must take [MASK].” My visitor, at this, did speculate. “But where in the world--?” “Away from here. Away from THEM. Away, even most of all, now, from me.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Flora	Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I transferred my eyes straight to little [MASK], who, at the moment, was about ten yards away.
<name>Bedlam</name>	Bedlam	Luke	I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting. “Well, then, go to [MASK], and I’ll wait for what you promise. Only, in return for that, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much smaller request.”
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Quint	I pressed again, of course, at this. “You reminded him that [MASK] was only a base menial?” “As you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.” “And for another thing?”
<name>she</name>	she	Flora	The revelation then of the manner in which [MASK] was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay was of course not what I had expected.
<name>Mrs. Grose</name>	Mrs. Grose	Flora	You don’t believe me?” I pressed. She turned right and left in her distress. “How can you be sure?” This drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience. “Then ask [MASK]--SHE’S sure!”
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Bly	“Well--I want to see more life.” “I see; I see.” We had arrived within sight of the church and of various persons, including several of the household of [MASK], on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Quint	I waited. “He repeated your words to [MASK]?” “No, not that. It’s just what he WOULDN’T!” she could still impress upon me. “I was sure, at any rate,” she added, “that he didn’t.
<name>Little Nell</name>	Little Nell	Flora	The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that [MASK]’s little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	XIII	“I would leave, on the spot, both him and you.” [MASK] It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as much as ever an effort beyond my strength--offered, in close quarters, difficulties as insurmountable as before.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Quint	Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. “He never wore his hat, but he did wear--well, there were waistcoats missed. They were both here--last year. Then the master went, and [MASK] was alone.”
<name>Valentin</name>	Valentin	Flora	My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in [MASK]’s interest, so beguiled and befooled.
<name>the suburbs</name>	the suburbs	November	On this, however, he faced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague, restless, cogitating step. He remained there awhile, with his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I knew and the dull things of [MASK].
<name>Fortunato</name>	Fortunato	Flora	he with a sudden fury gave me back. I seized, stupefied, his supposition--some sequel to what we had done to [MASK], but this made me only want to show him that it was better still than that.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Miles	“You opened the letter?” “I opened it.” My eyes were now, as I held him off a little again, on [MASK]’s own face, in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the ravage of uneasiness.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Quint	To play with him, I mean--to spoil him.” She paused a moment; then she added: “[MASK] was much too free.” This gave me, straight from my vision of his face--SUCH a face!--a sudden sickness of disgust.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Douglas	“Excuse me--I thought that was just what you ARE doing.” “In her successor’s place,” I suggested, “I should have wished to learn if the office brought with it--” “Necessary danger to life?” [MASK] completed my thought.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Flora	It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I hadn’t really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much worse--I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was [MASK]?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Quint	It has been easy to live with them, because they’re simply leading a life of their own. They’re not mine--they’re not ours. They’re his and they’re hers!” “[MASK]’s and that woman’s?”
<name>Miss Flynn</name>	Miss Flynn	Flora	On reaching the house I had never so much as looked for the boy; I had simply gone straight to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to [MASK]’s rupture. Her little belongings had all been removed.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Flora	There were naturally things that in [MASK]’s presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions. “And the little boy--does he look like her? Is he too so very remarkable?” One wouldn’t flatter a child.
<name>James</name>	James	Douglas	So far had [MASK] presented his picture when someone put a question. “And what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?” Our friend’s answer was prompt. “That will come out. I don’t anticipate.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Flora	I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty that [MASK] had extinguished it. This brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left.
<name>Thackeray</name>	Thackeray	Fielding	I remember that the book I had in my hand was [MASK]’s Amelia; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Miles	I markedly rested. “How do you know what I think?” “Ah, well, of course I don’t; for it strikes me you never tell me. But I mean does HE know?” “Know what, [MASK]?”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Miles	The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with attendance. [MASK], before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Flora	Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that [MASK] had let her foolish fern again drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Quint	“They’re smart, but they’re not his own.” She broke into a breathless affirmative groan: “They’re the master’s!” I caught it up. “You DO know him?” She faltered but a second. “[MASK]!”
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Miles	They performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of MY feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in [MASK] in particular that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Flora	[MASK], a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however, was to stoop straight down and pluck--quite as if it were all she was there for--a big, ugly spray of withered fern.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Miles	I felt that I didn’t know so well as [MASK], and I took temporary refuge. “You want to go to your uncle?” Again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the pillow.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Miles	There was clearly another person above me--there was a person on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn--I felt sick as I made it out--was poor little [MASK] himself.
<name>insanity</name>	insanity	Udolpho	It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly--a mystery of [MASK] or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement?
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Quint	“Of things that man could do. [MASK] was so clever--he was so deep.” I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. “You weren’t afraid of anything else? Not of his effect--?” “His effect?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Flora	“And him who thinks so well of you!” “He has an odd way--it comes over me now,” I laughed,”--of proving it! But that doesn’t matter. What [MASK] wants, of course, is to get rid of me.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Luke	“I have to see [MASK].” I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt proportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my truth. I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Flora	“Of the lost. Of the damned. And that’s why, to share them-” I faltered myself with the horror of it. But my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. “To share them--?” “She wants [MASK].”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Flora	“THAT’S what [MASK] knows.” After a little she turned round. “The person was in black, you say?” “In mourning--rather poor, almost shabby. But--yes--with extraordinary beauty.”
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Miles	“Why, where are your things?” “Where yours are, my dear!” I promptly returned. She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient. “And where’s [MASK]?” she went on.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Miles	“I don’t think your uncle much cares.” [MASK], on this, stood looking at me. “Then don’t you think he can be made to?” “In what way?” “Why, by his coming down.”
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	dislike?”--this	Of something much worse.” “Worse than [MASK] left her indeed at a loss. “With a determination--indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.” I made her turn pale. “Intention?” “To get hold of her.”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Bly	Come here and take your mutton.” He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and, when he was established, went on. “Did [MASK] disagree with her so terribly suddenly?” “Not so suddenly as you might think.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Griffin	“I quite agree--in regard to [MASK]’s ghost, or whatever it was--that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch. But it’s not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Flora	There was no trace of [MASK] on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came down to the water.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Flora	[MASK] has now her grievance, and she’ll work it to the end.” “Yes, miss; but to WHAT end?” “Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She’ll make me out to him the lowest creature--!”
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Douglas	I can see [MASK] there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. “Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.”
<name>her</name>	her	us”--I	I seemed to myself, for the instant, to have mastered it, to see it all. “Leave us, leave [MASK] was already, at the door, hurrying her off. “I’ll get it out of him. He’ll meet me--he’ll confess.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Quint	I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and I wondered whether, if instead of being above I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown [MASK].
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Flora	I turned and saw that [MASK], whom, ten minutes before, I had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice “round o’s,” now presented herself to view at the open door.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Miles	I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of [MASK]. I saw--I can use no other phrase--so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Miles	What was it you had in mind when, in our distress, before [MASK] came back, over the letter from his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn’t pretend for him that he had not literally EVER been ‘bad’?
<name>boys</name>	boys	Miles	This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Miles	That kept us a little longer suspended and unbruised. “I’ll tell you everything,” [MASK] said--“I mean I’ll tell you anything you like. You’ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I WILL tell you--I WILL.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Douglas	It was this observation that drew from [MASK]--not immediately, but later in the evening--a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Flora	[MASK] was so markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess.
<name>you</name>	you	Miles	She said, ‘Oh, of course, of course!’--and I said the same.” I thought a moment. “You were too sweet, too--I can hear you all. But nonetheless, between [MASK] and me, it’s now all out.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Miles	“No, I can’t say that, [MASK].” “Except just that one night, you know--!” “That one night?” I couldn’t look as straight as he. “Why, when I went down--went out of the house.”
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Douglas	“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!” “The story WON’T tell,” said [MASK]; “not in any literal, vulgar way.” “More’s the pity, then. That’s the only way I ever understand.”
<name>Madame Merle</name>	Madame Merle	Miles	The exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the instant, to meet him rather more. “And how much will YOU, [MASK], have to tell him? There are things he’ll ask you!” He turned it over.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miles	“But aren’t they all--?” “Sent home--yes. But only for the holidays. [MASK] may never go back at all.” Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. “They won’t take him?” “They absolutely decline.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Flora	[MASK] doesn’t want me to know.” “It’s only then to spare you.” “No, no--there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see in it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Bly	The summer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon [MASK] and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its gray sky and withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the performance--all strewn with crumpled playbills.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Flora	Then it came over me that, in spite of [MASK]’s presumable sequestration from the instant of her return from the pool, it might already be too late. “Do you mean,” I anxiously asked, “that they HAVE met?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Bly	It struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his head. “I don’t--I don’t. I want to get away.” “You’re tired of [MASK]?”
<name>him</name>	him	Miles	I see it’s the only way. What’s ‘out,’ as I told you, with [MASK] is that if he thinks I’m afraid to--and has ideas of what he gains by that--he shall see he’s mistaken.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Miles	So for a moment we remained, while I stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window tight. “Why, the candle’s out!” I then cried. “It was I who blew it, dear!” said [MASK].
<name>them</name>	them	Miles	Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never made [MASK] a muff) that kept them--how shall I express it?--almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had--morally, at any rate--nothing to whack!
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Quint	“Never mentioned her in connection with [MASK]?” She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. “Well, he didn’t show anything. He denied,” she repeated; “he denied.” Lord, how I pressed her now!
<name>she</name>	she	Douglas	But the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she engaged.” And [MASK], with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw in--
<name>He</name>	He	Miles	“I know everything.” He gave me at this the longest and strangest look. “Everything?” “Everything. Therefore DID you--?” But I couldn’t say it again. [MASK] could, very simply. “No. I didn’t steal.”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Flora	“I’ll be hanged,” it said, “if _I_‘ll speak!” It was [MASK] who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first. She was struck with our bareheaded aspect. “Why, where are your things?”
