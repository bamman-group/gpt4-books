<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mango	She does not hold me with both arms. She sets me free. One day I will pack my bags of books and paper. One day I will say goodbye to [MASK]. I am too strong for her to keep me here forever. One day I will go away.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Mamacita	He saved and saved because she was alone with the baby boy in that country. He worked two jobs. He came home late and he left early. Every day. Then one day [MASK] and the baby boy arrived in a yellow taxi.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Meme	Down at the base of the tree, the dog with two names barks into the empty air, and there at the end of the block, looking smaller still, our house with its feet tucked under like a cat. This is the tree we chose for the First Annual Tarzan Jumping Contest. [MASK] won.
<name>Tessie</name>	Tessie	Nenny	Getting too old? Getting too .stuck-up, says [MASK]. I don’t tell them I am ashamed—all of us staring out the window like the hungry. I am tired of looking at what we can’t have. When we win the lottery . .
<name>María</name>	María	Marin	Just another wetback. You know the kind. The ones who always look ashamed. And what was she doing out at three a.m. anyway? [MASK] who was sent home with her coat and some aspirin. How does she explain? She met him at a dance.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Rachel	We have legs. Skinny and spotted with satin scars where scabs were picked, but legs, all our own, good to look at, and long. It’s [MASK] who learns to walk the best all strutted in those magic high heels.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Magdalena	At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as sister’s name— [MASK]—which is uglier than mine.
<name>he</name>	he	Nenny	Four who do not belong here but are here. Four raggedy excuses planted by the city. From our room we can hear them, but [MASK] just sleeps and doesn’t appreciate these things. Their strength is secret. They send ferocious roots beneath the ground.
<name>Yes</name>	Yes	Nenny	She got three last names and, let me see, two first names. One in English and one in Spanish . . . And clouds got at least ten different names, I say. Names for clouds? [MASK] asks. Names just like you and me?
<name>Nen-ny</name>	Nen-ny	Cathy	[MASK] is tugging my arm and I know whatever I do next will make her mad forever. Wait a minute, I say, and run inside to get the five dollars. I have three dollars saved and I take two of Nen-ny’s.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Rachel	People on the bus wave. A very fat lady crossing the street says, You sure got quite a load there. [MASK] shouts, You got quite a load there too. She is very sassy. Down, down Mango Street we go.
<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Sally	Just because I’m a daughter, and then she doesn’t say. [MASK] was going to get permission to stay with us a little and one Thursday she came finally with a sack full of clothes and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Louie	You’re in love and so am ah-ay. [MASK] has another cousin. We only saw him once, but it was important. We were playing volleyball in the alley when he drove up in this great big yellow Cadillac with whitewalls and a yellow scarf tied around the mirror.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Sire	Not this way, every evening talking to the trees, leaning out my window, imagining what I can’t see. A boy held me once so hard, I swear, I felt the grip and weight of his arms, but it was a dream. [MASK].
<name>Max</name>	Max	Esperanza	A long silence. When you leave you must remember always to come back, she said. What? When you leave you must remember to come back for the others. A circle, understand? You will always be [MASK].
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Ruthie	Then she promises to see the dentist next week, but when next week comes, she doesn’t go. [MASK] sees lovely things everywhere. I might be telling her ajoke and she’ll stop and say: The moon is beautiful like a balloon.
<name>Little Red Riding Hood</name>	Little Red Riding Hood	Ruthie	[MASK] looked at the sky and her eyes got watery at times. Finally I came to the last lines: “But answer came there none—and this was scarcely odd, because they’d eaten every one . . .”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rachel	It’s gotta be just so, I say. Not too fast and not too slow. Not too fast and not too slow. We slow the double circles down to a certain speed so [MASK] who has just jumped in can practice shaking it.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Sally	He never hits me hard. But [MASK] doesn’t tell about that time he hit her with his hands just like a dog, she said, like if I was an animal. He thinks I’m going to run away like his sisters who made the family ashamed.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Cathy	They already have ten dollars and all they need is five more. Only five dollars, she says. Don’t talk to them, says [MASK]. Can’t you see they smell like a broom. But I like them. Their clothes are crooked and old.
<name>he</name>	he	Holy	She knows to say: He not here for when the landlord comes, No speak English if anybody else comes, and [MASK] smokes. I don’t know where she learned this, but I heard her say it one time and it surprised me.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Alicia	I don’t belong. I don’t ever want to come from here. You have a home, [MASK], and one day you’ll go there, to a town you remem- ber, but me I never had a house, not even a photograph . ..
<name>Edwina</name>	Edwina	Sally	And the next. Until the way [MASK] tells it, he just went crazy, he just forgot he was her father between the buckle and the belt. You’re not my daughter, you’re not my daughter. And then he broke into his hands.
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Sally	What [MASK] Said He never hits me hard. She said her mama rubs lard on all the places where it hurts. Then at school she’d say she fell. That’s where all the blue places come from. That’s why her skin is always scarred.
<name>Nanook</name>	Nanook	Rachel	ummm . .. . . . like bare feet in September! That does it! Both of yous better get out of my yard before I call my brothers. Oh, we’re only playing. I can think of thirty Eskimo words for you, [MASK].
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Darius	[MASK], who chases girls with firecrackers or a stick that touched a rat and thinks he’s tough, today pointed up because the world was full of clouds, the kind like pillows. You all see that cloud, that fat one there?
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Sally	But when I got there [MASK] said go home. Those boys said leave us alone. I felt stupid with my brick. They all looked at me as if I was the one that was crazy and made me feel ashamed. And then I don’t know why
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Nenny	You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know—like if half of you wanted to go one way and the other half the other. That’s to lullaby it, [MASK] says, that’s to rock the baby asleep inside you.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Nenny	But [MASK], I hear her asking one time how’s this here and the man says, This, this is a music box, and I turn around quick thinking he means a pretty box with flowers painted on it, with a ballerina inside.
<name>Georgia</name>	Georgia	Darius	Is a good girl, my friend, studies all night and sees the mice, the ones her father says do not exist. Is afraid of nothing except four-legged fur. And fathers. [MASK] 8c the Clouds You can never have too much sky.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Louie	We each had to sit with one of [MASK]’s little sisters on our lap, but that was okay. The seats were big and soft like a sofa, and there was a little white cat in the back window whose eyes lit up when the car stopped or turned.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Alicia	Their mother said no, no, don’t ever sell it. I won’t. And then she closed her eyes and he sold it. [MASK] is stuck-up ever since she went to college. She used to like me but now she doesn’t.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Rafaela	On the corner there is music from the bar, and [MASK] wishes she could go there and dance before she gets old. A long time passes and we forget she is up there watching until she says: Kids, if I give you a dollar will you go to the store and buy me something?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Edna	You don’t want to know them. [MASK] is the lady who owns the building next to you. She used to own a building big as a whale, but her brother sold it. Their mother said no, no, don’t ever sell it.
<name>Ignoramus</name>	Ignoramus	Darius	Still, we take what we can get and make the best of it. [MASK], who doesn’t like school, who is sometimes stupid and mostly a fool, said something wise today, though most days he says nothing.
<name>Mr. Gatz</name>	Mr. Gatz	Earl	This is the only time we see [MASK] except for when he comes and goes to work. He has two little black dogs that go everywhere with him. They don’t walk like ordinary dogs, but leap and somersault like an apostrophe and comma.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Cathy	She’s not home, but I’m sure she’ll be glad when she finds out we own a bike. When I get back, [MASK] is gone like I knew she would be, but I don’t care. I have two new friends and a bike too.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Sally	And kept on ironing. I looked at her a long time, but couldn’t think of anything to say, and ran back down the three flights to the garden where [MASK] needed to be saved. I took three big sticks and a brick and figured this was enough.
<name>Miss Lonelyhearts</name>	Miss Lonelyhearts	Rachel	She is young and dizzy to hear so many sweet things in one day, even if it is a bum man’s whiskey words saying them. [MASK], you are prettier than a yellow taxicab. You know that? But we don’t like it.
<name>The Fairy</name>	The Fairy	Esperanza	Well, why not? I closed my eyes. Did you wish already? Yes, I said. Well, that’s all there is to it. It’ll come true. How do you know? I asked. We know, we know. [MASK].
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Marin	She is there every night with the radio. When the light in her aunt’s room goes out, [MASK] lights a cigarette and it doesn’t matter if it’s cold out or if the radio doesn’t work or if we’ve got nothing to say to each other.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Geraldo	All this for five dollars I give her. Thank you and goodbye and be careful of the evil eye. Come back again on a Thursday when the stars are stronger. And may the Virgin bless you. And shuts the door. [MASK] No Last Name
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mango	Only a house quiet as snow, a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem. [MASK] Says Goodbye Sometimes I like to tell stories. I tell them inside my head. I tell them after the mailman says, Here’s your mail.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Louie	Instead there was a button that did it for you automatically. We rode up the alley and around the block six times, but [MASK]’s cousin said he was going to make us walk home if we didn’t stop playing with the windows or touching the FM radio.
<name>Annemarie</name>	Annemarie	Lucy	You gotta get the rhythm, and [MASK] begins to dance. She has the idea, though she’s having trouble keeping her end of the double-dutch steady. It’s gotta be just so, I say. Not too fast and not too slow.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Marin	[MASK], under the streetlight, dancing by herself, is singing the same song somewhere. I know. Is waiting for a car to stop, a star to fall, someone to change her life. Those Who Don’t Those who don’t know any better come into our neighborhood scared.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Flowers	This was a garden, a wonderful thing to look at in the spring. But bit by bit, after the monkey left, the garden began to take over itself. [MASK] stopped obeying the little bricks that kept them from growing beyond their paths. Weeds mixed in.
<name>son</name>	son	Esperanza	One day I’ll jump out of my skin. I’ll shake the sky like a hundred violins. That’s nice. That’s very good, she said in her tired voice. You just remember to keep writing, [MASK]. You must keep writing.
<name>Meme</name>	Meme	Cathy	The dog is big, like a man dressed in a dog suit, and runs the same way its owner does, clumsy and wild and with the limbs flopping all over the place like untied shoes. [MASK]’s father built the house Meme moved into.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Elenita	Ah, yes, a home in the heart. I see a home in the heart. Is that it? That’s what I see, she says, then gets up because the kids are fighting. [MASK] gets up to hit and then hug them.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Lucy	We will never go back to wearing the other kind again. Do you like these shoes? In front of the laundromat six girls with the same fat face pretend we are invisible. They are the cousins, [MASK] says, and always jealous. We just keep strutting.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Baby	Bad spirits keeping you awake? Sleep next to a holy candle for seven days, then on the eighth day, spit. And lots of other stuff. Only now she can tell I’m sad. [MASK], I’ll look again if you want me to.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Mamacita	Four who grew despite concrete. Four who reach and do not forget to reach. Four whose only reason is to be and be. No Speak English [MASK] is the big mama of the man across the street, third-floor front.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Esperanza	[MASK]. She held my face with her blue-veined hands and looked and looked at me. A long silence. When you leave you must remember always to come back, she said. What? When you leave you must remember to come back for the others.
<name>Imelda</name>	Imelda	Lucy	[MASK] hides the lemon shoes and the red shoes and the shoes that used to be white but are now pale blue under a powerful bushel basket on the back porch, until one Tuesday her mother, who is very clean, throws them away. But no one complains.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Totchy	We took turns being her. We screamed in the weak voice of a parrot for [MASK] to come and wash those dishes. It was easy. We didn’t know. She had been dying such a long time, we forgot. Maybe she was ashamed.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Louie	She can’t come out—gotta baby-sit with [MASK]’s sisters—but she stands in the doorway a lot, all the time singing, clicking her fingers, the same song: Apples, peaches, pumpkin pah-ay.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Rachel	One day you wake up and they are there. Ready and waiting like a new Buick with the keys in the ignition. Ready to take you where? They’re good for holding a baby when you’re cooking, [MASK] says, turning the jump rope a little quicker.
<name>Taylor</name>	Taylor	Cathy	She used to like me but now she doesn’t. [MASK] who is queen of cats has cats and cats and cats. Baby cats, big cats, skinny cats, sick cats. Cats asleep like little donuts. Cats on top of the refrigerator.
<name>Sylvia</name>	Sylvia	Nenny	But [MASK], who is stupider, already is asking how much and I can see her fingers going for the quarters in her pants pocket. This, the old man says shutting the lid, this ain’t for sale.
<name>Deborah</name>	Deborah	Sally	Who was it I didn’t listen to? I only remember that when the others ran, I wanted to run too, up and down and through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like [MASK] who screamed if she got her stockings muddy.
<name>chef</name>	chef	Spartan	I’m no [MASK] and hold up an anemic wrist to prove it. I can’t even blow up a balloon without getting dizzy. And besides, I know how to make my own lunch. If I ate at school there’d be less dishes to wash.
<name>unspecified</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unspecified (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Sally	There’d be no nosy neighbors watching, no motorcycles and cars, no sheets and towels and laundry. Only trees and more trees and plenty of blue sky. And you could laugh, [MASK]. You could go to sleep and wake up and never have to think who likes and doesn’t like you.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Louie	We only saw him once, but it was important. We were playing volleyball in the alley when he drove up in this great big yellow Cadillac with whitewalls and a yellow scarf tied around the mirror. [MASK]’s cousin had his arm out the window.
<name>Mrs. Johnson</name>	Mrs. Johnson	Sally	Your son and his friends stole [MASK]’s keys and now they won’t give them back unles she kisses them and right now they’re making her kiss them, I said all out of breath from the three flights of stairs. Those kids, she said, not looking up from her ironing.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Rachel	Or merengue. Or electricity. Or tembleque! Yes, tembleque. That’s a good one. And then it’s [MASK] who starts it: Skip, skip, snake in your hips. Wiggle around and break your lip.
<name>Laila</name>	Laila	Sally	Her father says to be this beautiful is trouble. They are very strict in his religion. They are not supposed to dance. He remembers his sisters and is sad. Then she can’t go out. [MASK] I mean.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Nenny	There are a million zillion kinds, says [MASK]. No two exactly alike. Only how do you remember which one is which? She got three last names and, let me see, two first names. One in English and one in Spanish . . .
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Totchy	It could be true she didn’t dive right one day and hurt her spine. Or maybe the story that she fell very hard from a high step stool, like [MASK] said, is true. But I think diseases have no eyes.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Earl	In his apartment are boxes and boxes of 45 records, moldy and damp like the smell that comes out of his apartment whenever he opens the door. He gives the records away to us—all except the country and western. The word is that [MASK] is married and has a wife somewhere.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Mango	I put it down on paper and then the ghost does not ache so much. I write it down and [MASK] says goodbye sometimes. She does not hold me with both arms. She sets me free. One day I will pack my bags of books and paper.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Lucy	You know that? But we don’t like it. We got to go, [MASK] says. If I give you a dollar will you kiss me? How about a dollar. I give you a dollar, and he looks in his pocket for wrinkled money.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Rats	I’ll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house. Some days after dinner, guests and I will sit in front of a fire. Floorboards will squeak upstairs. The attic grumble. [MASK]?
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Geraldo	They never saw the kitchenettes. They never knew about the two-room flats and sleeping rooms he rented, the weekly money orders sent home, the currency exchange. How could they? His name was [MASK]. And his home is in another country.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Esperanza	[MASK] ... a good good name. My knees hurt, the one with the funny laugh complained. Tomorrow it will rain. Yes, tomorrow, they said. How do you know? I asked. We know. Look at her hands, cat-eyed said.
<name>E.T.</name>	E.T.	Nenny	Yes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so ... [MASK], I say, but she doesn’t hear me. She is too many light-years away. She is in a world we don’t belong to anymore.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Louie	The nose of that yellow Cadillac was all pleated like an alligator’s, and except for a bloody lip and a bruised forehead, [MASK]’s cousin was okay. They put handcuffs on him and put him in the backseat of the cop car, and we all waved as they drove away.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Geraldo	That’s all. Green pants and Saturday shirt. [MASK]. That’s what he told her. And how was she to know she’d be the last one to see him alive. An accident, don’t you know. Hit-and-run.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Rafaela	[MASK] who drinks and drinks coconut and papaya juice on Tuesdays and wishes there were sweeter drinks, not bitter like an empty room, but sweet sweet like the island, like the dance hall down the street where women much older than her throw green eyes easily like dice and open homes with keys.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Lucy	Wiggle around and break your lip. [MASK] waits a minute before her turn. She is thinking. Then she begins: The waitress with the big fat hips who pays the rent with taxi tips . . . says nobody in town will kiss her on the lips because. . .
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Marin	We saw the yellow Cadillac at the end of the block trying to make a left-hand turn, but our alley is too skinny and the car crashed into a lamppost. [MASK] screamed and we ran down the block to where the cop car’s siren spun a dizzy blue.
<name>Uncertain</name>	Uncertain	Sally	What he did. Where he touched me. I didn’t want it, [MASK]. The way they said it, the way it’s supposed to be, all the storybooks and movies, why did you lie to me? I was waiting by the red clowns.
<name>any proper name</name> (There is no specific name given in the passage)	any proper name (There is no specific name given in the passage)	Nenny	The boys and the girls live in separate worlds. The boys in their universe and we in ours. My brothers for example. They’ve got plenty to say to me and [MASK] inside the house. But outside they can’t be seen talking to girls.
<name>Bigger</name>	Bigger	Geraldo	[MASK] going to a dance. What does it matter? They never saw the kitchenettes. They never knew about the two-room flats and sleeping rooms he rented, the weekly money orders sent home, the currency exchange. How could they?
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Sally	I hold your change, wave, count how many times you go by. Those boys that look at you because you’re pretty. I like to be with you, [MASK]. You’re my friend. But that big boy, where did he take you?
<name>invisible</name>	invisible	Sally	There is no one to lend you her hairbrush. The stories the boys tell in the coatroom, they’re not true. You lean against the schoolyard fence alone with your eyes closed as if no one was watching, as if no one could see you standing there, [MASK].
<name>Soda</name>	Soda	Nenny	You don’t pick your sisters, you just get them and sometimes they come like [MASK]. She can’t play with those Vargas kids or she’ll turn out just like them. And since she comes right after me, she is my responsibility.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Sally	It was her own fault too. When I got back [MASK] was pretending to be mad . . . something about the boys having stolen her keys. Please give them back to me, she said punching the nearest one with a soft fist. They were laughing.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Lucy	Then [MASK] screams to take our socks off and yes, it’s true. We have legs. Skinny and spotted with satin scars where scabs were picked, but legs, all our own, good to look at, and long.
<name>John</name>	John	Rachel	I sit on the back seat and [MASK] is skinny enough to get up on the handlebars which makes the bike all wobbly as if the wheels are spaghetti, but after a bit you get used to it. We ride fast and faster.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Earl	[MASK] is a jukebox repairman. He learned his trade in the South, he says. He speaks with a Southern accent, smokes fat cigars and wears a felt hat—winter or summer, hot or cold, don’t matter—a felt hat.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Davey	She is the one who told us how [MASK] the Baby’s sister got pregnant and what cream is best for taking off moustache hair and if you count the white flecks on your fingernails you can know how many boys are thinking of you and lots of other things I can’t remember now.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Yolanda	She stirs the oatmeal. Look at my comadres. She means Izaura whose husband left and [MASK] whose husband is dead. Got to take care all your own, she says shaking her head. Then out of nowhere: Shame is a bad thing, you know.
<name>Stars</name>	Stars	Butterflies	You can fall asleep and wake up drunk on sky, and sky can keep you safe when you are sad. Here there is too much sadness and not enough sky. [MASK] too are few and so are flowers and most things that are beautiful.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sally	The tilt-a-whirl. The red clowns laughing their thick-tongue laugh. Then the colors began to whirl. Sky tipped. Their high black gym shoes ran. [MASK], you lied, you lied. He wouldn’t let me go.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Minerva	Out the window and the door locked. But that night he comes back and sends a big rock through the window. Then he is sorry and she opens the door again. Same story. Next week she comes over black and blue and asks what can she do? [MASK].
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Kiki	And [MASK], who is the youngest, has hair like fur. But my mother’s hair, my mother’s hair, like little rosettes, like little candy circles all curly and pretty because she pinned it in pincurls all day, sweet to put your nose into when she is holding you, holding you
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Sally	[MASK] says she likes being married because now she gets to buy her own things when her husband gives her money. She is happy, except sometimes her husband gets angry and once he broke the door where his foot went through, though most days he is okay.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Lois	[MASK] who can’t tie her shoes. Where does he take her? Everything is holding its breath inside me. Everything is waiting to explode like Christmas. I want to be all new and shiny. I want to sit out bad at night, a boy around my neck and the wind under my skirt.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Nenny	I don’t care what kind I get. Just as long as 1 get hips. Everybody getting into it now except [MASK] who is still humming not a girl, not a boy, just a little baby. She’s like that.
