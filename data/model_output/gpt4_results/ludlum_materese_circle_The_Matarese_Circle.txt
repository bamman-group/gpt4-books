<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Winthrop	“If [MASK]’s still alive, he’ll be caged, trapped, held under a microscope. I won’t be able to get near him. They’d kill me on sight.” “Again, I agree. Are there others you trust that can be reached?”
<name>Reardon</name>	Reardon	Montefiori	As he held the flame to the tip of the cigar, he was annoyed to see that his hand trembled. “You’re sweating, [MASK].” The voice came from the shadows on the left. “The match shows up the sweat all over your face.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Antonia	[MASK] did as she was told, the rapid explosions of the machine gun filling the car. They reached the curve of the drive, the first descent on the hill. “Get over to the right window!”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Scofield	[MASK] watched her closely, saddened by what he saw. Beneath the ravaged face there had been a lovely face, the eyes once clear and alive, not floating in dead sockets as they were now. “I’m sorry. It must be painful to know that.”
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Crispi	[MASK] snapped his fingers for an inferior brother to show the couple to their table. “I shall hear you say it yourself momentarily. But first, have some wine, in case the sauce is not perfect!”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Scofield	There were no abrupt movements, no sudden jumping away from the light. The walk was casual, unobtrusive. He wondered if it was anyone he had trained. [MASK] appreciated professionalism; he would commend the man and wish him a lesser subject for surveillance next time.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Taleniekov	If he’d only had sleep, or if he had not gone through the totally unexpected violence of the old woman’s attack, or if [MASK] had not told him so much of the truth, things would be clearer.
<name>Renzo</name>	Renzo	Scozzi	whispered [MASK]. “Who are you, Pastor? Is the name to mean something to me? Pastor? Priest? Are you a high priest sent to test me?” The Italian’s voice rose stridently. “You talk of things buried in the past.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bray	“I have mixed feelings, but 1 don’t think I have to tell you that.” “No, sir, you don’t.” “So many things changed, didn’t they, [MASK]? The ideals, the opportunities to do so much for so many.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Taleniekov	“A prized weapon when obtainable.” He paused and added quietly. “I favor mine.” “Exactly. As the Magnum, Grade Four, is a favored weapon of another.” [MASK] stiffened. “Oh?”
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Antonia	They could not communicate directly; it was too dangerous. There had to be a third party, stationed in one spot, under cover, familiar with whatever basic codes they mounted— above all, secretive and accurate. Was [MASK] capable of being that person?
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Blackburn	“No.” The old man struggled to raise his head on the pillow. “No more than you were involved with [MASK]’s death. Don’t you see? They know everything; even of operatives whose skills are proven, but whose minds are tired.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Taleniekov	“Both cost money.” “My treat,” [MASK] said. It was the dinner hour. The huge reading rooms of the Saltykov-Shchedrin Library with their tapestried walls and the enormously high ceilings were nowhere near as crowded as usual.
<name>he</name>	he	Scofield	“Most of the time, they’re all we have.” The smile disappeared, replaced by a sadness [MASK] was not sure he understood. “There’s another thing.” “What’s that?” “You. I’ve watched you.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bray	Come here. Quickly!” The dog’s snarls came through bared teeth. Its head was thrust forward, its legs stretched and taut, prepared to defend or attack. Leaving the door open, [MASK] crossed to a counter and picked up a lettuce leaf.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Vasili	Where is the cable?” The cryptographer opened his hand. The paper was neatly folded, creased into his palm. “I wanted to be able to throw it away, if I had to. I know the words.” He handed the cipher to [MASK].
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Charlie	There’s no evidence to support an extortion theory, no family reported or referred to by the target at any time. He was a dedicated agent for Soviet intelligence.” “Evidence? Oh, come on, [MASK], even you know better than that.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Taleniekov	“To let one or the other of your governments put me away, until you have found the men you seek?” “I’m afraid that’s not possible,” said [MASK]. “We’re acting outside our governments; we do not have their approvals.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Winthrop	As always, [MASK]’s chauffeur spoke gruffly, not unpleasantly. “The Ambassador’s still at the White House; he asked me to come back here and wait for any calls from you. He told me to tell you that everything you asked for is being taken care of.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Guiderone	“They’re often interchangeable, aren’t they?” “They called you the Shepherd Boy.” [MASK] turned. “Yes, I know. It was only partially true. As a child I took my turn herding the flocks, but the occasions diminished.
<name>Angelique</name>	Angelique	Antonia	“What?” “I will not leave! You cannot force me to, you cannot send me away because it is convenient... or worse, because you pity me!” [MASK]’s dark Corsican eyes glistened again. “What right have you?
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Mouth	“[MASK]? His mouthT' “His head injuries were extensive, dozens of pictures had to be taken. There had to be a lot of projected dental work. Can you do it?” The young man nodded. “I think so.”
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Bray	Sequence. Progression. Further back? Ido not like answering this telephone. Words spoken firmly, almost angrily. That was it. Suddenly, [MASK] understood and the relief he felt was like cool water sprayed over a sweat-drenched body.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Crawford	There was a slight pause on the line; when [MASK] spoke, his brusque voice took on an added tone of weariness. “Those goddamned incidents have a way of following a man to his grave, don’t they?
<name>He</name>	He	Congdon	I think I know what the Soviets are capable of as well as any strategist in covert services. And for years I permitted those more aggressive voices to speak with authority. I understood the necessity. Did you think 1 didn’t?” “Of course not. I simply meant...” [MASK] hesitated.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Scofield	I’ll kill you!” The old woman stopped and lowered the knife. She stood motionless, speechless, breathing heavily, staring at him in a kind of ethereal disbelief. It occurred to [MASK] that she had never been in this position before; she had always won.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Scofield	[MASK] was safe; he could concentrate on his bill-of-particulars. By 4:35 in the morning, he had filled seventeen pages. Facts, conjectures, probabilities. He had written the words carefully, legibly, so they could be clearly reproduced.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Taleniekov	[MASK] threaded his way past rushing forklifts and crews of complaining laborers toward the huge cargo warehouse. Inside the enormous enclosure, the light was dim, the wire-meshed floods too high in the ceiling to do much good. Beams of flashlights crisscrossed the containers: men were checking numbers.
<name>David</name>	David	Julian	“There’s no reason for you to say anything, [MASK]—” “Stop it! ” The scream was released. “All right, no names. You know who I am—if you don’t, the Shepherd Boy hasn’t kept his son informed.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Appleton	He’s refused. Goodbye, Senator.” “No!” [MASK]’s breathing was audible. “All right, all right. You’ll be told a time and a location when you call the number I give you.” “I’ll be what?
<name>Remo</name>	Remo	Scofield	It’ll be interesting to see what—if any—his connections are to Trans-Comm.” “Can you doubt they exist?” “At this point I doubt everything,” said [MASK]. “Maybe I’ll think differently after we’ve put together those facts you say we now have.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Scofield	The girl had to go free. Were my reactions consistent with your well-known obstinacy?” “Very plausible,” replied [MASK]. “Let’s see if I can fill in a few spaces. You answered the questions: What was my mother’s middle name?
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Krupskaya	“Some targets simply aren’t feasible.” “Such approval was never sought in the past. [MASK] did not think it was based on feasibility.” “On what, then?” “Ultimate extortion.” “How were the contacts made with this council?”
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Winthrop	“May I ask why you’ve come to that conclusion?” “I don’t want him around personnel involved with covert activities. According to our latest information, he’s displayed hostile reactions to basic policy. He could be a negative influence.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Gregori</name>	Gregori	Bray	This was the gap that [MASK] could neither fill nor understand. The captain who had risked his life so frequently, so openly for the sake of other men; how could those risks be reconciled with a man programmed since birth to become the President of the United States?
<name>Thalric</name>	Thalric	Scozzi	In his lapel were tiny colorful ribbons, around his waist a thin gold sash, bordered in dark red and knotted off center. If any missed the significance of the ribbons, they could not overlook the mark of distinction inherent in the sash; [MASK] wore his escutcheons prominently.
<name>Harley</name>	Harley	Scofield	At least, that’s what I gathered from the other girls.” “‘Most of the risks ..repeated [MASK]. “‘Reduced to a minimum?”’ “Not all, of course, but a great many. It is very well organized.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Vasili	“I really don’t think this is necessary,” objected [MASK]. “I expected to make my own arrangements—for both our sakes.” “Whatever you might arrange, this is better; it will be daybreak soon and the roads are watched.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Taleniekov	ment was scrutinized and approved by the academicians! At the time." “One was bought. I grant you a great estate was burned to the ground, but that is the limit of existing proof.” [MASK] turned several pages back. “Look.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Aleksie	It never kills without leaving evidence—often the killers themselves—but it is never the right evidence, never the true killers.” “Men have been caught who pulled triggers, [MASK].” “For the wrong reasons. For reasons provided by the Matarese... .
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Bray	“As long as I care to remember and that is quite long enough, thank you.” [MASK] looked again at the decanters. “Has the Senator been here recently?” “Why do you ask?” She seemed amused. Or was she on guard?
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Scofield	I’ve got a little index file—three by five cards—where I jot down my goodies.” [MASK] spoke; he had to know. “What about Trans-Comm? Did you ever do a file card on it?” “Oh, sure.
<name>Ylla</name>	Ylla	Antonia	There are others, I’ll find them.” “I see.” [MASK] pressed her elbows into the bed, raising herself. “Just like that. I’m no longer needed?” “No.” “Why was I considered at all?”
<name>Spider</name>	Spider	Jimmy	“You’re a nutty boy-yo, you are.” “Hey, [MASK], I got this honkey friend on the horn here. He’s looking for information that goes back to when you were the terror of the angels’ dorm.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Taleniekov	Give your order.” She turned from him and shouted. “You men! Put up your guns! Hold your fire!” A single flashlight beam shot out and [MASK] saw what she did not see—and knew instantly what she did not know.
<name>John</name>	John	Bray	Goddamn it! He was going to! It had only been a matter of weeks'. “You are so far away.” “What?” [MASK] brought the glass to his lips; it was a reflex gesture for he had finished the drink.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Taleniekov	“The shot, people will have heard it! We’ve got to run! The police!” Several curious passersby stood motionless at the alley’s entrance, peering in. “Be quiet!” commanded [MASK]. “If anyone comes in use your KGB card.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Scofield	“Room six-twenty-six,” were the director’s first words when [MASK] placed his second, confirming call. “Just go right up on the lift as usual. You can sign the registration in your room—as usual.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Bray	Caught in the headlights were two men, weapons drawn, a third on the ground. [MASK]’s gun was in his hand; he dropped to the pavement and fired. One of the two men fell. The limousine completed the turn and roared out of the parking lot into the southbound road.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Taleniekov	They were tolerated—even made to feel important—as long as they were useful, eliminated the moment they were not.” “But useful for what? That’s the question!” [MASK] banged his glass down in frustration. “What does the Matarese want?
<name>Straker</name>	Straker	Jim	“Goddamn it,” said the President, “I don’t need that crap from you two. Give me facts. You first, [MASK]. Since you’re so sure of yourself, what have you come up with?” “A great deal.”
<name>the old man</name>	the old man	Verachten	The priest held his place, cradling [MASK]. “I was summoned years ago and I came. As my predecessors in this house I ask for nothing and I receive nothing.” The old man lowered his hands from his face, struggling to compose himself, nodding his trembling head; the priest released him.
<name>Disney</name>	Disney	Dickens	A dark Cadillac sedan turned the comer and crept past the carolers. The lead singer, dressed in a costume that was somebody’s idea of [MASK]’ Bob Cratchit, approached the right rear window, his gloved hand outstretched, his face contorted in song next to the glass.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Paolo	He pressed his way through the crowd in the entranceway and walked into a less-frenzied gathering in the next room. He saw her in the comer, the dark-haired [MASK] standing next to her, two other cavalieri in front, all vying for her attention.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Stanley	[MASK] was behind the wheel, gunning the motor, prepared to bolt out of the area. Whoever held the light was not going to allow that to happen. He wanted that car... and whoever was in that car.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Scofield	[MASK] carried the nurse into a small drawing room, bound her hands and feet in slipknots made from the tom nylon of her hose, saving the elastic waistband for a gagging brace, pulled between her teeth, tied firmly to the back of her neck.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Taleniekov	[MASK] crawled through the underbrush, elbows and knees working on the hard ground, pausing with every snap of a branch, blending what noise he made into the sounds of the night forest. He was within five feet, a spray of juniper between himself and the guard.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Charlie	His secret— or secrets—were found out. He was reached; it’s all through his dossier. He lived abnormally, even for an abnormal existence.” “We rejected that approach,” said [MASK] emphatically. “He was an eccentric.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Bray	[MASK] dropped to his knees, releasing his double-grip, and dove to his left out of the way. He scrambled to his feet, raced through the crowds to the comer and ran into the street, threading his way between the traffic.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Dimitri	“You haven’t seen each other in nearly two years.” “I’ve had my work, everyone knows that.” “You’re a scientist.” His wife squeezed [MASK]’s hand. “But not today. Not for the next three weeks!
<name>He</name>	He	Vasili	Thank you. You’ll hear from me.” [MASK] had not returned to his flat, but instead to his office. He had sat in the darkness for hours, arriving at his extraordinary decision. Hours before it would have been unthinkable, but not now.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Scofield	[MASK] took the steps rapidly, the guard’s revolver in his trouser pocket, his Browning strapped to his chest beneath his tuxedo. He walked through the French doors into a crowded room; it was the “courtyard” devoted anachronisti-cally to the crashing sounds of the disco beat.
<name>Carlo</name>	Carlo	Montefiori	Meet your boats in the harbor. If you don’t find the wood, look for a man with his hand blown off; he’ll have the money.” “It will be trapped?” asked [MASK] incredulously, the sweat drenching his shirt collar.
<name>Creighton</name>	Creighton	Bray	Or others. [MASK] ran up the path, keeping in the shadows as much as possible, slowing down to a rapid walk as he emerged on the plateau of terraces that fronted the final incline of steps into the villa itself.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Bray	He’s running down the hill.” “Come!” said the Russian, getting up, approaching [MASK]. “I know a dozen places to hide. I’ve got a great deal to tell you.” “You must have,” “I do.
<name>He</name>	He	Taleniekov	I have told you the truth, all of it. If you still have doubts, I cannot put them to rest. Again she had finished. [MASK] got up and walked slowly to the stove and the pot of tea.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Vasili	The Hollander in the black overcoat removed his gray homburg, as [MASK], his face briefly turned away, stood next to him against the paneled wall of the small enclosure. The doors closed. The girl laughed softly; her companion pressed the button for the fifth floor.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Bray	[MASK] tried to think back, tried to recall a cipher or a code that matched the digits, but there were none he could remember, and he doubted the KGB man would pinpoint his location. Five—Zero—Five. Five—Death—Five?
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Scofield	“There’s no time! There are men who want to kill you, but I’m not one of them! I’ve caught one, however; he’s with me now—” “You sent another,” interrupted [MASK]. “She’s dead.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bray	[MASK] had not objected; he had come out of the earth and found something very precious to him, something he had thought he had lost permanently. He could love again; the excitement of anticipation had come back. The sound of a voice stirred him, the touch of a hand was meaningful.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Antonia	All control left him; he raced across the wide avenue, speeding cars braking, spinning wheels, blowing horns. His thoughts converged like staccato shots of gunfire, one thought, one observation, more painful than all others. [MASK] looked more dead than alive.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bray	The older man stuttered, his eyes riveted on the gun, then ran to the phone. The performance was convincing, he was frightened out of his wits. [MASK] took the maroon-and-gold-striped jacket held out for him by the large subordinate.
<name>Bourne</name>	Bourne	Taleniekov	The words of a dying Is-trebiteli? A Communist killer? Where’s the verification, even the logic? Goddamn it, we’re cut off. All we’ve got are shadows!” [MASK] took a step forward, his conviction in his voice.
<name>She</name>	She	Scofield	Are you going to introduce yourself?” “I don’t think I’ll have to. Unless I’m mistaken, he’s looking for me.” [MASK] gestured toward a buffet table. “Let’s walk over to the end table, by the pastries.
<name>Adonis</name>	Adonis	Joshua	“Oh, no, that wouldn’t be right,” she said. “It’s very private. It’s his, and I’m the only one he lets in. He lives there still, you see. My beautiful [MASK].”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Taleniekov	“I was so worried that you wouldn’t!” [MASK] shut the door. “It’s not yet one o’clock,” he said, reaching for her hand. “1 thought you’d be asleep.” “I was hoping you’d realize that.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bray	He made a U-tum, pointing the car in the direction from which they came. Within thirty seconds another, larger automobile approached; it had picked them up along the way and had followed at a discreet distance. [MASK] knew what was expected; he got out, as did the West Indian.
<name>Franco</name>	Franco	Moscow	He let me find out for myself. I was sufficiently fluent in English and French then, reasonably so in Spanish. He opened the doors, literally opened the steel doors, of the forbidden books—thousands of volumes [MASK] disapproved of—and let me free with them.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Taleniekov	The old woman’s vacant yet powerful pale blue eyes held his; it was hard to accept the fact that she could not see. “It is in your voices,” she said. “You are afraid.” “Have we reason to be?” asked [MASK].
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Scozzi	We arrived here less than an hour ago and it’s been a little hectic. I would have recognized you, naturally, but I’m surprised you knew me.” [MASK] laughed, displaying teeth so white and so perfectly formed they could not possibly have come with the original machine.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Maletkin	“Goodbye,” he said closing the door. As he rounded the trunk of the automobile toward the path, he heard the sound of [MASK]’s window being rolled down. “It’s incrediblesaid the traitor, gratitude in his voice. “Thank you.”
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Antonia	“Organized? Escape? ...” Organized! That was it. Minimum risks, maximum returns! It was the pattern, the entire pattern. It went back to the beginning... to the concept itself. “[MASK], tell me, where did the contacts come from?
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Scofield	[MASK] shot out his right hand, catching the gun, pivoting as he did so, his left foot arching up viciously into the attacker’s groin. The man grimaced in shock and sudden agony; the gun fell to the floor, metal clattering against stone.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Vasili	He jabbed the fingers of his right hand into the man’s throat, bruising the windpipe. The gun fell to the floor, its clatter obscured by the din of the warehouse. [MASK] picked it up and shoved the CIA agent against a boxcar container.
<name>Bourne</name>	Bourne	Bray	Goddamn it, thought [MASK] angrily as he walked silently around the landing, had he forgotten that alerts had been sent to every station in the world by now? He was a fugitive and he had been careless. Where had he been picked up? In the Via Condotti?
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Scofield	I’ve got accounts there. If I do, count on three days, four at the outside. There are small inns up in the hills. I’ll find you....” [MASK] stopped. Both men turned swiftly at the sound of an approaching automobile.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Scofield	“It’s been eight or ten years, hasn’t it?” “At least,” agreed [MASK]. “How’ve you been?” “Still here. I’ll be pensioned off before too long. Looking forward to that.” “Enjoy it.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Antonia	But don’t you see? You can’t. Help us stop them, help me stop them. They’ve put you through so much ... make them pay for it, [MASK]. Goddamn it, get angry. I look at you and I’m angry as hell!”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Taieniekov	One volume would tell us exactly where to look.” “There’ll be something; there has to be.” [MASK] handed one book to the scholar and opened the second for himself. He began to scan the handwritten entries of ink, cautiously turning the brittle pages.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Taleniekov	“Is that why you went outside?” “No. I went outside to relieve myself; there’s no toilet here.” “I forgot.” “Did you hear me leave? Or return?” “Is that coffee?” “Yes,” answered [MASK].
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Russian	“Get up!” he ordered. She rose only partially, her knees pulled up under her, holding her neck. “You must tell me!” she whispered. “You know you can’t get out. Don’t be a fool, [MASK]!
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Congdon	The unit concentrated on a handful of scientists and soldiers and intelligence specialists. As it does today. That’s not what we began with.” “But as you pointed out, sir,” said [MASK], “the circumstances warranted the change.”
<name>Case</name>	Case	Taleniekov	There was a second gun- shot; the code man arched spastically, his legs together, an eruption of flesh at his throat. He had been shot through the back of the neck. [MASK] lunged to the floor of the hallway, stunned at what followed.
<name>He</name>	He	Bray	Only for an hour one night to pick up some things. So I took a room here and made it his. It will always be his, but he doesn’t know it.” [MASK] knelt down in front of her again.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Bray	A life was somehow covered in the display. [MASK] winced in the dim light. He was in the tomb of a man very much alive, the artifacts of a life preserved, somehow meant to transport the dead safely on its journey through the darkness.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Scofield	He was not; [MASK] walked out of the amphitheater into the widest path that led to the boulevard. He emerged on the pavement; the traffic in the street was constant, bright headlights flashing by in both directions, mottled by the winter mists that rolled off the water.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Scofield	He had found it. It was—naturally—on the front page, the headlines prominent, the copy written as much to evoke sympathy as to report the tragic death of a young man. [MASK] studied the story, positive that he would come to certain lines.
<name>Kerensky</name>	Kerensky	Kerenski	And, of course, the prince was marked by the Bolshe- viks for execution. His only hope was [MASK], who was too indecisive or corrupt to cut off the illustrious families so completely. That hope vanished with the collapse of the Winter Palace.”
<name>Trask</name>	Trask	Patelli	A sign on the table gave the man’s name. A. [MASK]. “That could be a while, pal! I got a thief on the phone. A fucking thief who says his fucking pansy drivers can’t roll because it’s wet out!”
<name>Bourne</name>	Bourne	Scofield	The nurse started to close the door. [MASK] jammed his left foot into the base, his shoulder against the heavy black panel, and forced it open. “I’m afraid you know who I am,” he said, stepping inside, dropping his attache case.
