<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Hath	And [MASK] had gotten out his dice, as he was sure to do when there was a question of who would pay a bill, or a dispute, or anything—“The dice you gave him, sir. He always had them handy in his pocket.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hath	When the time was almost spent he had suddenly thought of the present he had made to give his son; and he had got his toolbox from the hall and unwrapped the little pieces from a bit of oily cloth. “Why, Father—•” [MASK] turned them in his hands.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Madge	That’s really all there is to say about it. We’re going away together so we can be happy. I know it will be an awful shock to you and [MASK] but there’s nothing else to « 159 » do, and it isn’t wrong or sinful.
<name>John</name>	John	Nat	And at last the car had come; and his son had waved to him and called a cheery greeting, as he had used to do coming home from school in his vacation times. And [MASK] had shaken hands, smiling with level eyes.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Sam	She was helping in the kitchen for the Christmas holidays. “Why, [MASK]—” she said. Then, looking at him closely, “What’s the matter, honey?” “Nothing—■” “You been crying.— Did you fall and hurt yourself?”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Mitch	It’s horrible. It’s dreadful.” She was almost crying now. “Please put it back,” she begged. “Anything your little heart desires—” [MASK] picked up the eye and put it back. “I’m just being entertaining—”
<name>Miss Montague</name>	Miss Montague	Braden	He went in and inquired of a youth who was lounging in a chair with his feet cocked on a desk— “[MASK]?” The fellow took his feet down with an effort. “What does she do?” “She’s an actress, I believe.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Sam	And the customers, themselves, are getting wise to it. ‘Cut out the social stuff,’ I’ve heard ’em say, ‘and let’s get down to business: what’s the price and what’s the terms?’ ” [MASK] nodded.
<name>David</name>	David	Hath	And she said, evenly and quietly— “It’s because I’m Jewish, isn’t it?” He heard the door latch click, but he didn’t turn his head. “Because you were afraid that [MASK] and I—” She stopped.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Madge	She had finished the dress which was promised for today, hardly rising from her chair since early morning, and then had pressed it, keeping one eye on the stove, on which supper was cooking; and now she was folding it and [MASK] was helping her.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Sam	“[MASK], be a darling please and telephone my family, and be sure you explain that I’m not the least bit hurt—just a tiny little scratch that needs a stitch or two. And call me up sometime—” The ambulance had clanged away.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Madge	After dinner [MASK] had gone to some function at the church, and he was alone with them: his son and his son’s wife, more strange to him than strangers—with the yule log on the hearth and the portraits on the wall.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eileen	It had big black buttons for its eyes, and a pipe stuck in its mouth, and an old stovepipe hat cocked on its head. The unknown boy was arranging a broomstick for a staff, and [MASK] was standing back and looking on.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jules	You could hire men like that, better men than [MASK]; for ten thousand a year you could have your pick of them. But there seemed no path to that, unless—unless— He was thoughtful through the day, turning matters in his mind.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Daphne	For a moment he didn’t recognize her—it had been seven years; that time at the Plaza was the last, in the parlor full of flowers, listening to the story of how [MASK] met her death.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pa.	His coat rolled back when he pocketed the list, disclosing for a moment the nickel-plated star. “I guess they’ll tell you, [MASK]” “I guess they will.” “You better hurry now.” “All right.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Sam	His small slate-colored eyes were thrifty and suspicious, but worried, too, and eager. “Perhaps we could—•” It was hard for him to say. "Perhaps we could make some arrangement, [MASK]?” That’s how it had started.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jules	[MASK] groaned. He wasn’t broke, he said. There was merchandise on hand to cover all he owed and more than that, but he had no cash to pay his hills—just enough to meet his pay rolls for another week or two.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Sam	It had nothing to do with anybody else. It happened at that time, but that’s all there is to that.” “Sure, [MASK], I know.” “Just to keep the record straight” “Of course . . .”
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Mooney	“Here’s bottoms up to you.” [MASK] drained his glass. “Pretty goddam smart, I mean; and I ain’t kidding either. Say, you and me together would he a winning team. We could organize the country and clean up.”
<name>People</name>	People	Politicians	[MASK] never seem to understand this. At all events the problem is becoming serious, and added to it is the question of supplies: wire for the fences, already hard to get; and many tools and implements which are scarcer every day.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Madge	It was written with a pencil, barely legible, confused—as if she had been drinking— He thrust that thought aside. She had been sick of course— And poor old [MASK] had missed the boat, missed everything she wanted—a husband and a family.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Fie	[MASK] heard a telephone ringing remotely, and then the woman’s voice calling up the stair well, and a girl’s voice answer her, and the sound of clattering slippers on the stairs—then dragging up again. He waited by the door, not wanting to encounter anyone.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Hath	‘Well, bring them all.” And he had come—a little older, very much the same, cuffs as frayed as ever, quick-witted, sharp of tongue. He had made an instantaneous hit with [MASK], taking out his eye and handing it to him.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Air	They recognized him when he got out of the cab; he could see them nudging one another. And a girl called out to him—a red-cheeked girl in a tam o’shanter hat, “Hello, [MASK].
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Nelly	“You could come any Sunday, just drive over in a rig.” It was one of the reasons he had not gone home—had kept postponing it. He had no notion what to do with [MASK], and well-grounded apprehension of her economic reasoning.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Jules	[MASK] jumped out of his chair and began to stamp around. It would only be this way for a day or two, he said. Some printers had gone out, hut he had apprentices who were itching for their jobs and he’d break them in at once.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Madge	His room was comfortable: spacious and high-ceilinged, with those plaster curlicues where the chandelier had been; and rather nice old pieces of antique furniture: a table with a marble top, a dresser and a highboy, things [MASK] had picked up—and room to walk around them.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Neill	he yelled. [MASK] slammed the brakes, the tires screaming on the asphalt. One of them exploded and the auto lurched and swayed, almost turning over, skidding through the intersection, missing the phaeton by a hair, and crashing broadside on into the curb.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emilie	“Every word of it.” “Because—” She stopped, searching his eyes. “Because what, [MASK]?” “It wouldn’t be a joke—” “I love you,” he said. “I’m asking you to marry me.”
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Sam	She followed him a step, pleading with her eyes—like the words she had written in the telegram—"Could you possibly arrange—” “We must do something, [MASK]—” “Yes, well—” He fumbled with his coat.—We?—what did she mean by that?—Why had she sent for him?—what did she want?
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Hath	She had come down pretty hard, not breaking any bones but scratched and stunned. And [MASK] had carried her half a mile back to the house, storming at her furiously, and crying, too, with exertion and alarm— “You silly little fool, I told you not to do it.”
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Sam	“Yeh?” [MASK] was getting angry. “Well, what are you aiming at?” “I’m going to be a writer and an educated man. I’m going to write books—like my father used to do.”
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Schneider	“It’s not enough to rob them,” he shouted at the end, “but then you must insult them.” The bartender had stared with his fat jowls hanging loose, and [MASK] had finally turned his back and walked away, shrugging his shoulders and muttering to himself.
<name>James</name>	James	Madge	[MASK] had gone to meet them, and he had waited for them, pacing the drive in a fever of impatience. And at last the car had come; and his son had waved to him and called a cheery greeting, as he had used to do coming home from school in his vacation times.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Sam	"[MASK], please—” She motioned him to come and sit beside her, and he had come and sat there on the bed, reaching for her hands, bending down to kiss her. But she had held him back with her hands against his « 211 » breast, not pushing him away.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Wilfred	[MASK] smiled with lofty condescension. “I would say she was exhausted—I would say, completely spent—as limp as a rag, without a spark of life. She was born that way in fact. Why, I have to carry her through every scene.”
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Nelly	But he would get out of it, alleging some excuse of business to attend to. And one day it was [MASK] whom he said he must look up. “Would you like me to go with you?” “Well—” He hesitated.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Sam	[MASK] didn’t like it. Walking through the plant one day he saw a little boy fast asleep on the floor beside a stick box, his head not six inches from an idling belt. He woke him with his toe. “How old are you?”
<name>Grimes</name>	Grimes	Mooney	Well, there it is.” He leaned back in his chair with a sly grin on his lips. “I’m ready to talk business—• reasonably, you understand.” He nodded. It was plain enough: [MASK] was out to save his face.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Bojo	They called him [MASK]. He had been in the plant only a day or two; he couldn’t talk much English. He worked around the grounders, carrying pails of color. There was a bucket lying on its side in a pool of color.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jim	He had come from somewhere else and he agreed with [MASK] that the town was devoid of opportunity—“Deader than a mackerel,” as he put it. He pointed down the street to the stack of a steamboat tied up against the levee.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nat.—But	She shook her head. “If there was any question, your father should have come.” “My father is not fit to come,” she said. “Oh! I’m sorry, [MASK] I’m afraid there’s nothing to be done.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Madge	But at least he’d got her out of Shanty Town, decently installed in a comfortable home on the north side of the Square—the Elliott Wyatt house he had bought four years ago and given, in joint ownership, to [MASK] and to his father.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	George	“We haven’t any money.” ‘What’s that?” [MASK] said. ‘We haven’t anything to pay for board or lodging.” And it wasn’t an appeal, not tearful or defiant—just a statement of the fact.
<name>James</name>	James	Sam	I suppose he would come here if she were still here, [MASK].” He nodded. The palms of his hands were wet and he rubhed them on his knees. “I saw her on the street this morning—” She gathered up the faded blossoms in a scrap of paper.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	the ticket agent questioned. “As far as this’ll go,” [MASK] said and shoved his money underneath the wicket. “You ain’t particular,” the man grinned, checking the family with his eye. “I ain’t particular.”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Wilfred	“I begin to hope so, too, my dear young lady.” [MASK] smiled into the mirror. “For now I foresee a purpose in my presence, and a duty I shall cherish.” He handed her the script, a dog-eared volume.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Hath	But perhaps it wasn’t politics— “I’m afraid, dear, you can’t change him.” “No, probably.”—Thinking, with a start: why had [MASK] come home so quickly? That hadn’t been the plan.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Mitch	“But why?” he demanded. “I should think you’d had enough.” “I’ll tell you why,” [MASK] said, leaning with his elbow on the mantel and a highball in his hand.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nelly	In some strange way, for there was no resemblance, she had made him think of [MASK]. But there was something deeper gnawing at his heart, which he only partly sensed: he was really one of them, and he had been denied.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Sarah	She spoke with a soft drawl but not like the levee negroes. “I think you’ll like it once you’re settled down.” “I’m sure that we will,” [MASK] agreed. She spoke as she would to anybody, black or white; she had little color prejudice.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Jules	She didn’t mind the racket, the dirty, slippery floor, the smell of glue and color, the humid, stifling heat; she wanted to see everything and have it all explained. And she had talked with [MASK], shouting through the clamor.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	How naive!” She studied him a moment quizzically. “Why don’t you ask her, [MASK]?” “Ask her?” he repeated. “To marry you, or how she is, or something?” He stood there grinning foolishly.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Hath	But one reported that he had seen the plane close to the ground, and had seen it disappear in a sheet of flame and smoke from which he had not observed it to emerge. “Not so good,” [MASK] said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Tom	The old one was the kind that little children have—short and high above the ground and flimsy—good enough to sit on and be pulled around, but not suitable for coasting. [MASK] had a coaster—a long, low, sleek one, with shiny runners anchored to the frame.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hath	We’ll make a night of it, if you don’t mind sitting up?” “Oh no, I don’t,” he said. “Fine.” [MASK] grinned. “We won’t go to bed at all; we can do that any time.”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Emilie	Her skin was smooth and dark; she didn’t use cosmetics—didn’t even paint her lips which had color of their own—which made you think of velvet. Very feminine. A slender, graceful figure—almost fragile— “That’s all right, [MASK].”
<name>Arty</name>	Arty	Hath	“Well, let’s see what you can do.” “I don’t want to.”' “I’ll bet you could.” [MASK] edged away. “I’ll tell you what: I’ll give you a quarter if you make it.”
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Mitch	“No, not another one.” [MASK] paused to fill his glass. “But the same one going on—on and on and on till the issue shall be clear, clear to all the peoples of the earth.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mitch	‘Well, don’t get smothered with it.” “No—” He shook his head. “The way it’s going now, that isn’t likely.” “Swell,” [MASK] grinned. “It’s lucky that we met.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Sam	“—you’ve been so good to me. It’s all so wonderful.” “Aw, shucks—” he mumbled, fumbling with the key. “You’ll be proud of me some day. You won’t regret it, [MASK].”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nat	“Okay.—How’s the country gentleman?” “Fine.—Say, it’s good to hear your voice. When did you arrive?” “About an hour ago.” ‘Where’s [MASK]?” “Right here.” • “That’s great.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mitch	And then she said, half serious, but laughing, “Go on, quit picking on him.” “Quit picking on him?—Why?” “Because I like him, see?” He looked up with a start and met her eye, and then she looked away and back at [MASK].
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Jo	“Thanks, [MASK],” he said. “Oh, that’s all right. I thought you ought to know—” “Yeh, sure.” “If there’s anything that I could do—■” “Well, I don’t know.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Emilie	And then her eyes had opened and she had looked around, as if she didn’t quite know where she was— “Why, what—” “[MASK]! What is it, darling?” “Oh—” And then she smiled.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Spaulding	[MASK]’s jewelry store was on the comer. The thunderstorm was almost overhead; the sky was black, and big wet raindrops were splashing on the sidewalk. He went into the store. They were putting things away, spreading dust covers on the counters.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Emilie	They bought a stack of chips and he was showing [MASK] how to play roulette, when there was an altercation at a poker table in the back part of the room—someone accused of cheating, and some pretty ugly words which seemed about to resolve into a fight.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mike	But there’s just one thing about her—just one little thing. You might not believe it, looking at her, [MASK], but that brindle hitch won’t give a drop of milk.’ ” "Oh yeh?” The fellow looked a little sick.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Sam	“These guys around here think I’m pretty tough. They step lively when I bark; they like it, too. I don’t kid myself about my brains, but I can run a battery.” “I’ll bet you can,” [MASK] said.
<name>Butch</name>	Butch	Mike	[MASK] was his friend and would no doubt let him ride a time or two, but what use was that? The only way to coast was belly-whopper, and you had to have a whole sled to yourself.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Mitch	The boys were wild, he said; if [MASK] didn’t keep his mouth shut they would tar and feather him and run him out of town. “I guess that’s up to them—” He smiled, but it was past the point of being funny.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emilie	“No!” [MASK] cried. “You don’t mean that.” She took hold of his arm, pulling at his sleeve. “Think what you’re saying. You can’t do things like that. You can’t make people’s lives for them.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	She kept glancing round the room, calling his attention: “Look, [MASK], over there; I thinks that’s so-and-so.” And he would smile and nod, but the faces that he saw were unfamiliar.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Jules	“I will fire them tonight at quitting time.” “Is that the only answer you intend to give?” ‘That is my reply.” “Well, [MASK], I think you’re making a mistake.” “Mistake! But why?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	It was in the evening and there was no one in the room at the moment but themselves. “Say, [MASK]—” “What?” “Could you let me have another ten spot?” “What for?” “Well, I’m feeling pretty good
<name>Al</name>	Al	O’Gara	In fact he was afraid—afraid he wouldn’t look or act as city people did. And, too, he had formed a mental picture of [MASK]: a sporty looking fellow with a derby hat cocked over his eye and a big cigar gripped in his teeth.
<name>McTeague</name>	McTeague	Mitch	It was pennypushing stuff in which he had no interest. “I guess they’ll have to wait till [MASK] goes broke.” “That’s what I keep telling ’em, but they’re getting tired waiting.”
<name>Stuart</name>	Stuart	Sam	I would not debase myself.” “Well, what are you going to do?” “I will tell you, [MASK]: I am going to fire everyone who signed that thing.” And he fished in the basket for the fragment with their names.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Unkam	“If you’ll let me do it, [MASK]?” She took hold of his hand. “I can talk to him about it so he won’t be offended, so it won’t seem like charity but because I really want her.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Madge	He smiled about it now, thinking of himself as a number on a list—a long list, too. But [MASK] would never be convinced that he was not important. The pounding was disturbing—and workmen’s voices shouting, somewhere across the Square.
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Hath	At the end of the session, when the vase had been completed and was standing on the bench, his classmates stopped to look and to compliment him on it. Even the instructor had nodded curt approval. It had been a thrilling moment. He had made something for [MASK].
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Sam	"No sir—” [MASK] nodded with a feeling of relief. “And second—hum—” The old man seemed to drift away, to he dozing in his chair; then suddenly he roused and turned his shaggy head. “Telegraphy,” he said.
<name>Javert</name>	Javert	Jules	That’s the law.” “Bah!” And [MASK] had turned on him, mixing French and English as he did when he was angry. “It’s not enough to rob them,” he shouted at the end, “but then you must insult them.”
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Mitch	[MASK] was a little drunk; he kept singing the song about “working on the railroad” with words which he made up and which were not complimentary to that kind of occupation. In the lunchroom he took out his eye and made the waitress laugh, and even some trainmen who were eating at the counter.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Hath	“And you’ll look after them?” ‘Yes, I’ll look after them.” [MASK] kissed him. The mechanics didn’t look surprised, didn’t seem to think that it was funny. He swung into the cockpit, looking back.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Nat	“Oh—” he said. “I thought it was your father. Won’t you come into the dining room and have dessert with us?” She shook her head. “You wanted to see me, [MASK]?” “Yes.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clem	If you want to stay with me—well, you know I’m glad to have you. But if you can locate something you think is any better, I’ll he just as glad as you are.” “Gee, thanks, [MASK].”
<name>him</name>	him	Mitch	Perhaps they would have dinner, if she was not engaged; and, if she was—well, she might even break it. There must be something that she wanted to discuss. He could see [MASK] tomorrow—have lunch with him perhaps.
<name>Lenina</name>	Lenina	Hath	“You made them?—What?" “Yes—” And he explained about the factory and the school—the four hundred hours that were drawing to an end, feeling a little foolish and embarrassed, not quite understanding the expression in [MASK]’s eyes. 'Why?”
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Nelly	“Well, [MASK]—” He was being brisk and hearty, as healthy men incline to be in the presence of the sick. He stooped and kissed her forehead, and sat uncomfortably on a chair beside the bed. The adjoining beds were occupied; there was no privacy.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sam	“I think I’ll go downstairs,” he said, “and sit out on the porch.” “Yes, why don’t you, [MASK]. It’s such a lovely day.” She was turning back the bedclothes, tidying things.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nelly	“I’d sure be a sucker to believe that kind of stuff.” "Oh well—” [MASK] was hurt. “You’re just mad because she thought your suit was funny—” “Funny! My suit!” He stopped and stared.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hath	The afternoon sun was streaming through the window and she was sitting near it in a dressing gown. She didn’t look around when they came in. He waited for a moment, [MASK] standing there beside him, and then he spoke her name.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Eileen	He meant to be magnanimous. "You don’t?—That’s awfully sweet of you.” She was giggling again. “You see, I asked to sit by you—” “You did?” He felt relieved. Of course [MASK] had to humor her request.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Nick	The hrakeman’s name was [MASK]. He was young and less substantial, and a frequenter of poolrooms in his leisure. He had nothing much to do—no switching cars around, since the train departed backwards with the engine on the rear.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mike	“I was thinking I might buy a little stock. It’s pretty cheap right now.” “Uh-huh—” [MASK] nodded, swinging in his swivel chair. “The sweetest running business in the world—” “That right?”
<name>John</name>	John	Tom	“I was going to build a snow man in the yard.” “I’m sorry, dear. I meant to have [MASK] do it, but he got in and out before I caught him.” “All right—” He winked the tears back.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Mike	"Hell!” He laughed. “They might as well learn now to get along without me. The public owns the business and it’s up to them to run it.” “Sure,” [MASK] agreed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mitch	“Not unless I walk.” ‘Well say—” His voice was eager. “—you can spend the night with me. I’ll be off at six o’clock. We can have supper, [MASK], and take in the theater, eh?”
