<name>He</name>	He	Corlay	That was more than some families were able to do. He carried the second notebook over to the window. He felt he needed some more fresh air to help him finish this job. So [MASK] would not be content. . . .
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Kerdnor	What the devil was that message for me, again?" [MASK] repeated it slowly. “She was going to see this ‘him’ and give ‘him’ the message, and perhaps shelter with ‘his’ sister before continuing the journey.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Myles	The boy tried to catch his arm. “Not that way. This way.” He pointed again. “It’s all right, sonny. We’re friends,” [MASK] was saying. “We only want to thank your sister.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Plehec	He sat down heavily, straddling it, with his arms and chin resting on the high back. “It just needed that,” [MASK] said as if to himself in his thin light voice. When he was excited the lisp was more noticeable as he hurried his words.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Heame	Your —your friends have brought you on a hopeless hunt: there’s no game here for them. I’ve seen to that already. How long are you staying?” “Until tomorrow. I must be back then.” The men were almost level with [MASK] now.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Heame	“He did.” She watched him curiously. “Better come and finish your breakfast. Then you can sleep upstairs.” [MASK] came back to the table. There was still one important thing to ask. “Have you had any visits from the Bodies?”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Heame	[MASK] suddenly wondered if a direct path led from the well down to the shore. If there was one, they’d have to pass its mouth, and that wouldn’t be a pleasant two minutes. If there was one . . . There was.
<name>he</name>	he	Jean	“I can’t eat any more,” she answered. “If you want to get dressed before [MASK] leaves, you ought to finish your breakfast quickly.” He wondered whatever had given him the first impression that she was a simple creature.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Myles	“You stay here, well in the shadow of this tree. I’ll have a look.” “Sure.” [MASK] sat down thankfully. His voice was cheery enough, but there was a drawn look in his face.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Heame	[MASK] slowed his pace. “You’ve a heavy load, there,” he said. The woman gave a final heave to the basket, settling it as comfortably as it was possible between her shoulders. The black blouse was threadbare and sewn into a patchwork of mends.
<name>Mrs. Hall</name>	Mrs. Hall	Albertine	And then I’ll walk in the fields for half an hour. And then I’ll come in for supper. And then I’ll go back to bed.” [MASK] seemed to find this reasonable if unnecessary. She seemed relieved by the quietness of his voice.
<name>he</name>	he	Heame	That wasn’t so surprising, thought [MASK]. With his face streaked with sweat and dust, his clothes muddied and crumpled and tom, he would have passed for an oyster gatherer. And the guards must know the woman and child by sight.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Heame	The man’s eyes were so deep a brown in color that some of the pigment from the iris seemed to have spilled over and turned the white into yellow. Above the eyes, the forehead was high and slanting, the hair was dark and receding. The sallow face was watching [MASK] with distrust.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Heame	His mouth twisted bitterly as he laughed at himself. “But three days ago is three days ago.” He looked at [MASK]. “Damn you,” he said abruptly. “Why did you have to be right?” He limped towards the passage.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Albertine	Don’t worry, and you’ll be completely cured. Just rest and quiet.” He shook his head sadly, lifted the heavy bag from the chest, and followed [MASK] out of the room. He was still talking of rest and quiet as they went slowly downstairs.
<name>Uncle Andrew</name>	Uncle Andrew	Basdevant	“Dry your clothes on that line,” [MASK] said as he picked up a smoke-blackened pan from the table and set its chain handle on a hook over the glowing log. He was pointing to a dirty piece of rope which was stretched across the front of the stone mantelpiece.
<name>the trenches</name>	the trenches	Anne	Yes, they were made, and he wasn’t going to let anything change them, either. On Friday he would leave. Not tomorrow, but the next day he would leave. He looked again at [MASK]. How long, he wondered, before this bloody war was over?
<name>him</name>	him	Heame	They remained motionless there for two minutes—time enough for [MASK] to feel foolish at the way he had underestimated the boy. Strange, what wild ideas came to you when you found yourself out of your own particular field, as if you instinctively feared others’ judgments.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hearne	That was what he had copied. Grand ideas he liked. Grand ideas . . . The phrase haunted [MASK]. He shook himself free of speculation and went back once more to the books. The beginning of the riddle would be solved with them, he felt.
<name>John</name>	John	Gestapo	There are Germans in the village. The soldiers are coming here in some numbers tomorrow, but there are others already in the hotel. They probably call themselves a Commission for Economic and Educational Understanding. I think [MASK] is simpler to pronounce, don’t you?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Heame	[MASK]’s earnest eyes waited. Black hair, he was noting; brown eyes; mole on left cheekbone; heavy eyebrows; tanned skin; long upper lip; undistinguished nose and chin. It was a pleasant enough face, except when the eyes were wary and the lips were tautened.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jules	Who was this? The windows were too high for the men to see what was happening in the street. [MASK] and two others moved quickly over to the door. They had just reached the three stone steps which led up to it. The door opened.
<name>he</name>	he	Heame	They stopped talking as [MASK] was marched past. He didn’t look at them. But he knew they were still watching him as he was led into the group of buildings on the opposite side of the market place to the hotel.
<name>Lyddie</name>	Lyddie	Heame	“What do they take us for, anyway? As if we didn’t know camouflage when we saw it!” The woman nodded, but said nothing, and bent to pick up the basket again. “I can take it this time,” [MASK] said.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Corlay	I’m a jealous kind of chap. I worried about you being engaged to [MASK]. You aren’t the kind of a girl to let herself get engaged to a man without having liked him enough at one time.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Michel	She bowed and smiled gravely, with that dignity of the Celt which is so unexpected and yet so natural that you are surprised at your own surprise. She pulled the basket over the worn threshold, and smiled good-by as she pulled. [MASK] was already inside.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Heame	“Amusing, isn’t it?” he said in excellent French. “But not all my visitors are obliging enough to choose that chair.” [MASK] nodded. He was annoyed, and yet more relieved than annoyed, that he should have furnished the Nazi with some amusement.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Hearne	And the moon was young enough not to illuminate the whole place in efficient floodlighting. "But just where do we go from here?” [MASK] said to himself. They must reach solid ground again before daybreak: apart from the matter of light, there was also the tide to guard against.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Hearne	Her voice was too casual, but the kiss she gave him was meant to soothe any doubts. “And one more thing, my sweet, have you still got those lists?” [MASK] remembered the map, and the list of names and addresses, and the connecting numbers.
<name>Mr. Moto</name>	Mr. Moto	P16hec	Like [MASK], the lines in his face were more finely drawn, and the shadows under the half-veiled eyes were deeper. As he recognized the Englishman, his smile changed from politeness to pleasure. But he said nothing. He pointed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Heame	But her voice was kindly, and her eyes laughed at [MASK]’s expression. “Cheer up,” she said, "I don’t blame you for getting angry with me. You don’t know my little ways. Take your money before I change my mind!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Myles	“He may smuggle a lot of things in here, by his boat. He seems to enjoy poaching. He may even—” He paused. The room below was silent. There might have been a movement at the foot of the stairs. [MASK] had noted it, too.
<name>spy</name>	spy	Corlay	The captain’s voice, speaking in German now, carried farther than he had intended. Or perhaps he thought that this man [MASK] wouldn’t know much German, anyway. “. . . set a Frenchman to catch a Frenchman,” he was saying.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Heame	Her husband had been killed, she had said simply. In the war, [MASK] had guessed, for when she saw his stained tunic and battered cap, she had given him shelter at once. Another barge was slipping into its place beside the woman’s.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Heame	He only hinted. . . . And I said I would keep everything secret, as his friend.” “He was right to ask you not to tell,” [MASK] said. “And don’t tell anyone else.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jules	Seven feet away, he calculated. “Let’s go,” he said. He threw the glass of spirits at the sergeant’s eyes, and dropped to the floor. [MASK] and his friend had moved even as he threw.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Heame	They drifted towards the long gray curve of sand, growing grayer and wider. Behind it was a stretch of soft darkness. Golf courses, [MASK] remembered from his map. Miles of them. This was the place. Their speed slackened still more, they were almost drifting in.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Myles	“And so,” he continued, as they held a dark gray blanket round them with one hand and ate the fish with the other, “and so, you are English?” “American,” [MASK] said quickly.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Albertine	He turned away from the window. [MASK] would soon be back, and he ought to finish his inspection. There was still the third room on this floor. The door beside the carved wooden bed must lead to it. He started wearily towards the door.
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Albertine	There was a curious blend of familiarity and deference, a kind of proprietary interest mixed with critical pride. [MASK] had turned away as she asked the question. She was now stirring the contents of the large black iron pot suspended from an iron hook over the burning end of the log.
<name>person</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	person (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Corlay	What has happened to you?” But he was damned if he was going to fall on his knees and plead with her as the emotional [MASK] probably would have done. Her eyes wavered, and then she walked to the window. She had made her decision.
<name>Mrs. Barry</name>	Mrs. Barry	Albertine	She laughed in spite of herself. He caught her arm again and swung her round on the path. “Home, this time,” he said. “[MASK] will begin to get her suspicions aroused, too. And two women are enough in one secret.
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Heame	“Something useful for you to do. Very useful, if anyone should come in.” [MASK] smiled and rolled up his sleeves: first oyster gatherer, now pea sheller and potato peeler. It was all in the day’s work.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Heame	The smell of fish is stronger.” [MASK] nodded. He put his elbows on the counter of the bar, and leaned forward so that his face was no more than a foot across from the woman’s. She wasn’t so old as he had thought.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Heame	As the boy turned his head to answer the American, [MASK] opened the door. The noise inside the little room with its four marble-topped tables, its dark wood counter, its brightly colored calendars and paper flowers on the walls, ceased abmptly.
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Kerdnor	There had been people crowding slowly towards the steps. . . . [MASK] had pulled him into the shadow of the tower, had opened that small door in its base. Then there had been darkness, and the sound of bells and the chanting of a choir had grown more distant.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Etienne	For the second time that night he was thankful for the medieval mind and its love of mysteries. Perhaps it had been the repression of the Middle Ages, its secret opposition to authority, which had created these ingenuities. [MASK] led a careful way through the wooded grove, sloping inevitably towards the sea.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Henri	That certainly stopped the argument he could feel brewing. But what on earth was she staring at? As he walked up to the field, he was still wondering. [MASK] had left the spade stuck into a ridge of earth. There was another implement, too.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Madame	He’ll catch up with her on the Grande-Rue, and if [MASK] of the long tongue from next door was watching to see anything she could see—for her eyes are as sharp as her tongue is long—she will be disappointed.”
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Albertine	“If they see me digging potatoes, they may let me go on digging potatoes so that they can get them.” “There’s someone on the path, now,” the American interrupted. But it was [MASK], walking quickly up the hill towards them.
<name>District Two</name>	District Two	Dol	But it is I who work.” “And just what gives you the impression that you work more than I do? Just what makes you think [MASK] should be so much more important than other districts?” “You must come and visit me some day.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hearne	[MASK], looking quickly over his shoulder, noticed that behind them was a similar recess through which they had entered. It seemed as if there might have been a small gateway through the ramparts at this point once; as if it had been blocked up, but not with the same thickness as the walls themselves.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Corlay	He had to know what [MASK]’s game had been. Then either he could stuff the diary and papers back into their hiding place and forget about them, or—and Heame drew a deep breath—they might prove to be something much more than interesting.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Heame	That silenced the thin face opposite him. It was [MASK] who had to speak first, after that. He said casually, “I suppose all this preparation is for attack?” The man looked quickly up at him. “Why do you ask?”
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Breton	The voice was urgent, and it was [MASK]. A dimmed torch searched the room anxiously. “Here,” he croaked and put out an arm to the two figures in the doorway. “Here.” “Quick.” He needed no more urging.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Heame	[MASK] looked, but there was nothing but blackness, perhaps at the most a faint smudge of gray where the sand of the bay swept out to the sharp teeth of the rocky peninsula. There was no doubt about that spine of rock.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Myles	As a newspaper man, you are a trained observer. The things you would automatically notice during your journey here would be interesting and perhaps useful to the right people.” There was a pause, and then [MASK] answered, “I guess they would.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hans	Use any means in dealing with them. [MASK] said you could have a very free hand, but try persuasion first. Co-operation makes things much easier for us than suspicion and hate, so have patience at first.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Anne	“Can’t you say [MASK] is betrothed to you? Can’t you—” She halted. Possibly the words had sounded more distasteful than the impulsive thought. When wild ideas surged through your mind, you couldn’t often tell how cheap they were until you put them into a sentence.
<name>Dr. Roylott</name>	Dr. Roylott	Pierre	“Do you hear that?” she began. “It's [MASK]. He’s running. I told you you would be too late. Get back to your room, quick. I’ll think of something else to help you. Quick.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	PMhec	It cut through his head like a saw. “Any guess?” he asked [MASK]. “—Why they were here? Oh, just the usual: they come to look us over about once every week.” “You know them by sight?”
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Heame	They seemed a ghost and its shadow. No one had been on the path. That, [MASK] had verified. The danger point was passed. Their speed increased. Three hundred feet ahead of them was the northwest promontory of the island with a chapel on its rocks.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Hearne	The engine was suddenly silent, and the pilot waved a bulky glove. “That is when you get ready,” he had told [MASK] cheerily, over their last cup of hot chocolate. “Second time I wave is good-by and good luck.”
<name>George</name>	George	Sam	[MASK] would see that that young man did rest up. Yes, they were a strange couple, all right, each of them thinking he was responsible for the other. That way, even with the odds against them, they might have a chance.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Etienne	“And you should eat some more too. There’s little to offer you but scraps. But even the best people are eating pot scrapings these days.” He and [MASK] sat down at the wooden table with its clutter of dirty plates and emptied pots.
<name>him</name>	him	Etienne	He pointed to [MASK]. “And who’s this supposed to be?” “He’s my informant. You could do with one yourself, couldn’t you?” The savage sneer, the authoritative tone, had some effect, but not enough.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Matthews	Strange bird, [MASK]; he sort of sensed things coming. He’d cook up some plan, keep it simmering until the right moment arrived, and then dish it up piping hot. The right moment in this case had been a week before the French-German armistice.
<name>she</name>	she	Albertine	He was still talking of rest and quiet as they went slowly downstairs. When she returned, [MASK] found him staring at the window. “I’d like it open,” he said. “But you will catch a cold.” “I’d like it open.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Heame	The crossbar inside had fallen of its own weight and held it secure. To the south of them was the square, and the movement of people grouping under its trees. Harder boots struck the pavement, round the corner from where they lay. Patrol or sentries. . . [MASK] didn’t care.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Elise	For when these seven days were over, he might find little time free for himself and his work. Then he would simply have to seize any chance he could: for with [MASK]’s unexpected demands there would be an end to systematic observation.
<name>Bonaparte</name>	Bonaparte	Corlay	“If [MASK] comes back after peace—” “Then he will reform with great sincerity to live up to the character you have left for him, as soon as he finds it gives him enough esteem and power. That’s all he wanted, anyway.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Heame	She laughed suddenly at the seriousness of his face, and then became dutifully grave. “You must take care, yourself,” she answered, and for a moment [MASK]’s breath stopped. “We all must take care near this place,” she added, nodding over her shoulder at the hotel.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pierre	Get back to your room, quick. I’ll think of something else to help you. Quick.” [MASK] burst into the room, incoherent in his excitement. They understood the reason for it when they at last could make sense of his news.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Heame	She had even insisted on leaving money to pay for the food she had had. She wanted to go away at once, it seemed, because otherwise she couldn’t reach the coast in time. [MASK] rose, and walked across to the fireplace.
<name>Harold's</name>	Harold's	Jean	Last night, she told me that perhaps you could use [MASK]’s permit, if we could change the age in it from eighty-two to thirty-two. I think I can do that, all right.”
<name>She</name>	She	Anne	Strange how an intelligent man could always admit his own change of faith, and feel honest and brave about the admission, and yet could go on distrusting any change professed by another man. [MASK] shook her head slowly. She seemed to be fumbling for words.
<name>probably</name>	probably	Hearne	Doctors were doctors. He groaned slightly and twisted his body as his eyes opened. The doctor was shaking his white head and saying, “Very fast.” Considering the emotions he had caused, it would have been difficult to have found a normal pulse, [MASK] thought.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Albertine	“It’s nice to relax,” he said. It was true: for the last ten minutes, he hadn’t even thought of a bloody Nazi. [MASK] said, “Get those clothes off, and I'll wash them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Heame	[MASK] let the basket slide off his shoulders and straightened himself, painfully. Houses all around them, two- and three-storied houses, so that they seemed to be in a maze of man-built canyons. He hesitated.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henri	“[MASK] can dig for potatoes another day. This morning he is in the village, and he is going to find out for us if the Germans are going to stay there, or if they are just passing through. If the potatoes worry you.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Hearne	The village is being made ready for them. Half of them are to be garrisoned in the empty houses or billeted with families. The rest are to be together on the meadows beside the church.” [MASK] nodded. “Trees there,” he said.
<name>René</name>	René	Heame	Only when assured German footsteps sounded on the stone of the street and its steps would he halt [MASK] with his calm grip, guide him unhurriedly and cleverly into deeper shadows, into the labyrinth of passages and alleyways which crisscrossed the Grande-Rue.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Heame	“That’s a good name.” [MASK] turned to the woman, who was now listening with a half-smile. “How is the price of oysters today?” “Bad. But it keeps us alive.”
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Anne	The officer bringing up the rear also halted and looked round, and then waved in turn. Urgently. The rifle shots were coming nearer now. A machine gun crackled on this side of the town, too. The rifle shots were coming nearer. “Go on, darling,” [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Albertine	It would be nice to know just what he had seen as he had traveled through that very interesting piece of countryside in the last few weeks. If he would talk, it would be useful. If he would talk. [MASK] said, “He can hide in the straw in the shed."
<name>Corlay</name>	Corlay	Heame	That had been [MASK]’s advice. He had also stipulated that, if by some stroke of bad luck or piece of carelessness they were intercepted, the American must then forget he had ever seen the Corlay farm. He would have to produce his own story.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henri	He gave her a cheery wave, before he bent over a neat row of potatoes once more. The second time she gave a small wave back. It was hot now, for the sun was directly above him. Soon it would be time for dinner, and [MASK]’s return.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Heame	Two officers, [MASK] could see, but that was as far as he could identify them at this distance with the tree shadows blotting out the steps as they did. A high-pitched voice was saying . . fantastic.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Kerenor	Even after the last vague attempt to free herself from the death grip, even after the frenzy of her struggles had given way to limpness, [MASK] still held her crushed in his hands. The coat slipped from her bare shoulders.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Basdevant	He had reached the foot of the stone steps. “Throw a knife someonel” yelled the American, and flung the broken bottle at [MASK]; it struck the back of his shoulder, but the gash didn't stop him.
<name>Corlay</name>	Corlay	Hearne	Alert, but tactful. He was pretending to be interested in the newcomers, and only a shadow of a smile twisted the comer of his mouth. [MASK] turned quickly to the two Englishmen and spoke in his own voice: there was no need now for his Corlay imitation.
<name>The Doctor</name>	The Doctor	Anne	“[MASK],” he said, ‘Tm sorry if I hurt you. You’re kind and you’re brave. But you don’t know what you are letting yourself in for, if you were to travel with me, or even be found with me.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Heame	This was the first time that [MASK] disagreed with him. And then he remembered that compared to these two men he was fresh and rested. He could only make a guess at how far they had traveled and under what conditions.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Hearne	“How long must we wait for the food?” [MASK] took off the cook’s cap and walked silently to the screened restaurant door. By standing at the side of it and gently moving the pleated curtain half an inch, he could see well enough into the front room.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Myles	“There are enough blankets, anyway. We have thirty-six hours for sleep. That should be enough.” He yawned loudly. [MASK] finished arranging his clothes and his boots. He looked towards the door and pointed silently. One eyebrow was up.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anne	Can’t you—” She halted. Possibly the words had sounded more distasteful than the impulsive thought. When wild ideas surged through your mind, you couldn’t often tell how cheap they were until you put them into a sentence. [MASK] was looking at her in bewilderment.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Heame	“Why, he feels as we do.” [MASK] was thoughtful. The Breton priests had the reputation of being brave men. Few of them were given to equivocation and appeasement. They belonged with the people; but he wanted to be quite sure.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Hearne	He paused and listened. “If you don’t mind, I’ll go and see how his nibs is, now.” He slipped noiselessly into the further darkness of the trees. [MASK] grinned to himself. And what had happened to the train, he wondered.
<name>he</name>	he	Basdevant	He ostentatiously removed his penknife, his few francs, and the map. He opened it up to dry it, so that [MASK] could see what it was. But he remained standing at the side of the fireplace, watching the oil crackle in the heated pan.
<name>Klaus</name>	Klaus	Traube	“He’s behaving strangely. Doesn’t like taking orders.” “So.” [MASK] glanced nervously at his companion, as if asking for help. The other German poured himself some more wine. “I had noticed that,” he said in his precise voice.
