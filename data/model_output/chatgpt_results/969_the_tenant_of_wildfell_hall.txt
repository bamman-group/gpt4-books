<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Milicent	‘There is no one here but [MASK], and she—’ ‘Oh, I shall be delighted to watch you!’ cried our mutual friend. ‘Two such players—it will be quite a treat! I wonder which will conquer.’ I consented.
<name>him</name>	him	Rachel	But he had not power to form the letters. ‘In that case, you must be too ill to see the child,’ said I; and finding me inexorable, he at length managed to ratify the agreement; and I bade [MASK] send the boy.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Alice	At first he addressed me as the nurse, but, on my crossing the room to draw up the window-blinds, in obedience to his directions, he said, ‘No, it isn’t nurse; it’s [MASK]. Stay with me, do!
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Arthur	But oh! for the time when we shall be always together, and can exchange our thoughts without the intervention of these cold go-betweens, pen, ink, and paper! * * * * * 22nd.—I have had several letters from [MASK] already.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Helen	After staring a moment in mute surprise, she said,—‘Well, [MASK], I suppose I ought to congratulate you—and I am glad to see you so happy; but I did not think you would take him; and I can’t help feeling surprised that you should like him so much.’
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Milicent	Marriage may change your circumstances for the better, but, in my private opinion, it is far more likely to produce a contrary result.’ ‘So thinks [MASK]; but allow me to say I think otherwise.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Hattersley	‘Well, don’t squeeze my hand so frantically, and don’t agitate me so, for heaven’s sake! Oh, [MASK]! you were right: this woman will be the death of me, with her keen feelings and her interesting force of character.
<name>Mr. Lawrence</name>	Mr. Lawrence	Rose	My second was to bring him a book, which, knowing his mother’s particularity, I had carefully selected, and which I submitted for her approbation before presenting it to him. Then, I brought her some plants for her garden, in my sister’s name—having previously persuaded [MASK] to send them.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Helen	You’re not afraid of her, are you, [MASK]?’ he asked, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. ‘Of course not,’ I answered: ‘why should I? And who besides?’
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Arthur	I must see [MASK] to-night, and speak to him; but I would do it calmly: there should be no scene—nothing to complain or to boast of to his companions—nothing to laugh at with his lady-love.
<name>Lionel</name>	Lionel	Annabella	My senses seemed to fail me, but still I saw his shadowy form pass before me, and through the rushing sound in my ears I distinctly heard him say, as he stood looking up the lawn,—‘There goes the fool! Run, [MASK], run!
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Hattersley	‘Speak up, sir; they can’t hear you. Did I grant your request? ‘You did not.’ ‘No, I’ll be sworn she didn’t,’ said [MASK], ‘or he’d never look so black.’
<name>Beau Brummell</name>	Beau Brummell	Helen	But I have sometimes frequented the gaming-houses just to watch the on-goings of those mad votaries of chance—a very interesting study, I assure you, [MASK], and sometimes very diverting: I’ve had many a laugh at the boobies and bedlamites.
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Helen	He continued lounging on the sofa, and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch and at me, till bed-time, when I rose, and took my candle and retired. ‘[MASK]!’ cried he, the moment I had left the room.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Rachel	I mean, however, to make the experiment next Sunday, and oblige myself to leave him in charge of [MASK] for a few hours. It will be a hard task, but surely no imprudence; and the vicar has been to scold me for my neglect of the ordinances of religion.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rose	After his customary cheerful and fatherly greeting of [MASK], who was rather a favourite with the old gentleman, he turned somewhat sternly to me:— ‘Well, sir!’ said he, ‘you’re quite a stranger.
<name>George</name>	George	Arthur	Poor, blinded fool that I was to be so happy! I could now see the reason of [MASK]’s strange reception of me in the shrubbery; the burst of kindness was for his paramour, the start of horror for his wife.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Annabella	Don’t you envy me, dear?’ ‘No, love,’ said I—‘or him either,’ I mentally added. ‘And do you like him, [MASK]?’ ‘Like him! yes, to be sure—over head and ears in love!’
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Lawrence?—you	May I keep this letter, [MASK] see she has never once mentioned me throughout—or made the most distant allusion to me; therefore, there can be no impropriety or harm in it.’ ‘And, therefore, why should you wish to keep it?’
<name>money</name>	money	Wilmot	You’d have done a deal better if you’d taken [MASK], I can tell you; but that you won’t believe. At your time of life, it’s love that rules the roast: at mine, it’s solid, serviceable gold.
<name>Miss Dartle</name>	Miss Dartle	Eliza	Indignation kept me silent. At such a time and place I could not trust myself to answer. ‘Have you never observed,’ said [MASK], ‘what a striking likeness there is between that child of hers and—’
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Helen	‘Will you oblige me, [MASK]?’ continued she. Her impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the library. She closed the door, and walked up to the fire. ‘Who told you this?’ said she.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Huntingdon	‘No, no, let her be; there’s much to be said on both sides, and, now I think upon it, [MASK] often regrets that you are not more like her, scoundrelly dog that he is, and you see, after all, you can’t reform him:
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Helen	‘Can’t bear what?—to be reminded of the promises you have broken?’ ‘[MASK], you are cruel. If you knew how my heart throbbed, and how every nerve thrilled through me while you spoke, you would spare me.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Helen	he muttered. ‘I would leave you to-morrow,’ continued I, ‘and never again come under this roof, but for my child’—I paused a moment to steady, my voice. ‘What in the devil’s name is this, [MASK]?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	‘You should not let it worry you so much, [MASK],’ said he; ‘I will be more cautious in future; and in time—’ I did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Helen!—most	Think! it is a serious thing.’ ‘I should be proud to do it, [MASK] happy—delighted beyond expression!—and if that be all the obstacle to our union, it is demolished, and you must—you shall be mine!’
<name>Cathy</name>	Cathy	Helen	‘I can feel for anyone that is unjustly treated,’ I replied, ‘and I can feel for those that injure them too.’ ‘Why, [MASK], you are as jealous as he is!’ cried he, laughing still more;
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Helen	The young ladies had ceased to be afraid of him, and were beginning to think him quite interesting; but the mammas were still unrelenting. It was about this time, [MASK], that my good angel brought me into conjunction with you; and then I had eyes and ears for nobody else.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lawrence	I gasped. ‘Who betrayed her?’ ‘She went of her own accord.’ ‘Impossible, [MASK]! She could not be so frantic!’ exclaimed I, vehemently grasping his arm, as if to force him to unsay those hateful words.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Gilbert	‘Oh, [MASK]! how could you do so? Where have you been? Do come in and take your supper. I’ve got it all ready, though you don’t deserve it, for keeping me in such a fright, after the strange manner you left the house this evening.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Hattersley	The sufferer was fast approaching dissolution—dragged almost to the verge of that awful chasm he trembled to contemplate, from which no agony of prayers or tears could save him. Nothing could comfort him now; [MASK]’s rough attempts at consolation were utterly in vain.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Markham	You see I know the address, and I might write to her myself, but I am so virtuous as to refrain.’ ‘Well, I’ll do this for you, [MASK].’ ‘And as soon as you receive an answer, you’ll let me know?’
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Helen	‘But I have, you know,’ returned he, with peculiar emphasis. ‘That is nothing to me, sir,’ I retorted. ‘Is it nothing to you, [MASK]? Will you swear it? Will you?’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lawrence	‘Well, but [MASK] is a good rider; it is not likely he would fall from his horse at all; and if he did, it is highly improbable he would break his bones in that way. It must be a gross exaggeration at least.’
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Rose	‘Oh, I never thought of this!—And so they dare to turn my friendship into food for further scandal against her!—That proves the falsehood of their other lies, at all events, if any proof were wanting.—Mind you contradict them, [MASK], whenever you can.’
<name>St. John</name>	St. John	Arthur	‘I don’t understand you, [MASK] (at least I hope I don’t): pray tell me what I have done or said amiss.’ ‘It is nothing you have done or said; it is something that you are—you are too religious.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Rachel	‘Yes, mum,’ said she, quietly, as she went on arranging my hair. ‘Do you believe them, [MASK]?’ I asked, after a short pause. ‘No, Miss, not all.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Helen	‘I’m not going to,’ said I, somewhat testily, though without a grain of anger in my heart against any one but the meddling old woman. ‘But, [MASK], I’ve something to say to you before I go.’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Gilbert	‘Why, [MASK], you don’t look cold!’ said she, smilingly regarding my face, which no doubt seemed warm enough. ‘No,’ replied I, ‘but I want to see you comfortable before I go.’ ‘Me comfortable!’
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Hattersley	[MASK], you know, has not yet fulfilled his direful threat of throwing his precious person away on the first old maid that chose to evince a tenderness for him; but he still preserves a resolute determination to see himself a married man before the year is out.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Rose	[MASK] had neither the discrimination nor the virulence to regard the little demon as I did, and they still preserved their former intimacy. At the moment of her arrival, however, there was no one in the room but
<name>darling</name>	darling	Milicent?—Tell	murmured she, reluctantly approaching him. ‘I want to know what’s the matter with you,’ said he, pulling her on to his knee like a child. ‘What are you crying for, [MASK] me!’ ‘I’m not crying.’
<name>friend</name>	friend	Arthur	But death will come—it is coming now—fast, fast!—and—oh, if I could believe there was nothing after!” ‘“Don’t try to believe it, [MASK]; there is joy and glory after, if you will but try to reach it!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eliza	[MASK] seemed to have made the same resolution on her part. We had not met since the evening of the tea-party; but there was no visible emotion either of pleasure or pain, no attempt at pathos, no display of injured pride: she was cool in temper, civil in demeanour.
<name>Huntingdon</name>	Huntingdon	Helen	I was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning, and not a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room with a careless smile. ‘Are you cross still, [MASK]?’ said he, approaching as if to salute me.
<name>Cecily</name>	Cecily	Gilbert	‘Perhaps—occasionally; provided you never abuse the privilege.’ ‘I make no empty promises, but you shall see.’ ‘The moment you do our intimacy is at an end, that’s all.’ ‘And will you always call me [MASK]?
<name>Bates</name>	Bates	Benson	CHAPTER XLIV October 24th.—Thank heaven, I am free and safe at last. Early we rose, swiftly and quietly dressed, slowly and stealthily descended to the hall, where [MASK] stood ready with a light, to open the door and fasten it after us.
<name>where</name>	where	Helen	‘No.’ ‘Do you deny that he is sensible, sober, respectable?’ ‘No; he may be all this, but—’ ‘But, [MASK]! How many such men do you expect to meet with in the world?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arthur	‘No, how should you, when you never do anything to try them?’ ‘Then why do you try yours, [MASK]?’ ‘Do you think I have nothing to do but to stay at home and take care of myself like a woman?’
<name>it</name>	it	Helen	I did my best to soothe and comfort him. ‘“Death is so terrible,” he cried, “I cannot bear it! You don’t know, [MASK]—you can’t imagine what it is, because you haven’t it before you!
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	mamma	I threaten [MASK] sometimes that I’ll run away, and disgrace the family by earning my own livelihood, if she torments me any more; and then that frightens her a little. But I will do it, in good earnest, if they don’t mind.’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Rachel	[MASK] retired with a sigh, and I stepped into the parlour and shut the door. There, before the fire-place, stood the tall, graceful figure, wasted with many sorrows. I cast the manuscript on the table, and looked in her face.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Helen	‘You know I detest them both.’ ‘And me?’ ‘I have no reason to detest you.’ ‘But what are your sentiments towards me? [MASK]—Speak! How do you regard me?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arthur	Here was [MASK] left to me at last; and rousing from my despondent apathy, I exerted all my powers to eradicate the weeds that had been fostered in his infant mind, and sow again the good seed they had rendered unproductive.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Esther	He conducted himself, at first, with his usual cold, distant, half-stately, half-melancholy, altogether injured air; but [MASK] made no remark upon it this time: she had evidently been schooled into better manners.
<name>you</name>	you	Eliza	said I, appealing to her sister, who seemed to be absorbed in the hemming of a large, coarse sheet. ‘I don’t know,’ replied she. ‘Some idle slander somebody has been inventing, I suppose. I never heard it till [MASK] told me the other
<name>Fred</name>	Fred	Esther	‘Here, [MASK], I’ve brought you the rose,’ said he, extending it towards her. ‘Give it her yourself, you blockhead!’ cried she, recoiling with a spring from between us.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Helen	It is well that she is leaving to-morrow, for I could not well endure her presence for another day. This morning she rose earlier than usual. I found her in the room alone, when I went down to breakfast. ‘Oh, [MASK]!
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Rachel	‘Well,’ said she, ‘I’m sure I hope he’ll make her a good husband. They tell queer things about him downstairs. They were saying—’ ‘I know, [MASK]. I’ve heard all about him; but he’s reformed now.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Helen	‘I heard quite enough, [MASK]. And it was well for me that I did hear it; for nothing less could have cured my infatuation. I always said and thought, that I would never believe a word against you, unless I heard it from your own lips.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Gilbert	‘I have; but it would be wrong to talk of it now.’ ‘It was wrong to talk of it then, [MASK]; it would not now—unless to do so would be to violate the truth.’
<name>susceptibility</name>	susceptibility	Halford	and I somehow could not manage to get on very well together. The fact is, I believe, we were both of us a little too touchy. It is a troublesome thing, [MASK], this susceptibility to affronts where none are intended.
<name>The Man</name>	The Man	Grimsby	‘“You’d better try once more,” said [MASK], leaning across the table. And then he winked at me. ‘“I’ve nothing to try with,” said the poor devil, with a ghastly smile.
<name>him</name>	him	Arthur	At dinner I narrowly observed both her and [MASK], and saw nothing extraordinary in the conduct of either, nothing calculated to excite suspicion, except in distrustful minds, which mine was not, and therefore I would not suspect.
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Arthur	‘No, no, [MASK]; it’s too far,’ objected his mother. But I promised to bring him safe back after a turn or two up and down the meadow; and when she looked at his eager face she smiled and let him go.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Helen	She is a daughter of earth; you are an angel of heaven; only be not too austere in your divinity, and remember that I am a poor, fallible mortal. Come now, [MASK]; won’t you forgive me?’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Eliza	However, I resolved to make my visit a short one, and to talk to [MASK] in a brotherly, friendly sort of way, such as our long acquaintance might warrant me in assuming, and which, I thought, could neither give offence nor serve to encourage false hopes.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Lawrence	‘You will go to her, [MASK]?’ said I, as I put the letter into his hand. ‘Yes, immediately.’ ‘That’s right! I’ll leave you, then, to prepare for your departure.’
<name>God</name>	God	Providence	‘Wrong!’ repeated the vicar, with more than common solemnity—‘criminal, I should say—criminal! Not only is it making a fool of the boy, but it is despising the gifts of [MASK], and teaching him to trample them under his feet.’
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Helen	You told me that you could, and would too; and you promised—’ ‘Come, come, [MASK], don’t begin with that nonsense now; I can’t bear it.’ ‘Can’t bear what?—to be reminded of the promises you have broken?’
<name>dear</name>	dear	Eliza	‘What have I done to offend you?’ said she, more plaintively. ‘I wish I knew.’ ‘Come, take your tea, [MASK], and don’t be foolish,’ responded I, handing her the sugar and cream.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Milicent	‘When [MASK] uttered the same discouraging sentiments concerning marriage, I asked if she was happy: she said she was; but I only half believed her; and now I must put the same question to you.’
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Richard	Go on, [MASK].’ There was a touch of sadness as well as coldness in her voice, but I knew not to what to ascribe it. The carriage drove on and entered the gates before us. My little companion led me up the park, discoursing merrily all the way.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Helen	‘Oh, [MASK]! where did you learn all this?’ ‘In the Bible, aunt. I have searched it through, and found nearly thirty passages, all tending to support the same theory.’ ‘And is that the use you make of your Bible?
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Arthur	you know that I love you’ (and he pressed my hand to his feverish lips), ‘and what more could you desire?’ ‘Only, [MASK], that you would love yourself as truly and as faithfully as you are loved by me.’
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Helen	‘Why are you in such a hurry to leave me, [MASK]?’ he said, with a smile of the most provoking self-sufficiency. ‘You don’t hate me, you know.’ ‘Yes, I do—at this moment.’
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Annabella	If I had bitterly wept and deplored his lost affection, he would, perhaps, have condescended to pity me, and taken me into favour for a while, just to comfort his solitude and console him for the absence of his beloved [MASK], until he could meet her again, or some more fitting substitute.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Esther	But [MASK] is a child as yet, a little merry romp of fourteen: as honest-hearted, and as guileless and simple as her sister, but with a fearless spirit of her own, that I fancy her mother will find some difficulty in bending to her purposes.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Rachel	‘It is too true, [MASK],’ said I, answering her sad looks rather than her words. ‘I knew it, or I wouldn’t have mentioned such a thing.’ ‘But don’t you trouble yourself about it,’ said I, kissing her pale, time-wasted cheek.
<name>Barney</name>	Barney	Hattersley	‘I guess the best return I can make will be to take myself off,’ muttered [MASK], with a broad grin. His companion smiled, and he left the room. This put me on my guard.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Arthur	[MASK] did not talk much, but he laughed, and listened to the rest, and was in perfect good-humour, though not excited by wine. So that, altogether, we made a very merry, innocent, and entertaining party.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Arthur	It is now four days since the termination of our quarrel, and I am sure it has done us both good: it has made me like [MASK] a great deal better, and made him behave a great deal better to me.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ruby	And leaving him to enjoy his merriment alone, I touched [MASK] with the whip, and cantered on to rejoin our companions; for we had been walking our horses all this time, and were consequently a long way behind.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lawrence	When she was gone the rest was all a blank or worse. [MASK] attempted to draw me into conversation, but I snubbed him and went to another part of the room. Shortly after the party broke up and he himself took leave.
<name>Lady Catherine</name>	Lady Catherine	Annabella	‘Not at all, my dear! I should not mind if his lordship were to see fit to intoxicate himself every day: I should only the sooner be rid of him.’ ‘Oh, [MASK]!’
<name>Mr. Mason</name>	Mr. Mason	Milicent	I looked at his face to see if that was the case now. His eye met mine keenly, but steadily: there was something about him I did not understand, but he seemed sober enough. Not choosing to engage with him, I referred him to [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Helen	And do you think you can injure and degrade yourself, and I not feel it?’ ‘Degrade myself, [MASK]?’ ‘Yes, degrade! What have you been doing all this time?’ ‘You’d better not ask,’ said he, with a faint smile.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Helen	He was just at the foot of the stairs when I opened the door, and hearing my step in the hall—though I could hardly hear it myself—he instantly turned back. ‘[MASK], is that you?’ said he.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Frederick	fear you must think me very insensible, [MASK]: I know it is the custom for ladies to cry on these occasions, but I couldn’t squeeze a tear for my life.’ He only answered with a kiss, and pressed her still closer to his bosom.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Devil	‘My wife!’ said he, with a start. ‘For heaven’s sake, don’t mention her—I have none. [MASK] take her,’ he cried, a moment after, ‘and you, too! What did you do it for?’
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Thomas	My aunt sent [MASK] in quest of me, to ask if I were not coming to tea; but I bade him say I should not take any to-night, and, happily, she was too much occupied with her guests to make any further inquiries at the time.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Markham	It may be natural enough that, in her ignorance of the relationship, she should feel some degree of enmity against her, but no good or amiable woman would be capable of evincing that bitter, cold-blooded, designing malice towards a fancied rival that I have observed in her.’ ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Helen	I therefore hesitated to reply. Perhaps my former answer had implied too much: he had heard my voice falter, and might have seen me brush away a tear. ‘Are you going to forgive me, [MASK]?’ he resumed, more humbly.
<name>most people</name>	most people	Milicent	No, no: even if I told him all my grievances, which I should be very reluctant to do, he would be certain to disapprove of the step: it would seem like madness to him, as it would to my uncle and aunt, or to [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Arthur	‘Then you will leave me again, [MASK]?’ said I. ‘Yes, dearest, but only to love you the better when I come back, and make up for all past offences and short-comings; and you needn’t fear me this time: there are no temptations on the mountains.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Gilbert	Look, [MASK], it is still fresh and blooming as a flower can be, with the cold snow even now on its petals.—Will you have it?’ I held out my hand: I dared not speak lest my emotion should overmaster me.
<name>London</name>	London	Grassdale	‘Here, take it,’ said I, ‘if you don’t want me to read it.’ ‘No,’ replied he, ‘you may read it if you like.’ I read it, and so may you. [MASK], Nov. 4th.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Gilbert	I am busy just now.’ ‘Oh! but, [MASK], how can you be so composed about it? You won’t mind business for an hour or two in a case of this sort, when your friend is at the point of death.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Humph	And then his wife advised him to it, they say: she’d brought most of the property, and it was her wish that this lady should have it.’ ‘[MASK]! She’ll be a fine catch for somebody.’ ‘She will so.
