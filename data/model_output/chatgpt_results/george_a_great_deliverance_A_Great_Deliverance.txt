<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Russell	“Would have been easier to divorce him, I’d think.” “No. Not for a Catholic.” “Even so, [MASK]’s a better candidate if you ask me. Who knows where he went?”
<name>John</name>	John	Lynley	“Just stay out of my way.” With that, he turned on his heel and pushed his way through the crowd towards the exit. “Nicely done. Sergeant.” [MASK]’s voice was serene. His eyes searched through the swarm of humanity in the terminal.
<name>she</name>	she	Nell	Yet what was there to fear when [MASK]— whoever she was—could be nothing more nor less than the lovely creature who stood by his side, who listened, rapt, to his words, who held him in her arms at night?
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Lynley	[MASK] set down what was obviously the final portrait of the woman. She looked about twenty-four: a fresh, smiling face; golden freckles sprinkled across the bridge of her nose; long, gleaming blonde hair tied back and curled. Beguiling.
<name>Ellery</name>	Ellery	Lynley	I got one myself. And if I can get her certified mentally incompetent, I intend to do so. Do you think that’s worse than seeing she ends up in prison?” “So you think she did kill her father?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Lynley	It was sudden, unexpected. She was trying to adjust. [MASK]’s was turning out to be such a multifaceted character, like a diamond cut by a master jeweller, that in every situation a new surface glittered that she had never seen before.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Deborah	“Now you’d best beware of the baby’s cry,” she pronounced solemnly. It was as if she’d spoken exactly on cue. The hounds would surely howl next. “The baby’s cry? Have the Americans a child with them?” [MASK] asked.
<name>The garnet necklace</name>	The garnet necklace	Garnets	His men are meticulous, accurate to the last detail. They conducted an investigation and arrested the old crone’s son-in-law. It was an apparent dispute over the ownership of a garnet necklace.” “[MASK]? Were they stolen?”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Roberta	“When he fell asleep that night in my bed, I went to his room and I found the key. What happened to it? I left it for you.” [MASK] struggled with information buried so long beneath the weight of her childhood terrors.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Barbara	But it’s my only bone of contention with that particular recording of 1812” He flipped the stereo off. [MASK] noticed for the first time that he wore absolutely no jewellery—no crested signet ring, no expensive wrist watch to flash gold richly when it caught the light.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Thomas	His hand slid the length of her body. She sighed. “[MASK].” He lifted his head. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes bright. “I must go.” “Not just yet.” “Look at the time.”
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Roberta	“She does, doesn’t she?” The woman looked as if she appreciated his concurring with her. “[MASK] was big like her father, very solid and silent. People will tell you she had no personality at all, but that’s not true.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Gillian	She thought about everything that had been said about [MASK]: about her delinquent behaviour, her sexual licence, and her ability to hide both under an exterior of angelic refinement. There was only one way to deal with someone that clever. Be tough, be aggressive, be absolutely ruthless.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Havers	I’ll handle this.” “Please, sir.” He could hear the despair in her voice. He couldn’t help it, couldn’t stop it, couldn’t worry about it now. “Just do as I say, [MASK]. Go home.
<name>she</name>	she	Lynley	The pavement on either side of the street was raised only slightly off the road, and water pooled in front of doorways from the morning’s rainfall. But the sky was clear now, and the air was so fresh that [MASK] could taste its purity.
<name>David</name>	David	Parrish	Other than an organ, a tape recorder, a receiver, and a turntable, there was nothing in the room save a threadbare carpet and a few old chairs. [MASK] switched off the tape recorder that had been the source of the sound.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Havers	Please.” He hesitated. She watched him. “Please,” she repeated. He glanced at the closed front door of the house, knowing that he couldn’t possibly face the responsibility of putting the matter into [MASK]’s incapable hands. Not here.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Sid	A woman was descending, calling over her shoulder to someone who remained on the floor above. “Just the two of us are going. You must come as well and we’ll make a party of it, [MASK].”
<name>her</name>	her	Gilly	“I felt so inadequate. Inspector, such a failure as a friend and as a teacher that she couldn’t talk to me about what had happened to [MASK]. But she just couldn’t talk, so she blamed it all on being allergic to her dog.”
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Webberly	“Oh, but I haven’t enough—” [MASK] held up a restraining hand. “It’s on the Yard, Father.” On the Yard. The priest mouthed the words, coloured with pleasure at the implication of brotherhood and acceptance behind them.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	William	“Tell us what happened when you arrived.” “I went to the house first, but no one was there. The door wasn’t locked and I remember thinking that was strange. [MASK] always locked everything tight as a drum if he went out.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Hank	She put her bejewelled hand on her husband’s arm, attempting to draw him out onto the abbey grounds. “Hellsapoppin, no,” [MASK] answered pleasantly. “I have done e-n-u-f-f walking on this trip to last me a lifetime.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Danny	“I don’ want that.” “Then what do you want? I need to know because I know very well what I want, [MASK], and if we both don’t want the same thing, then there’s really no use, is there?”
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Samuels	Near the end of the corridor, a narrow door was recessed into the wall, and [MASK] stopped before it, opening it and switching on the light to reveal a small, cramped room. He motioned them inside.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Barbara	“All by himself?” [MASK] asked casually. Her mother looked away, fingering the edges of her album, picking nervously at the artificial gold leaf. She gave a sudden movement, a quick, brilliant smile, and pulled out a chair.
<name>he</name>	he	Madeline	and I would be only too happy to see her put away for life. You think I don’t know that’s what everyone believes? You think [MASK] doesn’t know it?” He laughed bitterly. “No, I didn’t get her a solicitor.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ezra	It wasn’t time for bed.” “Changing for dinner, I dare say. He’s up in his room, looks out the window, sees [MASK] trespassing, and comes charging into the yard.” “I suppose that could be it.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Havers	He wondered, not for the first time, if this partnership of two such antipodal personalities had even the ghost of a chance for success. [MASK] was like a hedgehog, curling herself into a protective ball of thistle at the least provocation.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Andrew	I’ve told you repeatedly that a barrister can’t possibly make you happy. Did the reception end well? . . . He did? Oh Lord, what a scene that must have been. Has [MASK] ever cried in his life? . . .
<name>Sonny</name>	Sonny	Tom	Not a twitch of the e-y-e. I’m telling you, [MASK], if it’s action you’re looking for, you oughta get yourself down here.” He sighed with satisfaction and fingered his heavy gold chain. “L-u-v. Wonderful thing, huh?
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Whiskers	“Exactly. I was trotting along the road with [MASK] in tow. He’d put in his usual appearance on the common and, as it seemed late to let the old boy find his own way home, I was taking him there myself.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Deb	For everything. Really. For it all.” “The best, [MASK],” he said lightly in reply. He went to her, hugged her quickly to him, and brushed a kiss against her hair.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Teys	“Perhaps someone brought it with him.” “Perhaps. I suppose the person could have administered it to the dog, waited for it to take effect, slit the dog’s throat, and waited for [MASK] to come out to the bam.”
<name>Tommy's</name>	Tommy's	Teys	“That idea doesn’t wash.” “Why not?” He pointed to the garment on the back of the car. “Look at the pattern. [MASK]’s blood is in splatters. You know what that means as well as I.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Gilly	“Back?” “Oh yes, back. He’d left me shortly after [MASK] was bom and had begun to sleep elsewhere. On the couch, in the sewing room, anywhere but with me.” “Why?”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Houseman	“No, no, that won’t be necessary. Just wait a moment, old chap.” [MASK] leaned back in his chair, eyeing the grey sky for a minute. He reached over to his dented filing cabinet, opening and closing a few drawers for effect.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Lynley	It would be too easy.” “Please. I beg you. For me.” “Not without you. I won’t do that. Whatever you feel you must do here, I’ll be here as well.” He looked at [MASK].
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Deborah	“Sleep with a crucifix clutched in one’s hand?” [MASK] punched him lightly on the knee. “I want to know. I insist upon knowing. Shall I have my life blighted because I’ve married a cynic?
<name>Grandmama</name>	Grandmama	Keldale	“As does this,” she said solemnly. “[MASK] was Royalist, you know, during the war.” She spoke as though the late seventeenth century were only a week removed. “Loyal t’ the last man of ’em t’ the King.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	William	“I thought that if we had a second child, we would each have someone special to love. So I ... I seduced [MASK] back to our bed.” “Back?” “Oh yes, back.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Helen	If you’re off, then, let me fetch the bride and groom to bid you farewell.” His face altered swiftly. “No. [MASK], I . . . just make my excuses.” A look passed between them, something said without being said.
<name>Mr. Weston</name>	Mr. Weston	Hank	She bobbed a nervous good morning, avoiding their eyes, and awkwardly distributed breakfast, gnawing her bottom lip miserably as she did so. “Shy little thing,” [MASK] observed loudly, squashing a square of toast into the centre of his fried egg.
<name>she</name>	she	Barbara	The moment, [MASK] decided, was probably as good as any to give him the news. “I’m off the street,’’ she announced bluntly. “That’s why I’ve come, if you’re wondering.” He turned slowly towards her.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Tears	[MASK] threatened once again. “She is. Absolutely. But it would be a fairly strange world if every woman were exactly like her, wouldn’t it? Believe me, there are many women who are very pretty and look nothing like her.”
<name>his daughter</name>	his daughter	Gilly	“As far as he was concerned, neither of those girls could do anything wrong. How was I supposed to tell him that [MASK], the proverbial apple of his eye, was rubbing up to me like a cat in heat and taking me on like a whore?
<name>John</name>	John	Nigel	“You don’t have to have children. Or you could adopt.” “Men say that, of course. [MASK] does all the time. But there’s no point to marriage as far as I’m concerned if I can’t have my own child.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Webberly	“I imagine her charms made that easy to believe.’’ [MASK]’s mouth quirked. He stubbed out the tip of his cigar in the ashtray and clasped his freckled hands over his stomach. They effectively hid the stain on his waistcoat.
<name>John</name>	John	Caroline	“And we’ll be as happy as hedgehogs, the four of us.” “You think it’s amusing, don’t you? But just look at me. One morning without [MASK] in the flat and I’m a complete disaster.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Lynley	[MASK] awoke with a jolt. Early morning light filtered into the room in delicate bands that streaked across the floor to the bed. A chill breeze blew back the curtains and carried upon it the pleasant sounds of waking birds and the distant cries of sheep.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	William	“He wouldn’t!” she cried passionately. “This is a man who has never lifted his hand to strike one of his own children! He was angry—yes, I’ve said that—but his anger was with me, not with [MASK]!
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Barbara	Watching him, [MASK] was struck by how a trick of light falling across hair, cheek, and brow made him look vastly younger than his thirty-two years. And yet nothing altered or obscured the man’s intelligence or the wit behind his eyes, not even the shadows.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Barb	It was foul and unhealthy, and she welcomed it. She breathed it in deeply, finding it fitting, finding it just. She closed the door behind her and leaned against it, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness. Here it is, [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Tessa	[MASK], he saw, was gathering strength now to get through this ordeal, as if one hand could give the other a transfusion of courage through the simple expedient of fingers intertwined. It seemed to work. She looked up, her expression defiant.
<name>Eden</name>	Eden	Bridie	He pulled her to him roughly, felt her heat and passion, heard her cry of pleasure, felt the shadows drift away. “What about [MASK]?” “What do you mean?” “She’s like a little lost soul.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Lynley	You’re a man without mercy.” “Had I known you were coming, I’d hardly have been so remiss as to serve it twice in one week,” [MASK] replied pointedly. Unoffended, she laughed.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Deborah	It was a damp and musty place, poorly lit and smelling of loam. Green mould clung to the walls. [MASK] shivered. “Poor man. It’s so cold here. One would think he might prefer to be buried somewhere in the sun.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Lovey	The wonderful, delicious irony of it all: go in with a broken leg, come out with leukaemia. It had taken him four agonising years to die. Four years for them to make this descent into madness. “[MASK]?” The voice was tremulous.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Havers	“How can you be certain of that?” “Because I think I saw him. [MASK]. At the Yard.” “So he did go to turn her in. I suppose she knew all along that he would.” “No.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Havers	The fragile thread of communication they had established between them seemed to be utterly broken. To make matters worse, she’d returned to her hideous light blue suit and ridiculous, coloured tights. “[MASK],” he said sharply. “Are you listening to me?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lynley	“He’s done them. But he has no intention of giving them to us. Not if that would make our job easier.” [MASK] uttered an oath beneath his breath and swept the garments back into their cardboard container. “What’s to do?”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Han	“Style, is it?” the publican called back cheerfully. “She’s a cheap one to dress, all right. But she’s running through my fortune buying gunk for her hair.” “How d’you keep them spikes up, [MASK]?”
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Barbara	Her stubby features looked like paste. “[MASK]—” “I’m sorry! Dammit! I’m doing it all over again! Why do I bother? I’m no good at this. I always do it.
<name>overwhelming</name>	overwhelming	Deborah	He couldn’t have answered if his life depended upon it. He found that he didn’t know what to do with himself, where to cast his eyes, what to say. He was only conscious of [MASK].
<name>Donald</name>	Donald	Dougal	She hopped off the steps and filled a shallow pan with water. “Here, [MASK],” she called. The duck ignored her. There was a chance the food might be taken away if he did not eat it all as fast as he could.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Barbara	It would have to be the white shirtwaist again. [MASK] took it out of the wardrobe and looked at it critically. A different belt and it wouldn’t look bad. Or perhaps a scarf at the throat. Had she brought a scarf?
<name>Mr. B</name>	Mr. B	Gillian	She regarded him curiously. “I don’t know. He’s vanished. I went directly in to see [MASK], and later, when I came out of the bedroom, he’d gone. I spent the night there, of course, and he never returned.”
<name>Nabokov</name>	Nabokov	Teys	[MASK] was aroused by children. His marriage to a sixteen-year-old girl—not a voluptuous, womanly sixteen-year-old, but a late-maturing sixteen-year-old—would have been a glaring sign to anyone looking for aberrant behaviour.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Tommy	“Being cut out like this. It’s so hard. I hate it.” He understood. “That’s because you love him.” She stared at him for a moment before she replied. “I do. I do love him, [MASK].
<name>darling</name>	darling	Tommy	But it was more than that, really. It was arguing, laughing, hearing the sweet voice say Oh, you think you’re right, [MASK], but I shall prove you wrong! He felt loneliness settle on him like a cold, wet shroud.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Deb	I still want you, [MASK].” She turned to him then, her face quite white, her eyes gleaming with tears. “You can’t. You’ve got to let that go.” “My mind accepts that, but nothing else does.”
<name>undetermined</name>	undetermined	Barbara	There were long silences in which the woman looked at the bank of the river next to the common and the man focused his attention on the lodge—or perhaps the car in front of it. Someone was significantly interested in the arrival of the police, [MASK] decided.
<name>the duck</name>	the duck	Dougal	“Got to feed [MASK],” she said. “Got to go to school today as well. I hate school.” He joined her in the yard. The duck watched his approach warily, one brown eye on him and the other on the promised breakfast.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Russell	Can you understand what it’s like to be married to a man eighteen years older than yourself when you’re only sixteen? Of course you can’t. No one can. Not even [MASK].” “You didn’t want to stay on in school?”
<name>Huntington</name>	Huntington	Huntington	“[MASK]’s chorea. At the end he didn’t even recognise his wife. It was horrible. For everyone. Changed everyone’s life to see him die that way.” He blinked several times and gave his attention to his cigarette and then to his fingernails.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Bridie	Companionably, they watched as the duck gorged himself. [MASK] sighed. She was inspecting the scuffed tops of her shoes and she rubbed at them ineffectually with a dirty finger. “Don’t know why I have to go to school anyway.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Jacob	During that time he had been ordained, had made his decision to be part of his father’s work, had laboured like [MASK] in pursuit of a Rachel he could never be certain of winning. Yet that thought had not discouraged him.
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Lynley	Her curly hair trapped the sunlight, burning an autumn contrast against the bright green pullover—several sizes too large—that she wore. “Inside. He has a stomachache today.” [MASK] wondered idly how one diagnosed a stomachache in a mallard and wisely thought better of asking.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	Havers	“No need for you to come, [MASK]. Go have a bit of a rest.” “I can certainly—” “That’s an order, Sergeant.” Damn him. “Yes, sir.”
<name>the fiddler</name>	the fiddler	Lynley	That’s not a walk you would make in the dark, is it?” “Course not.” “And you heard music from the farmhouse?” “Ha!” He waved his glass at [MASK]. “Whole screamin’ band, In . .
<name>Father Brown</name>	Father Brown	Sunshine	[MASK].” The shaking hand moved quickly to the lights and switched them on, and the priest gestured towards the church. “Well. What do you think of it?” It was decidedly not the expected interior of a village church.
<name>Dr. Roylott</name>	Dr. Roylott	Stepha	An expression of distaste passed across [MASK]’s face. “It’s impossible. I’m sorry, but it’s just impossible. Beyond that, no weapon was ever found. Surely she didn’t slit the poor animal’s throat with an l» axe!
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Barbara	[MASK] introduced herself, surprised at the firmness of the woman’s grip. Her hands were thin, very cool to the touch. “He’s wanted at the Yard.” “Poor man. How miserable. How damnably unfair.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bridie	It’s bad enough seeing [MASK] every day and thinking every time she stumbles or drops something that she’s got the bloody disease herself. I don’t know what I’d do if I had a child of my own. Probably drive myself mad with worry.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	Ha! Who could ever remind him of [MASK], with her impeccable wardrobe, her well-cut hair, her manicured hands, her lyrical voice? She yanked a white wool shirtwaist from the wardrobe and tossed it onto the rumpled bed. It really was almost amusing.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Curious	[MASK], how it had all happened in a moment. She loved him, had loved him from her childhood. But in a dizzying lightning-bolt moment of time, she’d realised that it had changed somehow, becoming quite different between them from what it had been before.
<name>He</name>	He	Lynley	He recognised the familiar sweep of the bay, the grey and white buildings on the shore, and the assortment of boats left beached at low tide. “Yes,” she responded. She volunteered nothing else. Quiescent, she awaited the inevitable. The silence continued. [MASK] allowed it to do so.
<name>John</name>	John	Lynley	“I’m sorry for putting you through it,” [MASK] said. “But you were the only one I could trust to manage it. I don’t know what I would have done had you not been at home when I phoned.”
<name>She</name>	She	Barbara	Then she stopped.” [MASK] pushed her hair back behind her ears. It was quite unimportant, she told herself, if he didn’t believe her, if he laughed at the conclusions she had drawn after nearly three hours in that horrible room.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Lynley	“Unconscious!” [MASK] scanned the report and tossed it down on the table. “Then he couldn’t have been killed to silence him.” “Hardly. He wouldn’t have been making a sound.” “Was there enough barbiturate to kill him?
<name>Madame Arcati</name>	Madame Arcati	Danny	She curled up on the floor next to his chair, warming herself, allowing the fire to tingle against her skin. “A ghost baby, I take it?” she said to [MASK]. “An absolute one that I heard myself. You’ll hear it as well.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Wren	Champagne cocktails in the garden of the Old House. You would have been proud of me. I even remembered that [MASK] built it, so all these years of your seeing to my education haven’t been in vain.”
<name>John</name>	John	Lynley	But nothing else did, [MASK] thought. In his mind he saw the lonely little girl in the gloomy farmhouse, surrounded by the ghosts and voices of the past, living her life in grim sterility, taking her nourishment from books.
<name>her</name>	her	Gilly	“Did they go back to reading the Bible after that?” She shook her head. “He never asked [MASK] to read the Bible after that.” “Did he read it with you?” “No. Just alone.”
<name>Jemima</name>	Jemima	Dougal	Alone, he walked back towards the lodge, feeling the cloak of desolation settle more firmly round his shoulders. He had just reached the Odell house when the garden door opened and a little figure hurtled determinedly down the steps. She was followed moments later by her duck. “You wait here, [MASK]!”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Barbara	“Can you tell me how to locate her? It’s quite important that I find her as soon as possible.” “She’s not in trouble, is she?” “It’s important that I find her,” [MASK] said again.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Barbara	She refused to submit. How long will it take? Will it never end? “You’ve not answered me, [MASK].” Her mother’s voice quivered with anxiety. “I did work so hard on the trip all today.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Lord	She gave a brittle smile. “And it certainly was the old heat of passion last night, wasn’t it? I couldn’t believe it when you two started banging away on a second go. And so soonl [MASK], you barely gave it a rest.”
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Deborah	He let out his breath sharply in self-derision and tossed the file onto the bedside table. He dropped his spectacles on top of it, rubbed his eyes, and adjusted the pillows behind his back. [MASK] had spoken to her husband.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Lynley	[MASK] moved to a book stand that was fixed underneath the room’s only window. It was the kind used for large dictionaries, but on its top rested an immense, illuminated Bible. He ran his fingers down the page to which the book was open.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Daze	He turned the cigarette case over in his hand so that the old ornate A engraved on its cover was face up. “But it’s an interesting question. If my father were still alive, I’d ask him. This was his. [MASK] is my mother.”
