<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Clayton	He was almost fifteen years old, and he was already as tall as [MASK] had been. “Did you have fun?” He asked as they waited for her trunks, so the customs officer could inspect them. “I did. But I missed you too much.”
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Sasha	“Doing what?” “Having dinner with a friend.” “[MASK], you’re only eighteen, you can’t run around anywhere you like. What about school?” “I graduate in two months, what difference does it make now?”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Grandmama	“Don’t you think, my love?” “Hm? . . . Sorry, [MASK]?” She had been frowning and staring out the window as they drove down the Champs-Elys6es to the rue Marbeuf. She had been thinking of something far more important.
<name>He</name>	He	One	She giggled, feeling as though she were the keeper of the world’s most important secret. [MASK] couldn’t see it yet, but she knew, and ever since the doctor had told her the news, she felt as though she knew life’s true meaning.
<name>She</name>	She	Zoya	She was nervous about meeting them, but he reassured her as best he could after surprising her one Friday night by telling her he had told his mother he was bringing her to dinner. “What did she say?” [MASK] looked at him worriedly, wearing a new black dress.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Zoya	The vision of her home in flames never seemed to dim . . . nor the sight of her brother bleeding to death on the marble floor of the Fontanka Palace only four days before. It was morning before [MASK] fell asleep, as a fresh blizzard raged outside
<name>Alida</name>	Alida	Zoya	She seems to be very fond of you. Perhaps that will be enough.” But neither of them thought it was. The old woman knew even better than he that once he brought her close to him, [MASK]’s life would never be quite the same again.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Axelle	It was the only The idea of a countess serving them would excite them beyond words, [MASK] knew. “I could give you a try, madame . . . Countess, I suppose I should say. You must use your title here.” “Of course.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Zoya	It was so difficult having her here. Things were so different, and the hardest part was that much as the old woman hated to admit it to herself, [MASK] was no longer a child, and it wasn’t easy to control her.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Allison	“I won’t ask you for more than that. I don’t have a right to. I won’t lie to you. Ever. You know that I can’t leave [MASK], and if what I can give you isn’t enough, I’ll understand it.”
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Zoya	“But I’m afraid that my knees won’t agree. I seem to have a touch of rheumatism this winter.” The “touch” she referred to would have crippled a lesser woman. Only [MASK] suspected how much pain she was in.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Zoya	“You must go now.” He led her solemnly outside as his wife took her grandmother’s arm and they helped them into their sled as [MASK] cried. The last of the servants had come to say good-bye to them and they were crying too.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Zoya	“We meet again, I see. I’d better be careful or you’ll be selling the same coats I am!” But he didn’t look worried. He cast an eye over [MASK] again, this time in a bright pink linen suit that made her look almost girlish.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Paul	I’m in love with you,” his eyes fought for what he so desperately wanted, as she watched him. “Why? Why do you love me, [MASK]?” “Because you’re exactly what and who I’ve always wanted.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Simon	I’m too old to start again.” And she knew that no one would ever measure up to [MASK]. “Bullshit, I’m almost fifty-five, and if I had the chance to start again, I’d leap at it.”
<name>mercy</name>	mercy	Tsar	There was an endless pause as the soldier considered them and then suddenly stepped back, calling over his shoulder to his compatriots. “Let them through. But remember, old woman,” he turned to her with harsh words, “there is no more [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zoya	“She says she’s not hungry. Do you think I should get the doctor for her tonight?” [MASK] hesitated for a long moment, weighing the decision. A night call to the house would be even more expensive than a visit to his office.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Axelle	It was perfect. The children would both be in school in the fall, and she would be home by six o’clock every night. It was respectable . . . it was perfect . . . she couldn’t repress a smile of relief as [MASK] smiled at her.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Feodor	And it wasn’t anything serious after all, only measles. The peasants hurried from the road as the troika sped past, and [MASK] shouted at the three black horses that drew them. He had worked for her grandfather as a boy, and his father had worked for their family before him.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Clayton	Maybe we should just let her sleep. I put a blanket over her to keep her warm.” It was one of the blankets [MASK] had given them the previous summer. “Don’t forget to give me that doctor’s name tomorrow before you go to school.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Zoya	All [MASK] could think of for two days was the extraordinary opportunity she was about to have, and she was praying to all her guardian angels and favorite saints that she wouldn’t make a mess of it. What if she was awkward ... if she fell ... if he hated her style . . .
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Simon	She even dropped in on [MASK] at his office frequently, and listened avidly to his plans for his business. He had decided to add a line of children’s coats, and he was anxious for her advice, which she gave him.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	mademoiselle	“My grandmother sent someone to chaperone me, and I sent him home. I suspect he was quite glad of it, though, and so was I.” She blushed slightly then and he laughed. “In that case, [MASK], may I offer you my escort now?
<name>Vronsky</name>	Vronsky	Feodor	There were at least a dozen of the Preobrajensky Guard outside, there was running and shouting and they were carrying something as he heard a shout fly from his own mouth and he abandoned [MASK] and his troika almost before it stopped, shouting to himself, “Oh my God ...
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Zoya	[MASK] realized as she listened that this was an aspect of his life she hadn’t truly understood. It was one thing to hear him tell about it, and another to actually meet them. She felt suddenly terrified that she would never measure up in their eyes.
<name>He</name>	He	Zoya	She was as strong as steel and twice as determined. And [MASK] was no match for her, not yet in any case, and they both knew it. “You can and you will, and you must not say anything to the children.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nicholas	They always knew that the important thing was to be together, and to love each other, and to be strong . . . and that’s what we have to do now,” the tears were running down her cheeks as she spoke, but [MASK] was looking at her solemnly, trying desperately to understand.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Zoya	You’re not going to take food out of anyone’s mouth,” he thought about it quietly for a minute as [MASK] tried to absorb what she’d heard in the past half hour, “in fact, I think it might be a damn good investment.”
<name>Gruffly</name>	Gruffly	Charlie	And that night she went back to the theater again, as she did for the next weeks until the dancers returned from their measles. But when they did, [MASK] gruffly told her they’d keep her on, she had good legs, and she didn’t give him any trouble.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Evgenia	Is that so much better than what I want to do?” “It’s pathetic.” [MASK] wheeled on her with broken eyes and a heart that was breaking. “He was an important man only three months ago, and long ago his father was a great one.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Zoya	She knelt on the sidewalk beside her child, moaning and calling her name, as the firemen worked desperately to save her, and then slowly, with a small cry, she stirred, and [MASK] lay down beside her and cried as she stroked her curls and held her.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Feodor	They carried her upstairs to her rooms, and [MASK] stood weeping openly as a wail seemed to fill the entire hallway. All of the servants had come to stand there . . . too late . . . everyone too late to help him.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Zoya	The American ish flu, and [MASK] and her grandmother took turns nursing him for weeks, but finally, unable to eat or drink, or even see anymore, he succumbed, as both women sat crying silently at his bedside.
<name>He</name>	He	Axelle	She was articulate, and she spoke French, not that it mattered so much here. And she seemed to exude an innate sense of style, even in the inexpensive dress. [MASK] was intrigued. “Have you worked in fashion before?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mashka	“You can and you will, and you must not say anything to the children. They have their own worries just now. We must not burden them, it wouldn’t be fair.” “WTiat will I say to [MASK]?”
<name>Nan</name>	Nan	Grandmama	She had loved the touch of her grandmother’s hands since she was a child, and she reached up and kissed her tenderly. “Thank you, [MASK]. I so want to keep him.” “And so you shall, little one ... so you shall. . . .”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Grandmama	“Don’t talk about him like that. He’s dead. He wouldn’t like any of the things that have happened to us, [MASK]. But they have, and we have to do something about it. We can’t just sit here and starve.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Zoya	He paid for their midnight supper then and she looked sad as he took her home. “I’d like to see you again sometime, [MASK].” It seemed such a trite thing to say to her, but he was suddenly uncomfortable about making their outings clandestine.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Simon	He was a sensible young man, with a kind heart, and a mind that had been honed by running [MASK]’s businesses. “Will you be very surprised if I tell you I’m going to get married in the fall?” His eyes played with hers and she laughed.
<name>Annabel</name>	Annabel	Sasha	She was surprised that he still remembered her, and [MASK] sulked for a day because it wasn’t a Russian wolfhound. They were still all the rage, though not quite as much as they had been in the late twenties.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Clayton	They dance until they drop, or teach, whichever comes first.” Most of the great dancers she knew had never married, and she wasn’t sure she cared. There was no one she knew that she could imagine marrying. [MASK] was only a friend.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Simon	She only felt sorry for [MASK], who looked miserable as he listened to the exchange between his mother and the woman he wanted to marry. But after the bond of their lovemaking and the closeness that had been born of it, they both knew that nothing could keep them apart now.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Simon	well, whatever it has to be.” And he instinctively knew that she didn’t want more than that from him. She had her children, the store, and her memories of [MASK]. “I won’t ask you for more than that.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clayton	She smiled at him, and bent to kiss his cheek as she saw tears come to his eyes. It wasn’t fair, having to do this to the children, and she fought back a wave of the anger she had recently begun to feel for [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	mademoiselle	“Aren’t you a naughty child! And if I ask you to join me for dinner tonight, [MASK]? What then?” She knit her brows as she thought of it, and then looked at him. “I’m not sure.
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Zoya	CHAPTER 1 [MASK] closed her eyes again as the troika flew across the icy ground, the soft mist of snow leaving tiny damp kisses on her cheeks, and turning her eyelashes to lace as she listened to the horses’ bells dancing in her ears like music.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Evgenia	There were only a dozen rooms, but the night clerk assured them two of them were vacant. They had to use a common bathroom down the hall, which was something of a shock to [MASK], but even that didn’t matter now.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Zoya	“We really ought to be thinking more about hats and shoes,” [MASK] said pensively, as she closed her eyes and thought for a moment. “We have to give them more than just dresses and evening gowns and suits . . . that’s always been our strength.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Zoya	“Will your husband be pleased?” “I ... he . . .” [MASK] could hardly speak, her eyes filled with tears, and promising to return in a month, she hurried out of the office.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Zoya	“No, you’re not. She’s better off with you than she would have been with them. She’s a lucky child.” And he was a lucky man to share his life with her. The blessings in [MASK]’s life touched everyone around her . . .
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Paul	This was her turf, not his, and it allowed [MASK] to share her present more than her past, which suddenly seemed more important. They walked to lunch at “21,” and at three o’clock they were still talking and laughing.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Natalya	[MASK] would have been constitutionally unable to do anything like it. The old Countess had been fiercely disappointed when her son had not married a Russian. The fact that a German had been good enough for the Tsar was only small consolation.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Clayton	She gave the driver the address on the rue Daru, and when she saw it, she caught her breath ... it was still the same . . . nothing had changed since that Christmas Eve long ago when she had gone there with her grandmother and [MASK].
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sasha	There were plenty of women who could afford that sort of thing. She took the bus uptown, after committing [MASK] to her brother’s care, and with a nervous heart, leaving them alone, she got off close to the address in the ad.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Darling	“[MASK], it doesn’t change how much I love you. Don’t you know that?” she said helplessly. “I don’t care! And I don’t want to live here with you, if you have a baby!”
<name>Germaine</name>	Germaine	Zoya	Till tomorrow night then.” He sprang from the car and helped her out. She thanked him politely for the ride, and he waved at her as he drove back toward the rue Constantine with a song in his heart as he thought of [MASK]. CHAPTER 15
<name>them</name>	them	Zoya	They ordered dozens of different sweaters for the shop, and had a long conversation with the designer herself, explaining the needs and preferences of their clientele. She was an interesting woman, and they were intrigued to find that she was only three years older than [MASK].
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Zoya	The next day he was later than he had been the day before, and by eleven o’clock, [MASK] was getting worried. They had no phone, so she couldn’t call, but at eleven-thirty he appeared, struggling with an enormous bundle wrapped in brown paper.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Clayton	“When is it due?” “Not for a long time, [MASK]. Not until August.” He offered to move to another room, so as not to disturb her sleep, and she only laughed at his concern. “Don’t you dare!
<name>He</name>	He	Zoya	She was gone again that night, and didn’t return until well after four o’clock in the morning. She was even more beautiful than she’d been before, she was too young for her excesses to hurt her looks, but [MASK] knew that if she didn’t stop, in time they would.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Evgenia	This time he had taken the time to go shopping. “Good morning, ladies!” He seemed in exceptionally good humor, [MASK] noticed with a worried glance, but she knew that there was nothing she could do to stop them.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sasha	And [MASK] is a little bit spoiled. She was the apple of her father’s eye.” “Does she look like you?” He was intrigued by everything, but she shook her head. “Not really, she looks more like him.”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Allison	“I never intended to fall in love with you, but I did. Is that so wrong?” She couldn’t tell him that it was, after all she knew of the emptiness of his life with [MASK]. “It’s not wrong.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Zoya	“I have never in my life ever asked a woman to marry me. I’m in love with you. I’m a responsible man. I have a business. My family thinks I’m very intelligent. I am begging you, [MASK] . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Evgenia	Besides, she had to take care of [MASK]. “You’d make a wonderful wife.” He said it so seriously that she laughed. “My brother would have said you were crazy. I’m a terrible cook, I hate to sew.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Zoya	“Oh, [MASK] . . .” He came around the kitchen table to hold her close to him. He wanted to get her out of the house before something happened that she’d regret. The pull of her was so great, it was almost painful.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Nijinsky	“I am.” She smiled, hoping he would forget her tears, as she listened to the distant strains of another waltz. She said the words with pride, thinking again how lucky she was. “Wasn’t [MASK] marvelous tonight?”
<name>himself</name>	himself	Simon	It was a nice carefree feeling not having to worry about the children. It was different when she had to think of them, it made her feel more serious and less romantic. But now all she had to think about was enjoying [MASK]. And he laughed at her suggestion.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Zoya	She had an elite clientele, and titles meant a great deal to most of them. Many of them were marrying princes and counts, just so they could have titles too. [MASK] followed her into a beautifully appointed black and white sitting room.
<name>[MASK]</name>	[MASK]	Zoya	She looked mischievously at her young friend, “Unfortunately, both were married.” But one of them had set her up with the shop. It was a rumor [MASK] had heard before but had never lent much credence to. Perhaps it was true after all.
<name>John</name>	John	Jimmy	ever. The paycheck would be just enough to buy them some clothes and a little food, but they had nowhere to stay, nowhere to go, and with a look of total exhaustion, she went looking for [MASK] to say good-bye to him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Zoya	He was embarrassed not to have brought her more, but he had been in a hurry that morning. And he realized again suddenly that he had never fed [MASK] that night, and wondered if she was as hungry as he was.
<name>James</name>	James	Simon	She had never had as much fun in her life as shopping with him, and [MASK] gave her an unlimited budget. They stayed at the George V, and enjoyed a few rare moments alone which were like a honeymoon for them.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Zoya	Do you wish to shoot me?” They had killed her grandson and her son, if they wished to shoot her now, they were welcome to it. But she was prepared to kill them first if they laid a hand on [MASK].
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Grandmama	She lowered her eyes toward her plate, and the others carried on their conversation without her. it was only a moment later that she looked up and realized her grandmother was there, and a smile lit up her face as she saw her. “Hello, [MASK].
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Zoya	He’s right, we must go . . . now . . . while we still can.” She looked sadly at the girl who had only moments before been a child, but she was in no way prepared for the full measure of [MASK]’s fury.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Natalya	your father’s old troika!” And then the old woman ran toward her pavilion, panting heavily and clutching [MASK]’s arm. She was shouting to her maids, telling them to gather up all the clothes in which the jewels were sewn, and throw them into bags.
<name>Masha</name>	Masha	Joy	Her own home was but a smaller version of the Anitchkov Palace, and her playmates were the people who made history, but to her it all seemed commonplace and normal. “[MASK] seems so happy now.” She watched the dog playing at her feet.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Konstantin	“Don’t be silly. Why would you think something’s wrong? What a twit you are.” But a smart one. He marveled at how she instinctively knew that he had returned to see [MASK] because he was worried.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Zoya	“I could give you a try, madame . . . Countess, I suppose I should say. You must use your title here.” “Of course.” [MASK] tried to look calm, but she wanted to shout with glee, like a child . . .
<name>James</name>	James	Clayton	The baby had his mother’s red hair, and a round face, as he lay wrapped in lace, and tears of joy ran slowly down [MASK]’s cheeks as he saw him. “Oh, he’s so beautiful ... he looks just like you . . .”
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Zoya	Trust a little bit. You must have faith.” She smiled at her gently, but there was no joy in [MASK]’s eyes anymore. She had lost too much. And she was worried about too many. “How can you still say that?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clayton	She gave a gasp as she saw him, slumped on the floor, as though he had fallen, and she ran to his side, and gently rolled him onto his back. But he stared at her with unseeing eyes. “[MASK]!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Zoya	He looked sad for a moment. “She won’t even notice.” [MASK] kissed him that time, a kiss to heal the hurt of years of loneliness. They were both lonely people now, yet their time together was always lively and happy.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Feodor	It had been grueling to travel on day after day, by ship and by train and by troika. Even [MASK] looked as though he had aged ten years in the single week, but they were also suffering from the sorrow of leaving their homeland.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Zoya	He appeared promptly at eight o’clock the following night, and rang the bell, just as [MASK] came out of her room. The apartment was small, but simple and elegant. They had very few things, but nowadays what they had was good.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marie	But she knew clothes, she had worn the best for the past ten years, and even as a child, she and [MASK] had studied everything their mothers and other relatives had worn. She knew how to put herself together with style, and perhaps she could teach others to also.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Clayton	He walked her to her door and saw her safely inside, as she waved for a last time, and darted up the stairs to the apartment. CHAPTER 16 [MASK]’s introduction to her grandmother went far more easily than either of them had dared to hope.
<name>He</name>	He	Simon	He looked worried again as she cried, “Is that what the doctor said?” “No,” she said furiously, and blew her nose, “he said ‘Congratulations!’ ” [MASK] could only laugh at her as she paced the room frantically.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Zoya	And he stared at [MASK] now, wishing they had sent someone else. She looked like a nice woman, with her red hair intricately tied in a knot, and her smile as she looked at him, not understanding what was coming.
<name>Anya</name>	Anya	Evgenia	“It was hard today.” But she didn’t mind. Dancing with the Ballet Russe made her feel alive again. “He said he’d bring you home.” [MASK] frowned. He had brought her fresh bread, and a jar of jam.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Konstantin	“This is not amusing, [MASK], and I expect you to tell her just exactly what I did. She must get rid of it at once.” “What is it, pest? A trained snake?”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Simon	Her unfailing sense of style helped him make interesting choices that otherwise he wouldn’t have thought of. “[MASK], I miss it all so much,” she confessed in December, as they took a taxi home from the theater.
<name>He</name>	He	Axelle	By the time I bathe, read the newspapers, and an occasional book, it’s all over. I’d fell asleep in my plate if anyone took me out.” [MASK] knew how hard she worked, but she was sorry for her.
<name>She</name>	She	Zoya	So here we are, safely tucked into my secret hideaway.” He planted a kiss on her open lips and then smiled at her as she stared at him. “Consider yourself abducted.” He looked immensely pleased with himself as [MASK] stared at him in amazement.
<name>James</name>	James	Nicolai	In spite of what you hear, I’m only having a little fun, nothing serious, I promise you.” “Good. Then what brought you here tonight?” [MASK] looked worried as he stared into the fire, and then into his father’s eyes.
<name>Vasily</name>	Vasily	Konstantin	And he was, just as he had been when he was younger, and his father before him. If he could, [MASK] would have been at the front himself, but he was far too old, no matter how much he loved his cousin the Tsar and his country.
<name>Elisabeth</name>	Elisabeth	Zoya	Where are the others?” The Empress smiled gratefully as her husband’s elderly cousin tossed off her cloak, and carefully turned back the cuffs of the simple dress she had worn. “Go and rest. [MASK] can keep the girls company while I see to the others.”
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Zoya	. not to mention the frivolities like holidays and parties and pretty dresses.” “Is all of that wrong?” The very idea seemed to startle [MASK]. “Certainly not. But it is a privilege, and we must never forget that.”
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Grandmama	It had come to that then. She was to be supported by the child’s dancing. It was almost beyond bearing. “What’s that for?” “[MASK], it’s for you.” “We don’t need it yet.”
