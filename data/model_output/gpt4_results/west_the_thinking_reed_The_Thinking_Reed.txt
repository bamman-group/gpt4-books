<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Maman	If she has no faith, she will tell you she believes in everything. I have noticed it in [MASK]. She has infinite faith, and she does not really believe in anything. It is very puzzling.”
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Isabelle	“I understand perfectly,” she said sullenly. “But what is this?” [MASK] asked herself in amazement. “She isn’t sorry for me! But I have said I am ill. How can she not be sorry for me?”
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Ferdy	She was pleased at that, with the nervous humility of a pregnant woman, and anyway [MASK] always amused her by the contrast between his loose spirit and the physical envelope it had inherited from a great English family of the governing classes.
<name>Valeria</name>	Valeria	Isabelle	Upon my soul, though I have no further use for you at the moment, I must admit that you are a well-made woman.” “Why,” asked [MASK], “do you have those ugly photographs of me in your room?
<name>He</name>	He	Marc	[MASK] never read a book, but these people went further. They had no dealings with printed matter at all except in the morning when they looked at the headlines of the newspapers, and on journeys, when they read illustrated papers and detective stories.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Isabelle	“Very well,” said [MASK], “I am tired, I need rest, it is six o’clock, and we are not going out until nearly nine. Go away then, and let me rest until half-past eight.”
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Andre	[MASK]’s voice called to her from the distance, “Hurry up, darling. You’ll be getting cold.” At its charm she shuddered. His good looks, his adroitness, his amiability, had lost all power to affect her.
<name>Odette</name>	Odette	Poots	“Yes, that would certainly be him.” But there was still luxury in his tone. It was apparent that nobody could cure him of his infatuation for [MASK] by giving him proofs that she was mercenary and treacherous, since these emetic qualities affected his perverse soul as aphrodisiacs.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Isabelle	But what a charming, warm friendliness there would be established between us if I could make some public, playful, yet fully masculine gesture like this.” “Darling, you do very well with the resources that you have,” said [MASK], “and there is something I must tell you.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Roy	And if I’ve been boring you with an explanation of all the whys and wherefores of this morning’s scene with the roses, it’s because I’ve wanted to appear to you with a clean sheet, since I’m a little shy about telling one of [MASK]’s friends about my new choice.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Adrienne	You’d think she was thirty, and she’ll never see forty-five again.” “Ah, hut that’s a special case,” said [MASK]. “Nothing’s ever happened to her, as we all know. That leaves a woman always like a young girl.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Andre	Pride failed in her like a physical nerve; it was as if humiliation were a kind of stroke. The farewell words she spoke to [MASK] were muddled, the movement with which she pushed open the swing door was clumsy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	After she had listened for a few minutes her eyes begem to sparkle, and she uttered little pleased exclamations. At the conversation’s end she turned to [MASK] and said, “Why, it is more fortunate than I could have hoped!
<name>Granet</name>	Granet	Philippe	“At half-past eight, then, at the Villa Sans Souci. It is in the woods not far away. That will be charming,” said [MASK], a little soothed. “My wife will be so pleased. There are several of her relatives staying there just now.
<name>Rum</name>	Rum	Philippe	“No,” said [MASK] tensely. “It is a nickname. It is really the name of a West Indian drink, but he is called that because it was the name of a racehorse that won the Derby for his father the year he was born.”
<name>Annette</name>	Annette	Isabelle	He took his hat in both hands and held it in front of him and said, “Oh, [MASK], my little one, my little cabbage, my little angel, I am very stupid, nearly everybody is cleverer than I am, I often do not understand things properly.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Isabelle	“That may be, my dear,” he said, “but you wouldn’t go down with the army, you know, the way you are now.” “Enough of that,” said [MASK], “enough of that.”
<name>Satan</name>	Satan	Hell	Those who hated her in this vile world would despise her as she despised them, which she felt to be insolence, and those who liked her would extend her a greasy leering tolerance, such as [MASK] would show to one who had arrived there after being counted on earth as a saint.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	But since [MASK] was certainly superior to herself in every way, she knew that she must possess these faults or worse. She was aware that she had a tendency to be priggish and censorious, and now she wondered in panic just how far it had gone.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Isabelle	“It is your only chance of being where you are, as my morals are not what they call special.” “No, I am speaking seriously,” said [MASK], “I detest being a woman.”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Marc	There crept over her skin like vermin the realization that she was no more exempt than any other human being from being touched by squalor. But she reflected that, if this affair were bad for her, it must be far worse for [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurence	All men have that attitude, I think j and it is only when one is being disagreeable that one pretends women are not exactly like men in their attitude to these things. So of course you will not like [MASK] getting married.”
<name>Wilbour</name>	Wilbour	Marc	THE THINKING REED cause their dusk was going to be overpopulated by Dop-pelgangers of the crowd that had camped all over their noon, she saw that her married life was going to be made as difficult by [MASK]’s wealth and position as if his work had compelled them to live in an unhealthy climate.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luba	[MASK] strolled over to a seat by the window, and pulled apart the curtains so that she could look on.the garden, which was frosted by the light from the full moon that rode among the tree-tops of the wood beyond.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Alan	“So that is what is worrying you,” said [MASK]. “I told you you were stupid.” She met the adoring impertinence in his eyes with the despair a mother feels when she comes in after some hours’ absence and finds her little boy still playing with his tin trumpet.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Isabelle	There was a moment's silence, and [MASK] turned a brilliant smile on the whole room, because her resentment that she was here and not eating bread-and-milk in bed at home became suddenly so strong that she felt it must be visible.
<name>Raoul</name>	Raoul	Isabelle	[MASK] could hear the woman begging him to remember the other occupants of the loge, who, from what she said, were certainly their friends and had probably even accompanied them to the theatre, and what they were bound to think if he and she left before the end of the performance.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Alan	She put away her handkerchief and wound her arms round his neck and said, “Oh, [MASK], forgive me for coming here to see what I could get out of you. I saw I could get heaven from you, you are so nice.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luba	We might as well have a look at them before we go down.” “And there is somebody with him. It is [MASK]. Look, she has caught her sleeve in the door. I suppose she wants to bathe with us.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isabelle	But come to the window, I have something important to show you.” She linked one arm about [MASK]’s shoulders and the other about the waist of the third plain woman, who assumed an unamused expression of amused indulgence. “Look, look!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isabelle	[MASK] went early to the doctor’s room, to tell him that she was leaving that night, and when he objected, she reminded him that he had promised her that the mountains would give her peace, and firmly assured him that they had.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Isabelle	THE KNOCKING on the door did not wake [MASK] because she had started up from sleep very early that morning. This was a new thing. Until about a fortnight before, she had slept for nine hours every night, no matter when she might have gone to bed.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Isabelle	[MASK] sighed, and the painter, who was sitting on her right, asked her the reason, and she was faintly exasperated because she had to answer him so evasively that there arose opportunities for coquetry, which he did not neglect.
<name>Michel</name>	Michel	Marc	When the Germans went, they left the works a heap of old iron on ravaged ground; and [MASK], who was THE THINKING REED twenty-four when he came back from the war, showed a curious reluctance to build them up again.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Marc	But one’s mouth, that is love.” “Yes, I can understand it now,” said [MASK], “but what horrifies me is that I made no attempt to understand it then. I was alternately amused and irritated by it. Well, well.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Chanel	She was completely destitute—she had tried to work, you know, she was at [MASK]’s for three months but she drove everybody mad—and he was grossly rich. She really had no reason to feel ashamed.”
<name>John</name>	John	Marc	But she kept on saying again and again, “I am so tired. I am so tired. I want to go to bed. I want to sleep.” And [MASK] answered, “Yes, yes, you need a great deal more rest.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Isabelle	As the lights went up one by one along the vistas that were as poignant as if seen through tears, [MASK] found her own heart aching, although she knew quite well that this melancholy was an illusion born of the time and place.
<name>Swann</name>	Swann	Marc	“Nonsense, lots of girls with just as pretty figures have to earn their livings doing acrobatics with sergeants de ville,” said [MASK]. A grimace brought down the comers of his mouth, he began to mb his stomach.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isabelle	“Oh, I don’t know,” he answered, composing his features. “Somehow or other I like them.” But he burst into uncontrollable laughter again. “I see what it is!” cried [MASK], putting her arms round his neck and shaking him.
<name>Thus</name>	Thus	Nor	Can you not leave him alone if you don’t want him?” She was obliged to answer, “No.” [MASK], she reflected, was this the sole way in which she was an exceedingly unpleasant woman.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Marc	My God, the lines running from her nose to her mouth! She will try to punish us for this, and her idea of punishment will be something as subtle as a sandbagging on a dark night. [MASK] was right, these are really dangerous people.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Marc	“[MASK], what has happened?” “Ah, what a fool I am! I did not mean to let you know, because you have such a loving heart and you want your friends to be happy. But I always give things away.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Isabelle	“Yes, indeed,” said [MASK]. “She is really the most provoking of creatures. There is hardly a line in the whole letter that is not about wild geese. Wait a minute, here is something written on the back of the envelope.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Michael	she exclaimed when [MASK] rose at an incredibly early moment, when some compote had just been put down before her, and said that he and his wife must return to their hotel to be picked up by some friends who were making an early start for the country.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Alan	She covered her eyes with her hand, not before it occurred to her how appropriate this gentle brilliance of old glass was to [MASK], to his smile, which was without reservations, like a child’s, to his fresh voice, to the unclouded translucence of his pleasantness.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Isabelle	“Why,” thought [MASK], “it must be that he’s being blackmailed.” There crept over her skin like vermin the realization that she was no more exempt than any other human being from being touched by squalor.
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Darling	“[MASK],” she murmured to him, “I feel so miserable. Take me home.” “At once, at once,” he said. “We will make our apologies as soon as these ordures of the second rank have taken their departure.”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Isabelle	She showed that she knew [MASK] was lying. Her eyes ranged slowly about the lounge, she rolled her cigarette-holder backwards and THE THINKING REED forwards in her mouth, the pace of her breathing deliberate and contented and voluptuous.
<name>Lucian</name>	Lucian	Marc	Her first desire was to call [MASK] with a loud cry and weep on his breast. But it was surely impossible that anything which worked through the acknowledged mechanism of ordinary life, and that at its most trivial, should be sinister enough to justify such distress.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Ferdy	“That is not to be borne.” [MASK] hovered over them, making benedictory noises, and sat down, heavily, splendidly, the Viceroy about to spend a few friendly moments with the native princes. The consent of the native princes is taken for granted on these occasions.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Isabelle	Well, he has caused a lot of talk by being married to a member of one of them, and he will cause a lot more when he is cocu by her.” “He is very different from his father and mother,” said [MASK].
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Isabelle	No, I don’t think the mere physical act of maternity could have done anything to her. Why should it? It’s not having children that’s good for people, it’s the way they live with them.” “Yes,” said [MASK].
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Marc	On the brink of it stood the innkeeper and [MASK], looking into the water and wagging their heads, plainly exchanging platitudes, as Frenchmen do, for the pleasure of feeling their mouths full of the good meat of common sense.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Marc	But just then [MASK] came to a standstill in front of them, beaming with satisfaction at the treat he had given his partner, though it was apparent from her dishevelment that what pleasure she had felt at his attentions had for some time been obliterated by sheer physical pain.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Isabelle	You’d have thought she was fighting for her last crust, not the miners’, from the way she carried on.” “If the poor ever feel poor as the rich do,” said [MASK], “we will have a most bloody revolution.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Marc	Do you not think so yourself?” He did not answer but sank back into his arm-chair. Panic filled her, the room became black, she flung herself dow'n between his knees and cried, “[MASK], you have not begun to like the idea during the day?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Marc	But what horrified her in the scene was that [MASK] made not one movement of protest against the steady rain of insult. Sometimes he put his elbows on his knees and rested his head in his hands, but that was plainly in order to gain self-control.
<name>Titian</name>	Titian	Giorgione	Then he would be seen looking out under the broad brows of the mansarded windows purged of his triviality and restlessness by the censorship of man’s romanticizing memory, dark and beautiful and grave with consideration of private delights, like a young man painted by [MASK].
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Isabelle	“This is not to be borne.” [MASK] saw that his face had become purple, and braced herself to teach him to exercise more self-control. “It is impossible that anything so little serious cannot be borne,” she told him crisply.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Isabelle	[MASK] kept her eyes on him as he whirled the elderly lady round and round the room, watching him with tender amusement, for though he danced quite neatly, he infected every dance with the bounce and hop of the polka.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	“But I will eat some potato chips,” she said, constrained by her immense hunger, though she knew they were too salt for her. “They are showing themselves extraordinarily ill bred,” said [MASK], pushing the dish towards her.
<name>Waterloo</name>	Waterloo	Sadowa	That had happened, but so had the battle of [MASK]; neither event touched any nerve in her mind, her life would have gone on in the same way had all her knowledge of them been excised. It was because she had known exactly how he would smile at her when they met.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Marc	She looked about and found the Siamese cat drawing its claws down the back of [MASK]’s chair. Whipping it up, she said to the maitre d’hotel, “Could you find any use for this cat if we gave it to you?”
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Isabelle	[MASK] said nervously, crossing her hands on her breast, “You are making too much of the mystery, I do not think there are many women to be made out of me. I am as clear as glass, you know everything about me. . . .”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Andre	First she put [MASK]’s flowers in the waste-paper basket, and then looked at the card to be quite sure they had come from him. “Darling, last night you were more wonderful than ever,” he had written, and she groaned aloud.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	So just let us make up our minds to see the business through, and the less fuss we make the better we will feel.” “Oh, you are clever,” said [MASK]. “You are always cleverer than anybody else.”
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Death	But even if it had been an ordinary child, [MASK] should not have taken it, for it was absolutely necessary, if the universe was not to be a chaos of pain, that parents should die before their children.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Laurence	Those books had made her wonder if she might not work out some spiritual equivalent of the Einstein theory regarding the re-entrant nature of time, for it was plainly through reading these writers of the remote past that [MASK] owed his serene command over the present.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Laurence	Lowering her eyelids she spoke it out. “No, not romantic! One would have to be starved of all pleasantness, a tired, homely stenographer or an old hospital nurse, to think it romantic. It is a very silly story, [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Isabelle	THE THINKING REED great cities; and [MASK] wondered if it could not be that a man could fall into grandeur, as he can fall into misery, simply because he cannot satisfy the demands that society makes on those who petition it for a modest living.
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Isabelle	Ah, these great men, they’re all alike, they all have their little ways.” [MASK] picked up the photographs from the dressing-table and the others from the writing-table, the mantelpiece, the wall between the windows, and went out of the room.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Marc	And when she told him this he said, “Well, darling, perhaps it’s not so bad. For a factory, it’s a factory.” Yes, [MASK] was a great man or, at least, a great indus- irialist.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	“Let go,” said [MASK]. “Let go. I do not want to lose my place at the table.” She shuddered, but not at his unkindness. She had realized that the plan demanded from her the kind of behaviour she found most repellent.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Marc	She said aloud, “[MASK], I must come home.” Then she looked at herself anxiously in the pierglass of the wardrobe opposite her bed, for she was aware that she was undertaking an immensely difficult task.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marc	“I am really quite happy. Indeed, at the very moment you spoke, I was thinking how fortunate we would be if we never had any worse troubles than this.” “It is charming of you to take it all so lightly,” said [MASK].
<name>Hein</name>	Hein	Marc	“I have never felt more contented than I am here. I feel like a cat in its basket. I could stay here all night.” “Hein,” said [MASK]. The dusk became night, and the world became blacker but less vague.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Isabelle	“I come to see if you go swimming?” “In a minute,” cried [MASK]. “And we were only saying we hoped you would look in and come too. But just let’s look at our mail.”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Isabelle	It doesn’t seem to be in any trouble, it’s just standing there. What an extraordinary thing. I wonder why on earth it’s raising that din.” “To torment our humanitarian feelings,” said [MASK].
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Adrienne	“And you should go back to the country. One doesn’t get over a bad illness in a day, you know.” “Give her a glass of water,” said [MASK]. “Alio! Alio!”
<name>Machine</name>	Machine	REED	He wanted to form part of a pattern. The confidence with which he was telling her this, plainly a slow agony to his natural reserve, proved all the assurances he had THE THINKING [MASK] made her that his feelings for her were of the utmost seriousness.
<name>She</name>	She	Nancy	It was incredible that he should be so schoolboyish, so uninitiate. After all, [MASK] must at some time or other have received some sort of attacking proposition. She said lightly, “Well, what have you been doing this morning?”
<name>She</name>	She	Isabelle	[MASK], felt placidly that she need no longer listen, and retired into comfortable speculations as to what her child would be like. As soon as decently might be after lunch, she left them and went upstairs to sleep and awoke late in the afternoon.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Isabelle	“We always have something to say to each other. It’s extraordinary how the time passes when we’re together. It must be quite late, it’s time I left you to rest.” “No—don’t go for a minute,” said [MASK].
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Alan	It is beating now.” She took her hand away from him and covered her throat. She still could not look at him. “You are the most nervous and fragile human being I’ve ever known,” said [MASK]. “It frightens me, I wish to God
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	Michel	Perhaps she was being watched. She longed to turn round and run out of the courtyard, but a peculiar motion which [MASK] had made with his right hand, and a canny narrowing of his eyes, had filled her with alarm.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	One	He murmured sympathetically, “Yes. Yes. I know. [MASK] doesn’t see it, the thing that governs people . . .” “And I had, you know, other ideas. I wanted to make something decent of my life.
<name>Stanhope</name>	Stanhope	Napoleon	There are men that way too, like [MASK]. I don’t suppose anybody would call him a good man, but his soldiers didn’t ask anything better than to follow him. The great thing to remember is that they get tired, that sort of people.
<name>She</name>	She	Isabelle	[MASK] whispered, “That is so.” “I suppose it is the child,” he said. “Yes, my womb hates you,” she said. Tears began to flow down her cheeks, but after a moment’s effort she found that this did not prevent her from going on talking.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Marc	That was not how love was supposed to begin. In fact, this was an uncharted universe. But [MASK] was saying something, speaking very indistinctly, his lips against the palm of his hand. “What is it?” she asked, kneeling at his feet.
<name>Annushka</name>	Annushka	Isabelle	But tell me more about this name. I have never heard it before, though it is charming, of course. Do you,” he asked, turning to [MASK], “have such a name in your country?” “It is perhaps a nickname?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isabelle	One man, not ill-dressed or unhandsome, turned about after he had looked into [MASK]’s face, walked at her heels for a time, and then addressed her gallantly; but his voice betrayed that he was quite old and there was no urgency in his gesture.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Poots	“The English earl who writes gossip notes for a Sunday paper.” As they watched the young man, they saw him turn to [MASK] with a question and heard her answer, “The Benny d’Alperoussas, of course.”
<name>Trantor</name>	Trantor	Marc	There was no hint of poverty here, but nothing communally owned or public was handsome. The principal square was a waste of ragged grass, which supported nakedly the plate glass and chromium band- stand [MASK] had built as a memorial to his father.
<name>Clacton</name>	Clacton	Marc	She had contrived that violence should not make her life a tragedy. It might yet make her life a farce, which she would find hardly more tolerable. They went out on the terrace, [MASK]’s fingers opening and closing on her wrist, to the man who had brought this on her.
<name>Gwendolen</name>	Gwendolen	Isabelle	Worse than that, it had confused [MASK]’s ideas of what might be reckoned as good fortune. She had been stunned at finding that a passionate love-affair was not, as her marriage had led her to believe, a prescription for general happiness.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Marc	[MASK] halted and stared up at her from his umbrella. “But, my God!” he muttered. “It is only that I am tired,” she said. “I am so tired that I feel faint. After all I should not have come out so soon.”
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Luba	Like such rich men as are not mean, it was his habit to carry a great deal of money on him, sometimes as much as sixty thousand francs; he must have bought at least that amount of chips, counting those he had already given to [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Marc	[MASK] came, on one of these last who had been a friend of his mother many years before; and such was his mood of melting benevolence that he greeted her with civilities which might have been mistaken for the first frolics of an infatuation.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Alan	“But I do, I do,” she murmured, moving away from the easel. “I’m telling you that I don’t care whether you do or don’t,” said [MASK]. He was fiddling with some paint on the canvas and spoke without looking round at her.
