<name>Valerie</name>	Valerie	Celia	“But you know the Royal Air Force Tempest squadron takes down as many flying bombs in the air as the gunners do on the ground, and [MASK] was in a Tempest—” “She didn’t have any guns,” I said. “She wasn’t armed.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maddie	By accident or on purpose. Did I save that German laddie’s life yesterday, or destroy it? You do it too—you tell the fighters where to find them. You’re responsible. Do you think about it?” [MASK] didn’t answer.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Maddie	[MASK] and the other WAAFs in her barracks still hadn’t got proper uniforms, but as it was winter, they had been issued RAF overcoats—men’s overcoats. Warm and waterproof, but ridiculous. Like wearing a tent.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Shakespeare	He is said to be another of my unlikely ancestors, and actually did hold court on my family’s estate from time to time. He was not, by all contemporary Scottish accounts, the treacherous bastard [MASK] makes him out to be.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Maddie	Flying a broken plane for two hours then landing a fixed one in twenty yards in the same day—we might as well be operational.” All right, this airfield, the Special Duties airfield. It is the same one [MASK] and I took off from six weeks ago.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Queenie	She’s been playing daft games all morning—” They all sat down. “Her suggestion,” said [MASK]. “The daft games.” “It was my suggestion, but only because she’s so utterly rubbish at finding her way anywhere.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Julie	Perhaps he’s been told to kill [MASK]. But I think he’s just as likely been told to stage her death, so she disappears again. Sharing cognac with her and sending her to the guillotine in the same week? I just don’t believe it.
<name>Maverick</name>	Maverick	Jamie	They only let us fly operational aircraft when they get desperate. And they’re always harder on us when we botch something.” All true, and what I said next was true too, but a bit petty—“You even get to keep your BOOTS and mine are BURNT” [MASK] burst out laughing.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Maddie	If we bounce I don’t want to be strangled in electric wire. And if I have to jump out before you try to land, I jolly well don’t want it trailing out after me and smacking me in the head.” [MASK] said nothing.
<name>Orville</name>	Orville	Nick	“How do you topple a doodlebug?” I asked. “The girls say you can do it with your wingtip.” [MASK] laughed. Then he paused. I didn’t say anything because I knew he was thinking. “You couldn’t,” he said at last.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Mitraillette	I don’t actually remember what happened. I don’t remember attacking him. But the skin of my knuckles is torn where my fist connected with his broken teeth. [MASK] says they thought I was going to try to dig his eyes out with my fingers.
<name>She</name>	She	Amelie	They didn’t know what was going on or they’d have never gone to look, [MASK] says, but they arrived just as it was happening and they saw it. SAW IT HAPPEN. She has been sobbing her heart out all evening, impossible to comfort her.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Maddie	Then runway, wind speed, visibility—” She scratched notes furiously. The wireless operator stared at the coded abbreviations, then spoke into the headset, giving orders in German with confident calm. She paused mid-flow and jabbed a perfectly manicured fingernail into the script [MASK] had passed to her.
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Maddie	I don’t want to think about it. I expect they can take the MBE away if you stop being chivalrous.) If they were radio equipped, [MASK] could talk to the planes the special duties clerks saw on their screens.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kittyhawk	I don’t know if they normally work on a Sunday afternoon or if the noise was laid on specially for us. “It is a pity we cannot keep you, [MASK],” said the man whose house it was. “You were born to be a soldier.”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Julie	[MASK] stood cowering, white as paper in the harsh glare of the floodlight, staring straight ahead of her at nothing. She was next. She knew it. We all knew it. But they weren’t finished with their second victim yet.
<name>Big Brother</name>	Big Brother	Julie	I know, because [MASK] made me read it—partly, I am dead sure, as a warning about how both of us were being fine-tuned for the war machine by that Bloody Machiavellian Intelligence Officer whose real name she also knows perfectly well.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Queenie	“I can name ten.” “Go on, then.” [MASK] looked at her hands. “Breaking my nails,” she said critically. After two hours’ clearing the runway of rubble and twisted metal, her manicure was in need of repair.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Kittyhawk	I know he is dead sick with worry about her too and was being brave to make me brave, so I nodded. He wiped my cheeks with his thumbs. “Good girl. Buck up, [MASK]! Not like you to blub.”
<name>the pilot</name>	the pilot	Maddie	They were gaining height again. “Climbing on purpose now,” [MASK] said grimly. “I’ll take you up to 3000 feet. Don’t want to go higher or I’ll never get back down. You’ll be able to jump safely.”
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Gran	Sort of thing you do when you’re ten, about the age I took [MASK]’s gramophone to bits. The list of birds makes me sad. What changes a small boy from a bird-watcher into a Gestapo inquisitor?
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Felicyta	She had a plate of toast cut up in one-inch squares with a bit of margarine and the tiniest blob of strawberry jam on each square—simple but pretty. “We make do with not much, as usual,” [MASK] said, and tried to smile.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Paul	They kept moving and flashing their electric torches into our faces—or where they thought our faces were—occasionally blinding us. I discovered later that I’d bitten my thumbnails down to their bleeding nail beds waiting for [MASK]’s planned assault from behind. It never came.
<name>James</name>	James	Jamie	It’s not a big squadron. Volunteer for RAF Special Duties, and if you need a reference, ask to talk to—” The name she gave [MASK] was the alias of the intelligence officer who recruited me. It was probably the most daring thing she’d ever done.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Kittyhawk	“Sorry, sorry!” he hissed in my ear. “First thing I thought of—didn’t want to blow your cover, [MASK]! Won’t do it again, I promise—” Then we were both overcome with silliness, giggling like idiots.
<name>her</name>	her	Celia	So cheap and ugly. Them paying for the meal and me trying to think of anything to say about [MASK] apart from ‘She was a nice girl but she never talked to anybody.’” “I know. I felt that way too.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Maddie	[MASK], nothing if not mechanically minded and trained to react positively to orders from people in authority, clawed her way up the gun. “That slip of a lass’ll never shift that shell,” croaked the gunner. “Weighs thirty pounds, that does.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Queenie	Seven, ghosts—I mean one ghost, not seven, one particular ghost. I don’t need to worry about that here. The ghost is probably why I’m scared of the dark too.” [MASK] washed back these unlikely confessions with more tea.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Maddie	“I don’t think our gun did that,” [MASK] told her friend, whey-faced, as the black, oily smoke rose from the turnip field where the plane had come down. “It must have been one of our lot, firing from the air.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	STOOGE	(You see—it was just like being in school.) [MASK] That is not a WAAF trade. That is what they call it when you go along in an aircraft just for the ride and don’t meaningfully contribute to a successful flight.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Maddie	I’m not flying at the minute.” He spoke without bitterness. [MASK] asked a question she’d wanted to ask him when she’d first met him, only she hadn’t had the courage. “How did you ever manage to save your hands?”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Julie	She will lead them blind. “Oui, mais oui, oh, yes!” I stuttered, a bit too hysterically, and everybody frowned at me. I handed both photos back— the one that will break [MASK] and the one that could save her.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Eva	Occasionally I pulled Very Useful Information out of my “clients.” Location of airfields. Aircraft types. Code. Things like that. At any rate, after that April interview, everyone, including [MASK], agreed that she needed a change of scene.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Queenie	Six to go.” “All right.” [MASK] deliberately tore her bun into six equal pieces and arranged them around the rim of her saucer. Then, one by one, she dunked each piece into her tea, named a fear, and ate it.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Balliol	If I ever hear either tune being played in some public place I am sure I will immediately start to howl. So then [MASK] and I had another session and it got a bit more technical, me having to remember names and numbers I didn’t know
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Etienne	At the back of the drawer was a super Swiss pocketknife with a tin opener and screwdriver attachment, and this notebook—a school exercise jotter dated fifteen years ago. [MASK]’s written out a list of local birds on the first three pages.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Queenie	“You translate for prisoners of war? You work for Intelligence—you translate at interrogations?” [MASK] hid herself in a cloud of smoke. “I’m not a translator,” she said. “But you said—” “No.”
<name>Beryl</name>	Beryl	Felicyta	She couldn’t even tell the radio room what was wrong as she was coming in to land. “You do not need guns,” [MASK] insisted passionately, her eyes blazing. “The mechanic says if you fly fast enough you can ram a pilotless plane with your wingtip.”
<name>her</name>	her	Maddie	Anyone with a screen going. I need an ident on a radio call—” Everyone crowded around the telephone, reading over [MASK]’s shoulder as she took notes from the direction finding station, then gasping aloud as the meaning of her notes sank in.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Paul	Had to cling to him for dear life for five miles. Bet he loved that. The car was late meeting us—the driver had to avoid an unexpected patrol—[MASK] and I stood for half an hour shivering and stamping around in the drainage ditch where we hid the bicycle.
<name>Violette</name>	Violette	Maddie	I was getting a bit weary of those flipping recipe cards. We are still using them for the other work. WARTIME ADMINISTRATIVE FORMALITIES I am condensing now. I can’t write fast enough. [MASK] was being groomed by the SOE long before she became aware of it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Paul	But all [MASK]’s fooling about did give me a good look at her. She’s tall, about my age, dark brown hair in a severe crimped bob, a bit old-fashioned. Astonishing pale green eyes.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Celia	An ATA pilot couldn’t topple a V-l flying bomb.” “[MASK] did. She tried to, anyway. We think that’s why she crashed. How do they do it? Do you just bash it with your wing-tip?
<name>Beryl</name>	Beryl	Maddie	Our reconnaissance planes are tarted up in a lovely salmony-mauve camouflage to match the clouds. So let’s say [MASK] was flying a pink Spitfire, but not up to the soaring blue heavens like the fighter pilots.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Engel	1 smiled like an idiot and spoke half a dozen of the two dozen words I know in German. “Verzeihung, aber Sie haben Ihren Lippenstift fallengelassen—” Excuse me, you dropped your lipstick. The captain was already inside the car and [MASK] hadn’t opened her own door yet.
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Queenie	“And Not Getting the Uniform Right— my hair’s always too long, you’re not allowed to alter the coat so it’s always too big, things like that. And: Southerners laughing at my accent.” “Och aye,” [MASK] agreed.
<name>Goose</name>	Goose	Theo	“It’ll be fun,” [MASK] repeated enthusiastically, encouraging her. “You couldn’t get better training if they gave you a course! Flying a broken plane for two hours then landing a fixed one in twenty yards in the same day—we might as well be operational.”
<name>The pilot</name>	The pilot	Michael	“What’s that!” she gasped into the intercom. [MASK] saw it at the same time and banked sharply away. He began to circle, a hair too steeply at first, then with steadier rudder control.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Mitraillette	I don’t bloody care if there is. I want to get it right while I remember. [MASK] tried to dose me with knockout drops again a few minutes ago—30 minutes to oblivion. But this time I’m wise to her and I want to write.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Queenie	I felt dead sorry for him.” “Yes, I did too,” said [MASK] softly, and swallowed the last of her tea as if she were throwing back a dram of whisky. “Was it beastly awful, questioning him?”
<name>Anneliese</name>	Anneliese	Isolde	I asked in German, in a voice of wonder and hurt as though it had only just occurred to me, “What is your daughter’s name: “[MASK],” he answered softly, his guard down, and went red as a beetroot.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Kittyhawk	“Get a grip on yourself, [MASK],” he hissed. “We need you. You’re a crack shot but no one’s expecting you to kill anybody. Focus on tools, all right? They’ll start trying to fix things in a moment.
<name>the pilot</name>	the pilot	Maddie	Ground crew, caps pulled low and faces hidden in the wing’s shadow, helped the passenger in and fastened her harness. There was no baggage apart from the indispensable gas mask in its haversack, and as usual [MASK] wasn’t told her special passenger’s name.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Maddie	The farmer’s wife came in again, with a patch and a bucket to fill with water so they could find the puncture, and [MASK] quickly pulled down the blackout curtains over her bright and vulnerable soul and went off to sort out the tire.
<name>the pilot</name>	the pilot	Kathe	Dead casual. Informal and cheeky, as though I were a little girl. As she drove away I remembered that [MASK] isn’t supposed to understand English. Fly the plane. I wish I could, I wish, I WISH I HAD CONTROL.
<name>she</name>	she	Dympna	He glanced up at [MASK] as she approached and gave a laugh, and exclaimed in a broad American accent, “Well, look what we have here— three gorgeous English gals to fly with!” “Yankee idiot!” cursed the youthful blue-kilted bomber pilot.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Maddie	Is the sign up?” “What sign?” “A jar of rowan berries in the window—if there’s no rowan in the window I won’t be welcome.” [MASK] burst out laughing. “You are daft!” “Is there?”
<name>he</name>	he	Hardy	But whatever he actually said, [MASK] did kiss him. Where I fail in accuracy, I hope I make up for it in plausibility. There are many people who helped to make this book complete and perfect, and they all deserve tremendous thanks.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jacques	See me, cowering in the corner in my wrist and leg irons, clutching my armful of blank recipe cards and trying not to notice what they were doing to [MASK]’s fingers and toes with bits of hot metal and tongs.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Queenie	The small, comforting hand gripping her shoulder suddenly let go. U'T1 ” 1 here. [MASK] pointed. How she’d spotted it through the pagesized gap in the bulkhead was a mystery, but she’d seen the signal, a little to the left of them.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Maddie	The WAAF officers were quartered in the gatehouse lodge at the edge of the estate grounds that the airfield had been built on, and [MASK] and her bunk mates were so dead asleep they didn’t hear the sirens. They only woke up after the first explosion.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Kittyhawk	But he said it in English so that I could understand it, and no one else would except the photographer. “[MASK] won’t mind trousers. What she’s got between her legs she doesn’t use anyway.” I hate him.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Julie	Another good example is the use of the term Nacht und Nebel, which refers to the Nazi policy of making certain political prisoners vanish as though into “night and fog.” The term was so secret that it’s highly unlikely [MASK] would have ever heard it.
<name>Smithers</name>	Smithers	Brodatt	“The shell needs to be loaded first,” the gunner whispered, lifting a finger to point. “The Prime Minister don’t like girls firing guns.” “Bother the Prime Minister!” exclaimed the superior officer. “Load the damned gun, [MASK].”
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Queenie	[MASK]’s stance was different, her feet slightly farther apart and flat on the floor, her shoulders squared back. Perhaps more like a drill sergeant than her Eton-educated older brother, but certainly more man than any WAAF flight officer.
<name>Bree</name>	Bree	Maddie	The thuggish lad used it like a goading stick, and it worked. [MASK] shoved the front wheel of the bike past the one she had hit in the first place, and knocked into him again, and he grabbed the handlebars with his own big fists between her hands.
<name>Philby</name>	Philby	Michael	But she knew [MASK]’s route had been carefully plotted to avoid guns and airfields, and that their most dangerous moment had probably been when they crossed the shipping convoy. If they made it home safely, there would be no need for court-martial.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Nelson	However, prisoners at the Ravensbriick concentration camp knew they were designated “NN,” and by the end of 1944 they knew what it meant, too. [MASK]’s last words, also, are a subject of some considerable debate.
<name>Quinn</name>	Quinn	Maddie	“She won’t be strong enough. With the tail set for takeoff yon slip of a lass won’t be able to hold the stick hard for’ard enough for landing. Don’t know if anyone could.” “Someone landed it here,” [MASK] pointed out.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Felicyta	You need to read this before you write the report.” “Is it secret?” I had to ask because so many things are confidential. “No, it is not secret, but—” [MASK] took a deep breath.
<name>Verity</name>	Verity	Paul	And for good measure I remembered to say in French: “Je suis desolee!” Oh, what a mess. They helped me sit up and tried to get the mud off me. “This’ll be our Verity,” the SOE organizer [MASK] said in English.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Maddie	[MASK] switched off the torch and stared out the window, her night vision ruined by trying to read the map. But she could tell they had turned back. “You didn’t need my help after all,” she said, and passed him back his torch and map.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Beryl	“Won’t your granddad do it for you?” “He wouldn’t even give it to me until I’d taken the engine apart. I have to do it myself or 1 can’t have it.” “I still love him,” [MASK] shouted.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Taran	She tried to, anyway. We think that’s why she crashed. How do they do it? Do you just bash it with your wing-tip? The Polish pilots have a word for it. [MASK]. Aerial ramming.” Another longish pause.
<name>Maxime</name>	Maxime	Engel	She is so sharp. It took her twenty minutes during her school dinner break, and she left the pages for me to collect so she wouldn’t get caught carrying them around. It was probably a mistake to tell her to leave them in [MASK]’s cachette.
<name>Tintin</name>	Tintin	Maddie	Well ... a bit bigger. And quite a lot more powerful. And it’s a monoplane, with a retractable undercarriage—” [MASK] gave an incredulous bark of laughter. “Not so different!” “But I’ll take care of the undercarriage.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Could	[MASK] hear them chatting with the groundskeeper. He came back later to lock up the boathouse and give us the all-clear—such as it was—now there were Nazi guards posted on the front drive, so we’d not be getting the Rosalie out any time soon.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Maddie	God, this is a funny list. If I knew or cared a damned thing about aircraft types I would be flying planes for the Air Transport Auxiliary, like [MASK], the pilot who dropped me here, or working as a fitter or a mechanic.
<name>she</name>	she	Engel	We used to write secret messages in milk. It’s easy. I don’t know what [MASK] used, but she wrote in French, so I don’t remember her exact words. She’s either tipped us off or betrayed us. We won’t know which till later tonight.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Maddie	“Wish I’d brought a brolly,” she drawled in the plummy, educated tones of the Oxbridge colleges. “Super idea! A portable illusion of shelter and safety. Have you room for two?” [MASK] took the cigarette but did not immediately move over.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Paul	I was just mad as a hornet because I knew what was wrong with the car and they wouldn’t let me do anything about it. When the car stopped for the fifth time I climbed over [MASK] and got out.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Maddie	Fitful sunlight, low on the horizon, gleamed through the heavy cloud in the west, and [MASK], rather desperate to improve the experience for her suffering passenger, was able to climb a little higher, where the wind was brisker and not so gusty.
<name>her</name>	her	Amelie	You get searched when you enter the building, of course, but not on the way out, and they didn’t even look at [MASK]’s ID—she said she was working on a project for school, easy peasy.
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Jamie	She wouldn’t have recognized him as [MASK]—tonight he was the picture of rosy health, nothing like the gray-faced, grieving invalid she’d last seen slumping bandaged and unresponsive in a Bath chair. But she’d never have doubted he was her best friend’s brother.
<name>Miss Stoner</name>	Miss Stoner	Verity	[MASK], I mean. I shot her myself.” He put his own cup down on the desk with a clatter and stared at me. “I beg your pardon?” “I’m afraid of being tried for murder.”
<name>Anne Frank</name>	Anne Frank	Julie	I have looked and looked and I have got my ATA Authorization Card, but my license and National Registration card are gone, and in their place are [MASK]’s ration coupons and forged carte d’identite—photograph doesn’t really look like her, she’s wearing her fair and scary Nazi spy face.
<name>Faust</name>	Faust	Faust	He has been chewing over this idea that I can “buy” time in exchange for bits of my soul, and he wondered if I likened myself to [MASK]. Nothing like an arcane literary debate with your tyrannical master while you pass the time leading to your execution.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Maddie	With her slender manicured fingers she offered [MASK] her cigarette. “Wish I’d brought a brolly,” she drawled in the plummy, educated tones of the Oxbridge colleges. “Super idea! A portable illusion of shelter and safety. Have you room for two?”
<name>2CV</name>	2CV	Rosalie	We left all the bikes and the car hidden—it is the same Citroen [MASK], I don’t know how the man who owns it avoids being found out or at least having his car impounded, and I think he is too old for this kind of job anyway.
<name>what</name>	what	Julie	but I hadn’t much clue what was going on and was neither useful nor necessary at this point. Was also developing a splitting headache, anxious about [MASK], and wondering why they didn’t just set the dratted plane on fire and get it over with.
<name>Beryl</name>	Beryl	Maddie	She loved that, like being a goldfish alone in an empty sky. Once they had to lift her out of the plane after landing because she was shaking so badly she couldn’t climb down herself. [MASK]’s Wellington joyrides were not exactly clandestine, but they weren’t exactly cricket either.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maddie	As long as we don’t go anywhere more than five miles away, so I can get back sharpish if the weather clears. But look at it—” [MASK] waved at the window. It was pouring, rain coming down in sheets, a gale blowing.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Queenie	“I’m not a translator,” she said. “But you said—” “No.” [MASK] was quiet too. “You said that. I told you I speak German. But I’m not a translator. I’m an interrogator.”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Engel	We had fun doing the prescriptions. Will it get her in trouble if I mention that she burned a few herself to get rid of them this time? That’ll teach you to try to make a chum of me, On-Duty-Female-Guard [MASK].
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Maddie	Yes!” They both gave spontaneous yells. “I can’t let go to give them the answer!” [MASK] gasped. “Have you got an electric torch?” “In my kit. Hang on—what’s the letter to answer them?”
<name>Miss Ada</name>	Miss Ada	Mitraillette	The old woman is the one the circuit is named for. [MASK] says that before the war the woman was quite a noted horticulturalist— the chauffeur/groundskeeper is in fact a skilled gardener—and she has bred and named a few of the roses herself.
<name>Victor</name>	Victor	Kittyhawk	So even if they know your name they won’t know what you look like. Tell me, [MASK], how convincing do you think these pictures are? Would you recognize yourself? Would anyone else?” That melted corpse was hardly even recognizable as a human being.
<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Queenie	It was true that every now and then you passed a concrete gun emplacement or watchtower, but mostly you were just traveling through rolling, chalky fields, green with turnips and potatoes and mile upon mile of orchards. “You might have brought your brolly,” [MASK] said.
<name>Miller</name>	Miller	Brodatt	We were biting our nails, practicing. Waiting. TELEPHONIST “You! Girl in the blue cardigan!” Five girls in headsets looked around from their switch-boards, pointed to their chests, and mouthed silently, Me.7 “Yes, you! Aircraftwoman [MASK]!
<name>her</name>	her	Amelie	and she’s managed to be sick in her own hair.” I tell [MASK] not to think about it. Then I tell myself not to think about it. Then 1 tell myself I must think about it. It is REAL. It is happening NOW.
