<name>Don</name>	Don	Forsyth	“And those guys traveled solo, and you walked down the steps of the Constellation across the tarmac into a taxi, and checked into a hotel by signing the register. Those pillbox hats on the stewardesses, though...” [MASK] ignored him.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Marta	She is falling behind in her assigned work. Her written reports are unsatisfactory. Leave her alone. Or I will take measures.” Accustomed to and unaffected by the phlegmy bellows of Soviet officialdom, [MASK] calmly leaned forward and stubbed her cigarette in the ashtray on his desk.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Dominika	He needed to turn a corner, and right now. They chatted for a minute while looking at the improbable oversized menus. “You are quiet tonight,” said [MASK], looking at him over the top of the menu. Same majestic purple.
<name>She</name>	She	Dominika	It rolled off the bed onto the floor. The killer ignored the corpse, reaching over to the controls to stop the bed. [MASK] made to get up, but the figure in black put his hand on her shoulder and pushed her gently back onto the bed.
<name>Admiral</name>	Admiral	Korchnoi	“There was a time” said [MASK], testing her, “when women were excluded from the Academy. There was a time when it would have been unthinkable for a junior officer to read into an ongoing operation, much less comment on it.”
<name>Boris</name>	Boris	Ustinov	Tall, heavily built, with a shock of black hair and a lantern jaw, [MASK] was a leading member of the fraternity of gangster Russian oil and mining oligarchs who had amassed billion-dollar empires in the boom years after the Cold War.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Dominika	[MASK] walked slowly up to the foot of the bed, wondering how to start. She remembered how good it felt when trainers had rubbed their inflamed feet at the ballet academy, so she knelt and rubbed her thumbs hard across the arch of his foot.
<name>Natalia</name>	Natalia	Dominika	She sat gripping the edge of her desk, head bowed. This is some hothead, thought her colleagues. They had heard [MASK]’s voice raised. Was she some kind of fool? Best to keep away from this samoubiystvo, this suicide waiting to happen, they all thought.
<name>the CIA</name>	the CIA	MARBLE	And the file listed the names of the young men and women, [MASK]’s handlers, case officers of the snowy streets and the flyblown lobbies and the ringing stairways, all moved on, some upward, some not.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Marta	The apartment had been used by generations of Russian Embassy employees and was dingy and worn, the furniture scarred and wobbly. [MASK] stumbled as she took off her wet shoes. She giggled to herself. She was tipsy after a long night alone in a small cafe.
<name>DIVA</name>	DIVA	Forsyth	Look forward to future progress. Kudos. 3. In light ref developments, solicit updated Station ops plan and ops tests contemplated for future DIVA contact. Please advise next scheduled meeting and security measures planned. Hqs standing by to consult on possible next steps. [MASK] knew the signs.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Gable	The restaurant was nearly empty. [MASK] had insisted on ordering rogan josh, fragrant, spicy, oily vermilion lamb stew. They ate it with soft bread, a fiery relish of tomatoes and ginger, and copious amounts of beer.
<name>she</name>	she	Dominika	Her face flushed at being spoken to that way, but she turned away, cursing herself. She was learning. As she was being evaluated, [MASK] began courses on the psychology of intelligence collection, the psyche of sources, on understanding human motivations and identifying vulnerabilities.
<name>James</name>	James	dushka	Her breath caught in her chest; she willed herself to stay still. Their eyes met, and she gave an imperceptible shake of her head. No, [MASK], she willed her thought to reach him through the glass. Let me go.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Nate	The case is well established, the illegal has been in place for some years—five, I estimate.” “Are there any other details to identify him?” asked [MASK]. “None. But there is something else that might be related.
<name>strategy</name>	strategy	DIVA	“Those tunics and boots, they looked—” “Is this your idea of operational coaching? Are we discussing [MASK]?” “Well, you have to find something to jolt her out of her defensive position.” He leaned back in his chair, rocking slightly, hands behind his head.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dominika	[MASK] commenced taking photographs of classified Russian documents from within the rezidentura using a variety of concealed cameras installed in purses, key fobs, lipsticks. She was discerning in photographing only the best documents, flexible enough to know when to wait.
<name>Ava</name>	Ava	Dominika	She snapped the concealment cover closed, and shut the briefcase lid with a click. [MASK] paused to look at herself in the mirror, patted her hair, and then looked up at the vent and into the invisible camera.
<name>he</name>	he	Dominika	My superior also scolds.” She could feel her heartbeat in her ears. She took a swallow of wine, felt it light up her stomach. “So we’re both in hot water. What did you do?” “It’s not important,” [MASK] said.
<name>mother</name>	mother	Dominika	We will release you from the Service, close your file, cancel your pension, and withdraw your privileges—all of them” How many times will my mother’s neck be put into the noose? thought [MASK]. What else would they make her do to let her serve with honor?
<name>David</name>	David	Delon	At least it would look that way from across the room. [MASK] ordered a glass of wine while he looked at the menu. The young man sitting across from him paid his check, wiped his mouth, and reached for his jacket on the back of his chair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nate	Then a look at the clock; she’d better get home. She didn’t open the door, waited a beat, pulling up her collar. “Good luck tomorrow,” she said. And she’s the one under the blade, thought [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Nate	You’re a courageous woman running terrible risks.” Jesus, tell her how long she has to live, thought [MASK]. “Remember,” the Director said, giving her a hug, his arm across her chest, “call me anytime in case of need.”
<name>Arya</name>	Arya	Obdirat	“Do you understand?” His voice grew silkier. “[MASK], I want you to flense the flesh from his bones. I leave it to you how to do it.” He locked on her eyes.
<name>Luca</name>	Luca	Udivetelno	“Can you tell me about it?” She hesitated, gathering her thoughts, while she watched him dice tomatoes, garlic, and onions and saute them in a pan of hot olive oil. [MASK], remarkable, he knows Italian cooking, she thought.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Volontov	“I’m sure I cannot speak for the Deputy Director,” said [MASK], swerv- ing away from the washed-out bridge of their conversation. “All you need to focus on is to move the relationship forward. Develop bonds of trust.”
<name>McKenna</name>	McKenna	Egorov	This Nash episode was exactly what he didn’t need. “Could surveillance have been more poorly managed?” [MASK] raged. He was generally given to mild theatrics in front of his subordinates. “It’s obvious this little prick Nash met with a source last night.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Volontov	She tamped down a cold rage as she looked at the warts on [MASK]’s neck. “Very well, Colonel. I am to meet the American again next week. I will remember your guidance concerning intimacy, and I will report progress.
<name>She</name>	She	Dominika	Then they had little more to say; they both were leaden with the lie, with the denial of their passion. His purple cloud never changed, as if he felt no conflict. [MASK] closed her mind to him.
<name>Leonard</name>	Leonard	Golov	The needle had a burnt coppery hue to it, as if it had been held over a flame. [MASK] slid the needle back into its sheath in the clip and firmly pushed the pearl past a detent into the locked position. “What is this?”
<name>He</name>	He	Nate	“I’m glad you were able to find the place,” said [MASK]. “It’s a little out-of-the-way, but a friend said the food was excellent.” He looked at the light on her hair.
<name>Gus</name>	Gus	UNSUB	If we do our homework, [MASK]’s in a Supermax facility without parole, one hundred percent. We make a mistake, and he retires as a seven-figure consultant. You think you can press your legs together a little longer?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Volontov	Her throat closed and she was amazed to feel her legs tremble, knees actually knocking, quite extraordinary, and she resisted leaning against the desk, willed herself to stop. [MASK] continued looking at her chest, a wing of pomaded hair sticking out from the side of his head.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Dominika	“Very well,” she said, rising. “With your permission, may I go?” [MASK] got up and walked in front of the picture window toward the door, the sun highlighting her hair, framing her classic profile.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	DIVA	[MASK] was an agent, we protect agents, we run risks, we run them, the best ones we run against horrendous odds. And sometimes we lose them, despite all the tradecraft and all the precautions. Do you understand me?”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Nate	“No, not right now, I mean are you happy generally, with your life?” said [MASK]. “Yes,” she said. “It’s just that sometimes you seem so serious ... sad, even.
<name>Synesthesia</name>	Synesthesia	Vassily	“And the black cloud. I do not like that.” [MASK] asked a colleague from the Faculty of Psychology about the colors. “I have read about a similar condition,” said the colleague. “Sensing letters as colors. It’s quite interesting.
<name>her</name>	her	Dominika	A part of [MASK] watched the process from afar. She saw how they respected her, valued her training, yet took nothing for granted. She knew they were testing her in little ways. Sometimes they deferred to her, other times they insisted on doing it their way.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Golov	She clipped the Montblanc inside her blouse between the buttons and threw back the last of her wine. The gravity of the moment now past, her eyes wandered around the room and settled on the four-poster bed and then on [MASK]. “Even remotely interested?”
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Dominika	“What we did was against the rules, unprofessional; it was my fault, we risked your security, the operation.” She was silent, looking down at him. It was another second before she spoke. ‘“The operation,’” [MASK] said.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Dominika	They stood shoulder to shoulder at the little cooking element, the gas hissing through the burners, the sauce simmering in the pan. The wooden spoon made a soft sound, almost a musical note, against the thin aluminum as [MASK] pushed the thickening tomatoes around.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Dominika	Whatever it is, she’s upset, vulnerable. A glass of wine, scotch, vodka? Teeth chattering against the glass as she took a sip. “I know you speak Russian,” [MASK] said suddenly in Russian, her voice flat, exhausted.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Benford	“And if I elect to continue working with you, what do you want me to do?” “If you’re in, I would ask that you make a phone call,” said [MASK], “to your uncle.”
<name>Orion</name>	Orion	TrapDoor	They were going north along the river anticipating the route. [MASK] was in play. One Orion—a grandmother when she wasn’t tracking SVR officers— held at the parking lot of Lock 10 on the C&O Canal National Park.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Egorov	The surveillance teams will get the message, especially, if I may suggest, if some time at katorga could be arranged.” [MASK] looked at his Cl chief blankly, noting that he used the czarist name for gulag with wet-lipped relish.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Simyonov	He is not brave enough. Do you really think... ?” [MASK] turned to her as he lit a cigarette. His eyes blazed yellow. “If it doesn’t work, we can log it into your copy book as a failure, then,” he said.
<name>God</name>	God	Nate	It rasped against the mattress ticking in the dark cell, no windows, two cots, and she thought about her mother waiting for her with dinner, and silently called out to her father and then, surprising herself, to [MASK].
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Gable	“Oh, yeah, some of those Russian Red Army girls were hot,” said [MASK], looking up at the ceiling. “Those tunics and boots, they looked—” “Is this your idea of operational coaching?
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Nate	Her grip, her eyes, the way she stood. “Would you like a cup of tea? What time is it?” She checked her watch, which she wore with the face on the bottom of her wrist, a classic tell of a street surveillant, thought [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Vanya	[MASK] put a finger to his lips. He led her limping to the side of the living room. The day of her fathers funeral. He had chosen this time purposely, hadn’t he? They always did.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Langley	Hall file was right after all, usually is. [MASK] would cable. Time for a CONUS tour, sit a spell, let’s talk about your future. His father would write, Welcome home, son, all is forgiven. A pitch-black mine shaft, steep and airless.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Dominika	“I congratulate you on your achievement and on your entrance to the Service.” “The training was challenging, but everything I could have hoped for,” said [MASK]. “I am ready to start work.” It was true.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Panimat	“Look, I’m not telling you not to save her, but the name is more important than anything, than anyone. [MASK]? Understand? I’m waiting for results, and keep your mouth closed. Out.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Marta	His water-bug instincts told him there was something lurking under the surface, perhaps something very important. He lowered his pistol. [MASK] turned the knob on his office door and walked out. Colleagues were gathered in the hallway; they had heard the shouting.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Dominika	You mean with a man, she thought bitterly. He saw her eyes and put up his hand. “I don’t mean what you’re thinking. I need you as an operupolnomochenny, an operations officer.” “That’s what I want to be,” said [MASK].
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Boucher	“Anatoly,” said [MASK] with mock warmth, “I have been waiting in this stupid little garden for nearly an hour.” She stabbed at a little gold lighter several times before she could light her cigarette.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Dominika	[MASK] put her hand behind his head and pressed their lips together more tightly (No. 13, “Unambiguously signal sexual willingness") and took a trembling breath (No. 4, “Build passionate response by evincing passion").
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	MARBLE	Scan the shadows. No street sweeper, no lolling bum. A mistake, despite all the hours of his SDR, of provocative maneuvers, of waiting and watching in the snow and cold, a single mistake would have one inescapable result—the death of [MASK].
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Nasarenko	“An attack of shingles can be debilitating. I am hoping our source will recover soon.” “Yes, of course,” said [MASK], “we will continue our analysis of the existing information. There’s more than enough data to keep us busy for some time.”
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Dominika	You’ll remember that the ultimate goal is to elicit information that may lead to the identification of a traitor. It is urgent, paramount, that you do.” “Yes,” said [MASK], “I understand the ultimate goal.
<name>men</name>	men	Americans	“He was funny and courteous and pleasant. I never knew [MASK] were like that.” My God, I said courteous? She thought she sounded idiotic. He was still looking at her, glowing purple, but with calmness.
<name>Viktor</name>	Viktor	Nate	“Dobryj vecher, dyadya,” said [MASK]. He had begun using the familiar “uncle,” part tradecraft to show respect, part a display of real affection. He checked his watch. “It’s been twelve hours. The street feels loose.”
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Dominika	The nerve pain was different from the tendon pain, which was different from the pain of a cable tie cinched tight around her head, across her open mouth. [MASK] found that the anticipation of pain, waiting for what was next, was worse than the agonies they could generate.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nate	[MASK] hadn’t seen a car in several minutes, and he thought he had slipped outside their search perimeter. It had started snowing again. Up ahead a vehicle screeched to a stop, then reversed and turned into the alley, its headlights catching the snow.
<name>She</name>	She	Dominika	He could see it in their faces. Contemplating his arrest and certain demise was made easier knowing that he had set in motion his legacy. He noted with satisfaction that [MASK] was not mentioned during any of the questioning, nor was there any insinuation that she was under suspicion.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	MARBLE	[MASK] was short and stocky, with deep brown eyes separated by a fleshy nose. He had bushy white eyebrows, which matched his full head of wavy white hair, giving him the appearance of an elegant boulevardier. They were supposed to use aliases, but that was ridiculous.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Forsyth	Why don’t we tell him she’s not available?” “No,” said [MASK]. “Tell him she refuses.” “No. Get her primed, tell her to smile. Those blue eyes will do the rest.
<name>John</name>	John	Dominika	He put the frame back down on the table. “Then she became ill. Misdiagnosed for months.” They walked into the tiny kitchen. “Don’t get sick at a Russian Embassy overseas.” He smiled. [MASK] noticed his head was bowed.
<name>John</name>	John	Vanya	“Your mother would not lose it, even after your father’s death. It would be a great comfort to her.” [MASK] let go of her hand, straightened, and walked out of the room. Astonished, she watched him close the door behind him.
<name>she</name>	she	Dominika	In the last millisecond, [MASK] decided. “There’s nothing to report at this time,” she said, heart pounding. She had stepped across the line separating being guilty of an infraction to committing treason against the State.
<name>Sasha</name>	Sasha	Uncle	she asked, controlling the quaver in her voice. “[MASK], I thought I would be entering the Service as an officer, to be assigned to a department, to begin practicing intelligence work. This is training for prostitutki, not staff officers.”
<name>Vladimir</name>	Vladimir	Dominika	[MASK] observed with interest the orange haze of deceit and careerism around his bullet head. Orange, different from the yellow-tinted walruses back home. But he had been around for many years, during the really difficult times in the KGB, and was a protean survivor.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Vanya	[MASK] watched her walk across the carpet—did she limp a little?—and stop briefly at the door to turn and look back at him. A shiver ran over his scalp as he saw the blue eyes, intense and unblinking, ripsaws and scalpels, fix on his face for three alarming seconds.
<name>Mr. Johnson</name>	Mr. Johnson	Benford	A torn and faded couch along the back wall was completely covered by stacks of files, some of which had fallen to the floor, where they lay fanned out like spilled poker chips. At the other end of the room, [MASK]’s desk was a riot of overflowing in-boxes, stacked three high.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Dominika	Enormous Chinese lamps cast warm light in pools throughout the room, and in one corner hung an abstract reclining nude, fingers and eyes and toes pointing in all directions, a Picasso, [MASK] guessed. That will be me in fifteen minutes, she thought wryly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	MARBLE	“Yes and no. Told me to go to hell, that she was doing it to spring [MASK], for no other reason. Said she’s going back to think about working with us. In the meantime, she intends to raise hell in the Center.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Golov	Her value elevated her above the status of agent—she was a supermole, a potential agent of influence, a Manchurian candidate. [MASK] had begun directing, assisting, coaching her, preparing her further for important career advancement. It was not new.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Mikhail	“It just seems that way,” she would reply, never explaining that the bloom of passion-purple around the man flared when the woman came around the corner. [MASK] laughed and looked at her in amazement when it turned out to be right.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Missy	“Your boss at Justice will impale you on a spit, and my lawyer will roast you over an open flame.” [MASK] hurriedly gathered her papers, but an FBI agent gently said, “I’m going to have to take these papers, miss, sorry.”
<name>the character</name> (There is no specific name given in the passage, so the answer is a generic placeholder for any possible character that could fit in the context.)	the character (There is no specific name given in the passage, so the answer is a generic placeholder for any possible character that could fit in the context.)	Dominika	“I have recommended to the colonel that you would be uniquely suited to assist in the operation, especially since you have completed your training at the Academy with an excellent record. I wanted the two of you to meet.” What is this nonsense? thought [MASK].
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Dominika	“I do not ask you to help me for nothing in return,” he said. “I believe I can intervene in the matter of this apartment.” [MASK] pulled back. “Your mother would not lose it, even after your father’s death.
<name>The speaker</name>	The speaker	Egorov	The source of the information, a sensitive source that I cannot describe further for obvious reasons, is wrestling with health matters and must suspend work for a short time.” [MASK] let the sentence hang in the air. “Nothing so serious as to curtail the information, I hope?”
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Dominika	[MASK] resisted the impulse to tuck in his collar and straighten his tie. She knew his birth date, what kind of aspirin was in the cabinet above his bathroom sink, the color of the bedspread on his lonely bed. Well, she thought, he certainly looked like a commercial attache.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Dominika	Two days later, [MASK] sat in the formal parlor of their apartment, her right foot extended in the cast, her eyes dry, her elegant neck and head held high. Her mother sat beside her, in black, quiet and calm.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Dominika	“The van going to the airport is normal. The first thing they’d do—all last night— is copy the damn thing and prepare the pouch. Now they’re bringing the original back in the bag on the noon flight. [MASK] and two escorts.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Nate	Return medallions to sauce to warm. 15 Past midnight now, the Helsinki snow had given way to the rains of emergent spring, which spattered on the pavement, dripped off the bare limbs of the trees, and rattled against the windows. [MASK] tossed in his bed.
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Dominika	A Russian patriot.” Continue speaking of my father and I shall lean forward and bite your lower lip off, she thought. Instead, [MASK] gave him a smile that only recently she had come to recognize had an effect on people.
<name>Tyrell</name>	Tyrell	Simyonov	“He would have recruited his own daughter for me,” she raved. [MASK] did not turn to look at her but muttered, “He will do so at any rate.” He pointed a remote and the sound came from the live monitor.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Vanya	“What am I to do with you, niece?” said [MASK] finally, getting up from his desk and walking to stand in front of the picture window. “Your record is strong, you should not jeopardize the career ahead of you.
<name>Aldrich Ames</name>	Aldrich Ames	MARBLE	Problems over the years solved, big and small, and the deposits to the retirement account, the yellow flimsies bookmarking each six-month chapter of the odyssey. The file captured a chronology of CIA Russia Division chiefs, some prodigious, some less so, who claimed [MASK]’s successes as their own.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Dominika	They both knew there could have been no other way with these two mechanics. He studied [MASK] intently in the nearly dark room, her chest rising and falling, a little blood on her arm. “I will be a little bitchy from now on,” she said.
<name>Blofeld</name>	Blofeld	Zyuganov	He suppressed insane, cackling laughter. He was discussing finding the spy, flushing him out, exposing him, catching him. [MASK] swiveled in his chair, his feet not touching the carpet. “And if your niece does not succeed in a reasonable amount of time?
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Dominika	[MASK] contemptuously tore both her arms free of their grasp, told them, “Yob tuvoyu mat’,” straightened her coat, and stepped forward. With that slight hitch, she began walking into the fog, head Up, ballet calves flexing, shoulders back.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Nate	She stiffened, then relaxed and finally put her hands on his chest and gently pushed him back. “We don’t have time—not remotely enough time—to tell you I’m sorry about what I said to you,” said [MASK].
<name>his</name>	his	Korchnois	Pain ran through [MASK] body; he was losing feeling in his arms where the men were gripping him tightly. It doesn’t matter, he thought, preparing himself for the next chapter. He knew what was coming. The ride in the windowless van was long.
<name>Renard</name>	Renard	Matorins	The knife whistled as he swung it in a backhand cutting blow. [MASK] body glistened from his exertions. He sat down on a Louis XIV chair, his sweat staining the powder-blue brocade. He picked up a large ceramic ashtray embossed with the King George crest and turned it over.
<name>them</name>	them	Nate	They sat in swaybacked American Gothic farmhouses along lonely country roads and drank vodka and convinced gibbering role players to commit treason. Through the pines, the slate-black river was furrowed by the talons of duskfeeding ospreys. What instinct enabled [MASK] to excel in practical exercises?
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	ARCHIE	Forget coats, forget hats, [MASK] was looking at the way people walked, their gaits, the sets of their shoulders, the shapes of their ears and noses. Things surveillants cannot change. And shoes. They never change shoes.
<name>Nadya</name>	Nadya	Dominika	Sounds of feet on the linoleum and continued bellowing and now mewling, whimpering, receded down the hallway. Not even her daddy in the Duma could save her, she thought. [MASK] put her hand up in front of her face in the nearly dark office.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Korchnoi	The cafeteria walls closed in on him, the voices in the room became a dull roar. He made himself take a spoonful of the soup. “Well, that’s certainly good news for you. We take all the breaks we can.” [MASK] lowered his voice.
