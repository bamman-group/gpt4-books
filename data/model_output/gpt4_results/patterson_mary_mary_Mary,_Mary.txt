<name>He</name>	He	Page	There was no way I could do a proper job in the middle of all this chaos and confusion. “Oh, and one other thing you should tell who-ever’s in charge,” I said. [MASK] turned back. “Yeah?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Griner	[MASK] worked in the older part of the complex, a 1930s-era building that he had a certain affection for, under normal circumstances, anyway. The main doors were large bronze affairs, flanked with imposing twin eagle sculptures.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alex	She was the one who decided to leave, who said she was unfit to be [MASK]’s mom. She told me that. She used the word—unfit. And she was the one who kept changing her mind. Nothing had ever changed for me.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Jeanne	We kissed, and it was longer and more satisfying than the first time. She smelled terrific, felt even better; and her brown eyes were beautiful up close like this. [MASK] took my hand, and she started to pull me back into her apartment.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Jeanne	I hated to leave the crime scene. There was a lot of work to be done. If [MASK] weren’t wearing her stress so plainly, maybe I would have said no. “Give me five minutes to finish up here,” I told her.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sugar	He’s already his own person.” He patted me on the top of my head. “The point is right here on your skull, [MASK]. Now you listen to me.” He waited until I sat up and gave him my full attention.
<name>Everyone</name>	Everyone	LAPD	But you take every name-above-the-title actress in this town, even just sticking to the ones with families, and you’ve got a long list on your hands. “Plus, [MASK]’s going to be a little trigger shy about the panic factor.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Page	[MASK] asked. “Controlled, yet out of control.” I looked at him, and my mouth twisted into something resembling a smile. The insight surprised me a little. “Yes. Exactly.” The bodies had been arranged, just so, inside the car.
<name>Whiskers</name>	Whiskers	Rosie	Our cat, [MASK], was in the kitchen, and looked a bit heavier if I wasn’t mistaken. She rubbed hard up against my legs, as if to say, I’m mad you left, but I’m glad you’re back.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Alex	Most of all, I realized, I hadn’t even gotten to say good-bye to my son, and now he was gone again. “What about [MASK]? How was he?” “He was confused, and seemed sad, the poor little boy.
<name>She</name>	She	Jamilla	In the beginning of our relationship, I had expected something like this, but not now. Maybe I’d just gotten complacent. Or too trusting. That was a recurring problem I had. [MASK] winced a little, thinking about her answer.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Christine	[MASK] turned from us and started to walk away very quickly, without saying a word. When she reached the courtroom doors, her shoulders hunched forward. Suddenly, she put a hand to her mouth. I couldn’t tell for sure, but I thought that she began to sob.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Damon	When I picked up the phone, though, I was surprised to hear [MASK]’s voice already on the line. “Yeah, I missed you, too. I was thinking about you. I swear I was, all the time.” Then an adolescent girl’s laughter.
<name>He</name>	He	Blaisdale	The group went to the lake that day. Unfortunately, one of the patients had a meltdown of some sort.” Of some sort? I wondered if he knew the exact details, even now. [MASK] seemed like a hands-off administrator if I’d ever seen one.
<name>management</name>	management	LAPD	I think he knew that, so it caught me off guard when he started the meeting the way he did. “I just want to say a few things before we get going,” he began. “As you all know by now, we’re quasi on our own where [MASK] is concerned.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Alex	His only big successes had been with her, and it looked like she was checking out. She was divorcing him, [MASK]. They hadn’t yet filed, but a friend of hers knew it was coming.” “What did you say to me once?
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	It was certainly possible she had given birth a year ago, but somehow, I doubted it very much. I checked the ages to be sure about what she’d said. “Eight, five, eleven months?” [MASK] nodded. “That’s right.”
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Kayla	But I was already through the doorway. As I headed to the kitchen, there was only one thing on my mind, though. How could I get [MASK] alone at the party? And where was I going to take her on our first date?
<name>She</name>	She	Alicia	“Highway’s that way,” he said. The other two moved off to the side, too. [MASK] felt as if she might faint from relief. She gave the men a watery smile. “Thank you. I’m so sorry,” she said again.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Brendan	[MASK] pointed to a little boy about his own age wearing Mickey Mouse ears with Matthew embroidered across the brim. “Can we get those?” he asked hopefully. “Can we please, please, please?” “No, I’m sorry, sweetie.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jamilla	I thought about calling [MASK], but decided against it, and right then I knew that it was completely over between us. A sad thought, but a true one, and I was sure that we both knew it. Whose fault was it? I didn’t know.
<name>Strike</name>	Strike	Page	“Anything yet?” I spread my arms to indicate the breadth of information on the desk. “She doesn’t fit in.” “Which was probably true for about half the female serial killers in history at the time of their activity,” said [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Awkward	“For FBI.” “You’re okay for a cop. For LAPD.” Then she reached across the table and put her hand on mine. But she quickly took her hand away. “[MASK],” she said, and smiled again.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	I could only hypothesize at this point, but it seemed to me that [MASK] was on a crash course toward a fuller realization, and wreaking havoc along the way. Now that she was in custody again, the only person she could harm was herself.
<name>him</name>	him	Alex	She told me that. She used the word—unfit. And she was the one who kept changing her mind. Nothing had ever changed for me. I wanted [MASK] from the moment I set eyes on him, and I wanted him even more now.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Page	I asked [MASK]. “Does she fit the MO?” “Basically, yeah. She fits right into the puzzle. Married with one son, good-looking woman, high profile in the city. She was a ten-o’clock anchor for a local affiliate.
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Mary	“No!” [MASK] took a deep breath and counted to five. She tried to get control of herself, tried so hard. “Look at your brother. He likes it. It’s so yummy.”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Alex	“You might not like it a whole lot.” “Listen, you find something for me :o like about all this and I’ll double your fee.” “Well, one of your strongest arguments is going to be [MASK]’s relationship to his siblings.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	And he’d already done me more than one favor in my short tenure. Of course, I had done him a few good turns, too. “[MASK], just do a quick in-and-out on this one. I’d really appreciate it.
<name>He</name>	He	Truscott	But why? I was seeing red as I yanked open the car door on his side. My mouth was open to start to yell, but nothing came out, not a word. [MASK] wasn’t here to cause me any trouble—at least not now.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ashley	Sweetie?” Her eyes quickly scanned the small, crowded playground. Several blonde mop tops on swings or running around, but no [MASK]. The whole place was enclosed with a wrought-iron fence. How far could she have gotten? She headed toward the gate.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Billie	I’m six-three, not exactly chiseled, but not too shabby, and he makes me look slight. “[MASK] and I are good together, no question about it,” he went on, rambling but making sense in his way.
<name>Siri</name>	Siri	Vermont	It lasted over the course of about a month and a half. I slowed down and perused the visitors’ names. Most were unfamiliar to me. One of them, I recognized. MY CELL PHONE and [MASK] seemed to hate each other.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Galletta	In the e-mails. Kids are a part of this puzzle, a piece. To be honest, I’ve never come across anything even remotely like it.” [MASK] bit her lip and looked at the floor. I waited to see what she would say next.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Tracey	legs set apart, looking him up and down with those bedroom eyes of hers, hungry eyes, just as he remembered. Finally, [MASK] pulled up her top and said, “Well?” So he took her to bed, where she complimented his new lean body again.
<name>him</name>	him	Lebleau	Day before the first message.” I had to concentrate just to follow [MASK]. Did everybody out here have ADD? “What about the second e-mail?” I asked him. “Transmission didn’t originate in the same place as the first one.
<name>Oh</name>	Oh	Lord	“May I come in and ask you a few questions? It’s important.” Her tired face sagged. “It’s about the cai; isn’t it? [MASK], I wish I could just paint that thing or trade it in or something.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Zoey	“We’ll do this later,” I said softly. “Another time. I’ve got your statement on file. I don’t need much more anyway.” He looked at me appreciatively, the side of his face pressed against [MASK]’s head.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bill	The hotel corridors would offer no cover, and my priority was to interview her at home later, as myself. That meant a limited surveillance for [MASK] at the hotel. My best opportunity came during the lunch hour, when the staff cafeteria was filled to capacity.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alex	I put the phone back to my ear. “What was the basis for the claim?” I asked. Not that I didn’t already know, or at least suspect. “Concern for [MASK]’s safety.
<name>Mickey</name>	Mickey	Goofy	An hour later I was dressed and ready to go be a tourist. “Who wants to have breakfast with [MASK]?” I called out. The hotel offered “character breakfasts,” and it seemed like a good way to channel our energies right back into vacation mode.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Maureen	A secretary at the field office, [MASK], poked her head in. “You want anything from In-n-Out Burger?” I looked up and realized it was dark already, and that, actually, I was starving.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alicia	The idea that she could be murdered before she had her morning coffee came over [MASK] with an ugly reckoning. “Please, I just... please. D-don’t h-hurt me,” she stammered. She could hear the helplessness in her own voice.
<name>Judge</name>	Judge	Ben	“I’ve considered all the testimony and the evidence put before me, and I’ve reached my decision. Based on everything I’ve heard, it all seems very clear.” [MASK] looked reflexively at me, but I wasn’t sure what the look meant.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Ben	How many times had I seen capable adult witnesses eviscerated in a courtroom? Too many to even consider putting my kids up there. “No, no, no,” [MASK] assured me. “Definitely not. But it would have a positive impact if they could be present for the hearing.
<name>Brad</name>	Brad	Truscott	“Don’t you dare photograph my kids!” I said. “Now you and your girlfriend get out of here. Please, go.” [MASK] raised his hands over his head, smiled cockily, and then backed away.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Mary	I sipped my coffee and took a polite bite of scone. “I’d like to go back to the day of the murders now. What did [MASK] have to say when she was caught, Sheriff?” “This is more piecework than anything, just my memories.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ashley	That just wouldn’t do. She carefully tore it out. Maybe it was silly, but she thought this book as a sacred place, not somewhere you wanted to put a shopping list. She suddenly realized [MASK] was gone! Oh my God, where is she?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Griner	The rest of the floor was a wide expanse of desks and cubicles. From time to time, someone would pop his or her head over a cubicle wall, steal a quick glance our way, and duck back down. Prairie-dogging, [MASK] called it, chuckling to himself.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Page	Everyone else is on break.” For the first time that morning, [MASK] paused before he responded. This was an all-business side of me he hadn’t seen. Not that I’m big on throwing my weight around, but right now I had to use it.
<name>Hades</name>	Hades	Hades	Hot, 1 hope. Hot as [MASK]—isn't that an expression? Do you miss your children terribly? Have some regrets? I'll bet you do. I would if I were you. But I'm no Big Shot, just one of the little people.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Mary	Still, if she was in fact moving toward the truth, I hated to think what might happen to her when she got there. IT WAS HARD TO TEAR MYSELF AWAY from [MASK]’s journals—her words, her ideas, and her anger.
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	Now she looked up, her eyes searching mine. “Could I have a cup of coffee? Would it be too much trouble?” The coffee arrived, and [MASK] held the paper cup with her fingertips and sipped at it with an unexpected kind of delicacy.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Claude	“Don’t know,” said [MASK], “but I’m inclined to doubt it. He was a bum.” “Well, I need to find him,” I muttered, more to myself than to either of them.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Alex	She reached out to put a cool hand on my cheek. It felt familiar and so comforting. What would I do without this ornery old woman? I couldn’t help thinking. What will I do? “They said you’re going to be fine, [MASK].
<name>Detective</name>	Detective	Beneke	Who the hell could do something like this? The poor woman was practically erased from the neck up. Her face was a tangle of cut flesh. The pool’s water was tinted bright pink all around the body. [MASK] walked over to get a closer look.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Alicia	“This your car?” Fear and confusion locked [MASK] into subservience, which she hated. All she could think to do was answer his question. “It’s my parents’.” The guy in blue rubbed his chin whiskers as if considering her answer.
<name>Callie</name>	Callie	Alex	“[MASK], I don’t know what to say. I’m stunned. I haven’t seen a ruling from the bench in five years. I’m so sorry.” I barely heard him, and I was hardly conscious of my family swarming around me.
<name>Receptionist</name>	Receptionist	Beadsie	She waved to a woman in a goldfish-bowl office at the back. Then she left, without another word—to me, or to [MASK]. The pages of the visitor’s log were divided into columns.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Madeline	Not even now, after all these years.” “Sometimes there is no explanation,” I said. “Anyway, she didn’t put up any resistance whatsoever. We took her in quietly.” “It was a huge story, though,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	She had on a black wrap cashmere sweater, black slacks, and kitten-heel sling-backs, and she was kind of dazzling again. In her own way. “I’m sorry, [MASK],” she said as she walked up to me at the bar.
<name>She</name>	She	Nana	I asked, unable to completely drop the subject. I was more curious about it than I was reluctant to show how out of the loop I had become with my older son. “He didn’t tell me; it just sort of presented itself,” [MASK] said.
<name>Day</name>	Day	Damon	[MASK]’s whisper from behind caught me off guard. “That you?” “What’s up, Day?” I sat down on the edge of his bed and rubbed his back. I’d been doing it since he was an infant, and wouldn’t stop until he made me.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alex	Just let it be, [MASK]. “Thanks for the flowers,” she whispered against my eat “All of the flowers. They’re absolutely beautiful. I know, I know, not as beautiful as me.” I laughed out loud.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	I wondered if her therapy sessions felt like this to her patients. “I just don’t see it. It’s hard to know what might have happened to [MASK] once she left here, but as for the woman that I knew?”
<name>Ashlyn</name>	Ashlyn	Alex	“I just want to talk about what’s best for [MASK]. Nothing else matters.” His nod and the pursing of his lips told me that was the right answer—or was the look merely for the judge’s benefit? “Yes, absolutely,” he said.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Marti	Or then cutting your pretty face to ribbons and shreds. Tell you what, [MASK], that was the best part of all. I'm starting to really like defacement. Now, let me ask one final question—do you know why you had to die?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Christine	When [MASK] came in, she looked very fresh and put together. I’m not sure what I expected, maybe some outward indication that this was as hard for her as it was for me. Her hair looked longer, pulled back in a French braid.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Sampson	So yeah, he’ll settle for you.” [MASK] laughed loudly, one of my favorite sounds. “I miss you, too,” he said. “And believe it or not, I have an answer.
<name>McDonald's</name>	McDonald's	Wendy	A wastebasket in the corner overflowed with empty cups and greasy restaurant takeout bags. [MASK]’s seemed to be winning the battle of the burgers at this precinct. Two detectives in shirtsleeves sat at a large wooden table, both of them bent over separate piles of paperwork.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Page	Apparently after she gave him a verbal promise, which seems to mean next to nothing out here. The whole thing fell apart, and he lost a half million in development.” I could hear the adrenaline in [MASK]’s voice. He was like a greyhound at the gate.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Perkins	I wanted to see that journal. Her conversations with the people around her seemed to be little more than polite hellos and good-byes. The perfect employee. I decided to pull myself out at that point, and went back to [MASK]’s office in the basement.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Page	My watch read 3:05. He caught up with me under a streetlight. “Over this way,” he said. “How’d you hear about it?” I asked him. [MASK] was the one who had called me in my hotel room.
<name>Since</name>	Since	Alex	Prosecution, of course. I met him on one of my cases. [MASK], I’ve only seen him twice. Socially, that is.” I stopped myself from asking more questions, even though I wanted to. I didn’t have a right, did I?
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Bell	But then, he was a watcher, a plotter. There was probably a lot that [MASK] knew. “So what now?” I asked. “What do you think? You’re supposed to be the expert, right? So, what happens now?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Mary	She knew exactly what she was doing. “No! [MASK]!” With a rush of adrenaline, fighting an equal surge of resistance from her, I managed to lift her gun hand toward the ceiling. Then I smashed it back down, very hard, against the floor.
<name>She</name>	She	Mary	She was a maid at the hotel. College kid. We think [MASK] got in the room with her passkey.” “One other thing,” I said. “If anyone asks, you haven’t heard from me and you don’t know where I am.”
<name>Jules</name>	Jules	Mary	“All right, all right,” [MASK] said. Her voice was tense, and she was a little embarrassed. She winked to the attendant. “Kids,” she said conspiratorially, then jogged across the platform to catch up with her crew, her lovies.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	“Tell me where my kids are! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! This instant!” “[MASK]—” I leaned over and took her by the shoulders, as gently as I could under the circumstances. “Tell me!”
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Antonia	That was fine with him—safer, smarter. A minute or so later, he joined in with fans and other looky-loos making the pilgrimage to the shrine where poor [MASK] had checked out of the rat race this morning.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Page	[MASK] paused on the line. “I’m not going to lie if someone asks me, but I won’t volunteer anything. Anyway, I’m on my way out of the office.” “Good enough. By the way, you’re doing a terrific job.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Jannie	just watching them. Nothing ever healed me the way these two did. My babies, no matter how old you are. [MASK] slept at the edge of her bed with the comforter in a wad off to the side. I went over and covered her up.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Day	I forced myself to hang up, quietly. Yeah, I missed you, too f Who was this girl? And since when was [MASK] keeping secrets? I had fooled myself into thinking that if a girlfriend came along, he’d want to tell me about it.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nana	I didn’t want to disturb the poor girl, but she came awake on her own. It had always been that way with [MASK]. When I was little, all I had to do was stand next to her bed if I was sick or had a nightmare.
<name>John</name>	John	Mary	“The way everybody knows everybody around here,” she said. “This is a community of neighbors. We all depend on one another.” “What can you tell me about [MASK] before all this happened?” I asked both of them.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Mommy	“Can we please, please, please?” “No, I’m sorry, sweetie. [MASK] doesn’t have enough money for that. Not this trip. Next time for sure.” She wondered suddenly why she hadn’t thought to pack sandwiches.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Christine	The coffee. Your house looks great, too.” The chitchattiness was striking in its banality, and almost as uncomfortable as a real conversation might have been right now. I vowed not to ask [MASK] about the weather, but this was weird for both of us.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Jannie	“What did I miss?” “What is it?” [MASK] asked, demanded actually. “I want to know what’s going on. Was it about the Spy Museum? You two mocking me? I will not be mocked.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maria	Not just to lose a wife, but to lose her in this way. A while back, I’d been pretty much where he was right now. If his experience was anything like mine with [MASK], there was no comfort to be had anywhere, much less from a stranger, a policeman.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Brendan	“Just [MASK]?” “Yes. Please read this to your brother and sis-ter^ because you’re the big boy in the family.” I took it down verbatim, writing fast to keep up with her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Seeya	And talented— which is what’s holding me back in this town.” “Hey, man—I hear you, I feel ya,” he yelled. “[MASK], A-list! Ya hack!” “I’m just a storyteller!”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Mary	“Okay.” “Good, now why don’t you go and try the jungle gym?” [MASK] settled down on another bench away from the gathering storm of disapproving stares. A young mother reading the L.A. Times smiled over at her. “Hello.”
<name>Rodriguez</name>	Rodriguez	Campbell	“Just what we need, some Carmelita who doesn’t even speak English, bawling her eyes out and acting muy loco.” [MASK] responded the way he always did to the younger officer’s tiresome, racist cynicism.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Perkins	[MASK] shook his head. “Just the cleaning records.” He looked over his papers again. “She definitely keeps up with her quotas, which she wouldn’t be able to do if she was ducking out a lot. And her comment cards are fine.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alex	“I haven’t seen a naturally occurring thing since we arrived here, [MASK]. Have you?” She pursed her lips and pulled down the corners of her mouth, but then she couldn’t help laughing, putting herself in stitches.
<name>She</name>	She	Alicia	“W-what?” she said, unable to keep her voice from quivering. “I said, ‘you lost?’ ” he asked. “That’s all, lady—you lost? You look—lost.” [MASK] choked back a sob.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Kayla	[MASK] arrived less than five minutes after I did, and I liked that. She was on time, no game-playing. She had on a black wrap cashmere sweater, black slacks, and kitten-heel sling-backs, and she was kind of dazzling again.
<name>John</name>	John	Ben	The judge went for it. I’m sorry to have to tell you that.” I squeezed the phone tight in my hand. It was hard to respond, or even take in what [MASK] was telling me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Arnold	Good-bye, [MASK]. You're gone, and know what else? You're already forgotten. THE STORYTELLER HAD TO STOP the stream of murders now. He knew that; it was part of the plan, and the plan was a good one.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	“Don’t worry about it.” But that sounded to me like code for worry about it. “Sure, go,” I said. “Talk to you tomorrow?” she asked. “Sorry. I have to run. Tomorrow, [MASK]?”
