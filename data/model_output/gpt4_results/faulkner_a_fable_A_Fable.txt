<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Byron	Oh yes, I knew: the English poet [MASK]’s dream or wish or cry that all living women had but one single mouth for his kiss: the supreme golden youth who encompassed all flesh by putting, still virgin to it, all flesh away.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Marthe	‘Get out of town while you can. Come on now. Get started.’ ‘We belong here too,’ [MASK] said. For a second he glared down at them, he and the horse in high sharp fading silhouette against the sky itself filled with anguish and fury.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bridesman	[MASK] took it. ‘Thanks,’ he said. He said: ‘I dont know.’ He said harsh and strong: ‘I dont want to know. All I know is, we have a job tomorrow and you’re on it.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Caesar	There are ways to do things, and ways not to do them.’ ‘Render under [MASK]?’ the runner said. ‘I cannot discuss this subject while I bear this,' the padre said, his hand flicking for an instant toward the crown on his cuff.
<name>Mistral</name>	Mistral	Harry	‘Mist what?’ the runner said. ‘[MASK],’ the youth said. ‘That’s how he pronounced it.’ ‘Oh,’ the runner said, with a sort of shame. ‘Of course.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Picklock	‘Take it back then,’ [MASK] said: and then no more of that either; the hands snatching at the bottles almost before the corks were out, so that when the sergeant returned about an hour later, his outrage—not rage: outrage—knew no bounds.
<name>Anselmo</name>	Anselmo	Zsettlani	‘What?’ the sister said suddenly and harshly, then to the man with the feather in the same mountain tongue: “You are [MASK]?’ ‘What?’ the man with the feather said in French harshly and loudly. ‘I speak French.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Sister	Americans.’ ‘Should American soldiers be more terrible than other soldiers?’ the woman said. ‘Because they are fresher at it? Is that it?’ ‘No, [MASK],’ the other woman said. ‘That’s wrong.
<name>MacArthur</name>	MacArthur	jerry	‘It was just one regiment. Fact is, they’re putting one of the biggest shoots yet in [MASK]’s support and communications along the whole front right this minute. Been at it ever since dawn---’ ‘But one regiment quit,’ the runner said.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Marya	Tou look so exactly like what you are.’ ‘[MASK],’ the other older one said. ‘Dont be ashamed,’ the first one said. ‘You cant help it. You should be pleased, because so many dont.’
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Buchwald	‘Frame it and hang it on the wall,’ the Iowan said. ‘What did you think I was going to do with it?’ ‘Are you sure you’re going to want this one marked on it?’ [MASK] said. ‘What?’
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Buchwald	the Negro panted. ‘Slipped my crap,’ [MASK] said. ‘You didn’t hold him.’ 'Son of a bitch yourself!’ the Negro panted. ‘Me stand there holding him for that bullet to come on through hunting me next?’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marthe	Cafe,’ fumbling the three mugs down until [MASK] took them and distributed them, feeling in her turn the man’s hard hand gripping her hand and the mug both while he guided the spout of the coffee pot into the mug; he even seemed to anticipate the jerk, crying ‘Watch it!’
<name>Anse</name>	Anse	Picklock	‘Sure,’ [MASK] said. ‘Wait in that carriage yonder until they come for that box. I dont know what they’ll do to you then, but I do know what they’ll do if you run because that will be desertion.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bridesman	‘We shant need to go to the mess. I’ve a bottle in the hut.’ Then [MASK] overtook him. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘It will only take a moment,’ he said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Marthe	‘That’s it: his fiancee. That’s the word. Eat your soup.’ ‘They were to be married,’ [MASK] said. ‘She was a Marseille whore.’ ‘I beg pardon?’ the Englishman said.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Monaghan	It was going to rain probably, but then it always was anyway; that is, it always did on days-off from patrols, he didn’t know why yet, he was too new. ‘You will though,’ [MASK] told him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bridesman	‘It’s like the cracked record again isn’t it?’ he said. Then [MASK] released his leg of the sidcott though he didn’t move yet. ‘Then you’ll come along to the hut.’ ‘Of course,’ he said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Polchek	‘He’s not even drinking. What’s the matter, [MASK]? Afraid yours wont produce anything but nettles and you wont make it to the latrine in time and we’ll have to sleep in them?’ The man addressed was on the corporal’s immediate right.
<name>Anselmo</name>	Anselmo	Gragnon	‘Beware,’ the priest said. ‘Then dont tell me this,’ the corporal said. ‘Tell him. If I can save [MASK]’s life only by not doing something you tell me I already cant and never could do anyway.
<name>Faulkner</name>	Faulkner	Marya	Moving, unwearyable and durable and persevering, growing smaller and smaller with distance until at last he had lost all semblance of advancement whatever and appeared as though fixed against a panorama in furious progressless unrest, not lonely: just solitary, invincibly single. Then he was gone. “Yes,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Morache	another said. ‘Buy some liquor? With what? You couldn’t get one franc out of the whole lot of us with a suction pump.' ‘[MASK] can sell his watch,’ a fourth said. ‘But will he?’ a fifth said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bridesman	Then [MASK] was just off his wing-tip again, the two of them going full out now in the pocking cloud of black archie like two sparrows through a swirl of dead leaves; and then he saw the balloons and noticed or remembered or perhaps simply saw the sun.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Picklock	‘Sure,’ [MASK] said in a calm and furious voice, even lowering it a little: ‘Stick around here until somebody comes and lifts that box, let alone opens it. I hear they always give you a drink before you climb the steps.’
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bridesman	I’m trying to kill the son of a bitch. That's why I came two thousand miles over here: to kill them all so I can get to hell back home!’ ‘[MASK],’ he said again but again the major said "Shun there!
<name>Dilsey</name>	Dilsey	Marthe	She extended the basket toward the woman with the spoon. ‘Here,’ she said. ‘Hand me the basket,’ the woman said. A man in the squatting circle took the basket from [MASK] and passed it to her.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Buchwald	‘Oh, coy,’ [MASK] said. ‘Dont let that worry you. The smoke cant help it, coy is a part of what you might say one of his habits or customs or pastimes. The other one dont even know what coy means yet.’
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Gwan	the sergeant said, swapping the valise to the other hand and jerking himself free this time. ‘[MASK]! Beat it:’ taking her by the shoulders, the valise pressed against her back, and turning her and propelling her across the platform toward the quiet group which had been watching too.
<name>Corsican</name>	Corsican	Basque	‘Hold it,’ the Breton said. The man opposite him was short and very dark, his jaw wrenched by an old healed wound. He was saying something rapidly in an almost unintelligible Mediterranean dialect—Midi or perhaps [MASK]. They looked at one another.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Jean	He picked up his filled glass. ‘Come on,’ he said to the corporal. ‘No heel taps. If my belly dont like wine tonight, as [MASK] says that sergeant-major’s pistol will pump it all out tomorrow morning.’
<name>Templeton</name>	Templeton	Marthe	“Yes,’ [MASK] said. Then he was gone. He slacked the horse; its iron feet clashed and sparked on the cobbles; the hot reek sucked after it, pungent for a fading instant, then even the galloping had faded into the sound of the city.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Tes	You even know already in advance the request I’ll finally demand of you, since we both know now that this—’ without uncrossing her hands she moved the closed one slightly then returned it to the other palm ‘—will be in vain.’ [MASK],’ the old general said.
<name>Yoknapatawpha</name>	Yoknapatawpha	Polchek	I not only believe he is capable of enduring and will endure, but that he must endure, at least until he himself invents evolves produces a better tool than he to substitute for himself. Take my car and freedom, and I will give you [MASK].
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Mons	‘[MASK],’ the old Negro said.—‘saying to him, “Them was your folks too, wasn’t they?” and getting the sort of answer there wasn’t no reply to except just to hit him. And when the next Sunday came, he was gone.
<name>Yoknapatawpha</name>	Yoknapatawpha	Vou	We waste time.’ He looked at them, rapidly, erect still but not quite rigid. [MASK] are here. I am ...’ He looked at them again; he said again, ‘Bah. For a little time anyway we dont need secrets.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Buchwald	Come on. It will take both of us.’ [MASK] closed the safety though he still held the pistol in his hand while they struggled, all three of them or two of them to drag the French general far enough from the wall to turn him.
<name>man</name>	man	Germans	If you really hate man, all you need do is take your pistol back to the latrines and rid yourself of him.’ “Yes sir,’ the runner said, completely wooden. ‘Hate [MASK], if you must hate someone.’
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Marya	the man with the feather said harshly. ‘We have forgotten it,’ [MASK] said. ‘Take off your hat first.’ ‘I can pay you,’ the man with the feather said. You cant give me anything, see?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bridesman	‘Where are you going?’ ‘It will only take a moment,’ he said. Then apparently [MASK] saw, noticed the aeroplane too. ‘What’s wrong with your bus? You got down all right.’ ‘Nothing,’ he said.
<name>Stranger</name>	Stranger	Picklock	[MASK] said. It took them a little over four hours (‘You’d have to wait anyhow until they finish nailing up that black cloth and get away from the carriage,’ the stranger said) and there were four of them (‘Two more will be enough,’ the stranger said.
<name>scramble</name>	scramble	anneal	The crowd had only time to press frantically back and let it enter the Place and then [MASK] behind it as it shot across the Place and stopped before the Hotel in a bursting puff of dust from its clapped-to brakes.
<name>Macarthy</name>	Macarthy	James	‘So you put up a job on them,’ the lieutenant said. ‘Dont tell me: I dont want to know why. You’re going out to the — th. I know [MASK] (the lieutenant colonel commanding it).
<name>Bayard</name>	Bayard	Marthe	‘How do you expect peace to put an end to an army when even war cant?’ When they passed through the old eastern city gate this time they were all riding, [MASK] with the lines at one end of the high seat and the sister opposite with the girl between them.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Levine	And even if they do-----’ and stopped, finding them all watching him, soberly and quietly, as if he were a flight commander himself; one said: ‘What do you think, [MASK]?’ ‘Me?’ he said.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Marya	‘Pick up your money,’ [MASK] said. ‘Pick it up yourself, if you dont want it there,' the man said, filling the tumbler, splashing the wine into it until it was overfull, already raising the tumbler toward his mouth.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Levine	‘Hangars,’ he said. ‘I was to go on the patrol.’ ‘Didn’t anyone tell you to report to me here?' ‘Report?’ he said. ‘Flight Sergeant Conventicle----- No,’ he said. Tou’re-----’ ‘[MASK].’
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Polchek	the corporal said to him. ‘You went on sick parade Sunday night before we came out. Haven’t you got over it yet?’ ‘So what?’ [MASK] said. ‘Is it an issue? I had a bad belly Sunday night.
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Buchwald	‘Somebody sent for the priest out at the compound two hours ago and he aint got back yet. They cant seem to find him.’ ‘So were supposed to wait for him,’ [MASK] said in that tone of harsh calm unbearable outrage.
<name>Algren</name>	Algren	Picklock	‘I’ve got to have a drink.’ ‘No,’ [MASK] said. Toil’ll take coffee and something to eat.’ He turned to the ganymede. ‘How much money have you got left?’ ‘I gave it to you,’ the ganymede said.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Hugo	Yes, how: the man himself probably asking that in the one last choked cry or scream remaining to him of indictment and repudiation, because he didn’t know about the ribbon then either. ‘Into darkness: night: the wadi. Into hell; even [MASK] didn’t think of that.
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Tes	Perhaps you haven’t yet had time to glance through it.’ [MASK],’ he said. ‘What do you want with me?’ ‘To sit down somewhere and be quiet. As far as this squadron is concerned, the war stopped at noon.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Demont	It belongs to some people named [MASK]. The man died that same summer; I guess two wars on his land only a week apart was too much for him. His widow works it now with a hired man. Not that she needs him; she can run a plow as good as he can.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Marthe	Then she saw something else: six French sol- diers carrying a cheap wood coffin approaching the rear of the cart and even as she turned on the seat they had already set the coffin down and were drawing the tarpaulin-swaddled body from the cart. ‘Wait/ [MASK] said in her harsh strong tearless voice.
<name>History</name>	History	Flights	It’s not over. Nobody declared it for us; nobody but us shall make our peace. [MASK] will stand by as usual. Carry on.’ He didn’t think Why yet. He just thought What. He had never heard of a recess in war.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Marthe	‘But how did you know?’ [MASK] said. ‘When did you know him?’ ‘I never knew him. I never saw him. I heard about him-them—when I came back out in 16.
<name>Whitfield</name>	Whitfield	Buchwald	‘Okay,’ the sergeant-major said. ‘It’s your monkey. You ready?’ ‘Wait,’ [MASK] said. He didn’t look back to where the other two stood near the desk, watching him and the sergeant-major.
<name>Trucks</name>	Trucks	Lorries	The night again, the same sergeant-major was waiting for them—the nine from his Division and the two dozen others. ‘That’s all,’ the sergeant-major said. ‘[MASK] are waiting to take you back in.’
<name>Anse</name>	Anse	Marthe	She just took the bread from the sister and started to break it. ‘In three,’ the sister said and took the third fragment when [MASK] broke it and put it back into the basket and they reclined again, the girl between them, eating.
<name>Russian</name>	Russian	Frog	‘I want to see it from the outside too,’ the first said. ‘That’s why I volunteered for this what-ever-it-is. Ask him,’ he said, indicating the driver. ‘You can speak [MASK].’
<name>Tex</name>	Tex	Monaghan	You know what jobs in this squadron are for.’ ‘Yes. To find huns.’ ‘And then bust them.’ You sound like [MASK]: “Oh, I just ran up behind and busted the ass off the son of a bitch.” ’
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Buchwald	You know: make the whole world see that not the enemy but his own men did it.’ ‘Why didn’t they just hold him and do it?’ [MASK] said. ‘Now now,’ the sergeant-major said.
<name>Bayard</name>	Bayard	Marya	If you did, you would remember us even if I wasn’t but nine then and [MASK] eleven, because as soon as I saw your face tonight I knew that it would never need to flee, hide from, fear or dread or grieve at having to remember anything it ever looked at.
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Picklock	Yes yes,’ she said and turned, running, stiffly and awkwardly, clutching the reticule, back across the platform. ‘All right,’ [MASK] said. ‘Get it inside. One of you get the hammer out of the lorry.’
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Buchwald	I will not turn.’ ‘Jerk him around,’ [MASK] said. ‘Put that damn safety back on!’ the Negro panted, glaring back at him. ‘You want to shoot me too? Come on. It will take both of us.’
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Monaghan	‘Strangers?’ [MASK] said. ‘I’m no stranger. I’m trying to kill the son of a bitch. That's why I came two thousand miles over here: to kill them all so I can get to hell back home!’
<name>Anse</name>	Anse	Buchwald	Yeah/ the sergeant-major said. ‘If they just let me pick the general. You ready now?’ Yes,’ [MASK] said. But he didn’t move. He said: Yeah. Why us, anyway?
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Marthe	‘That’s why,’ the second sister said with that serene and happy triumph. ‘Come on,’ [MASK] said, moving. But the girl still clung to her arm. ‘I’m afraid,’ she said. ‘I’m afraid.’
<name>Snopes</name>	Snopes	Authority	He even knew what he was watching for: for the moment in the stagnancy when [MASK] would finally become aware of the clump of alien incongruous blue in its moat. Which would be at any time now; what he was watching was a race.
<name>Tremlj</name>	Tremlj	END	French: ‘That’s right,’ he said: ‘Tremlj) Never.’ ‘I am not laughing,’ the old mlan ‘What you see are tears.’ [MASK] then speaking himself in e. I’m not going to die. bending over him said.
<name>She</name>	She	Bridesman	I think he really picked you out of a hat.’ ‘Why should I not like it?’ he said. Then he said, ‘I just thought-----’ and then stopped. Thought what?’ [MASK] said. ‘Nothing,’ he said.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Bridesman	That is, not the aeroplane but the white bursts of British archie telling him or them where it was, and an S.E. (it would have to be the major; [MASK] couldn’t possibly have got that far by now) diving toward the bursts.
<name>Sheppard</name>	Sheppard	Lallemont	Though when [MASK] said, ‘I’ve something for you, if you want it,’ he realised that what he had thought was the capacity to dare was still soiled just a little with the baseless hoping which is the diet of weaklings.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bridesman	Then nothing to do forever more but work all day and sit in pubs in the evenings and then go home and sleep in a clean bed with your wife--’ [MASK] held the bottle almost like he was going to strike him with it. ‘Your word’s worth damn all.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Picklock	‘Come on with it.’ The ganymede fumbled out a small wad of paper notes and coins. [MASK] took and counted it rapidly. ‘It might do,’ he said. ‘Come on.’ There was a small bistro opposite the station.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Farrier	I was even a fair veterinary in the old days, [MASK], too. Or maybe I could even run a production line (that’s what they call it, isn’t it?) in a munitions plant.’ ‘And then?’ the group commander said.
<name>Macarthur</name>	Macarthur	Gragnon	‘Who commands here?’ he said. But before the captain could answer, a major appeared from beyond the guns. ‘[MASK] here,’ the division commander said. ‘You’re standing to, of course.’ “Yes, General,’ the major said.
<name>Wellington</name>	Wellington	Bidet	And even if they did know it, how could they afford to give [MASK] his German marshalcy at the rate of just one regiment at a time?—walking on again, saying quietly aloud this time: ‘That’s the clatter a falling general makes.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bridesman	Maybe when it’s too late and you cant help yourself anymore, you dont really mind getting killed-’ ‘I dont know,’ [MASK] said. ‘You didn’t get even one bullet hole?’ ‘No,’ he said.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Marthe	‘The murderer’s whores.’ ‘His sisters,’ [MASK] said. ‘This girl is his wife.’ ‘We heard that too,’ the woman said. The group at the next fire had left it now, and the one beyond it.
<name>Caddy</name>	Caddy	mnning	But before he could turn, the girl had already passed him, [MASK], frantic yet unerring, deer-light among the craters and what remained of the weeds and the quenchless poppies, getting smaller and smaller yet still running, back toward the house.
<name>MacDowell</name>	MacDowell	Conventicle	And for a moment he even thought of [MASK], the Flight Sergeant; he had been a soldier long enough by now to have learned that there were few, if any, military situations which the simple cry of ‘Sergeant!’ would not resolve.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Marya	Yes,’ [MASK] said. ‘But have youi gry-’ could he have come for soup first. You are hun- ‘Thanks,’ the Englishman said. He jerked his head toward the man behind him. ‘He too? Is he invited too?’
<name>Repetition</name>	Repetition	Alliances	‘[MASK]. That is what is wrong each time. The mistake we—us, and you—and you—and you—’ his hard and rigid stare jerking from face to face as he spoke ‘—have made always each time as though we will never learn.
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Buchwald	‘Now now,’ the sergeant-major said. “You dont just hold a French major-general and shoot him in the face.’ ‘Then how are we supposed to do it?’ [MASK] said. The sergeant-major looked at him. ‘
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Picklock	I’ve got a horse and cart here; it will take about four hours to go and come.’ They looked at one another. “You’ve got all night—that is, now.’ ‘All right,’ [MASK] said. ‘How much?’
<name>Al</name>	Al	Bridesman	Then the office door opened and [MASK] came out, saying, ‘All right, get your---’ and stopped, because he already had it: maps, gloves, helmet, scarf, his pistol inside the knee pocket of the sidcott.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Marya	the first man said. Yes,’ [MASK] said with her bright anc} tender and unpitying smile. The man with the crutches turned to his companion. ‘All right,’ he said in French. ‘This is them. Go ahead.’
<name>scientists</name>	scientists	Frenchmen	‘So the anarchist who is murdering [MASK] is your brother,’ the blind woman said. Still facing the woman carrying the child, she jerked her head sideways toward the girl. ‘What does she claim him as? a brother too, or maybe an uncle?’
<name>Father</name>	Father	Tou	Then he turned and went back to the desk and gathered the articles up—-basin ewer stole and crucifix—and huddled them clumsily into or onto one arm and extended his hand toward the candles and then stopped again, the corporal watching him. [MASK] can send back for them,’ the corporal said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bridesman	Or maybe just the monocle will be enough------no: just the pistol to hold in my hand.’ ‘Take your own word for it,’ [MASK] said. You were there. You saw what they shot at us, and what we were shooting at that two-seater.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Picklock	‘And in advance,’ a fourth said. ‘She cant tell anything from what’s in that box now.’ ‘I can!’ she said. ‘I will know! Just let me look.’ ‘All right,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Marthe	Even people in the towns can see it.’ ‘[MASK]!’ the girl said again. This time she grasped the other’s arm and began to jerk at it. ‘That’s what they’re all saying! They’re going to kill him!’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Grampaw	‘ “Come on, [MASK],” this boy says. “I knows where it is.” ’ ‘Yes,’ the runner said to the youth. ‘I’ll get to you in a moment too.’
<name>Al</name>	Al	Picklock	I hear they always give you a drink before you climb the steps.’ ‘Maybe we could find another—’ a fourth began. ‘Shut up,’ [MASK] said. ‘Drink that coffee. I’ve got to think.’ Then a new voice spoke.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Polchek	The two prisoners passed on through the door and into it, the sergeant then the orderly following; the iron door clashed behind them, against that room and all it contained, signified, portended; beyond it [MASK] didn’t even lower his voice: ‘They promised me brandy.
<name>Wheeler</name>	Wheeler	Buchwald	‘I aint the one that’s dissatisfied here.’ ‘Come on,’ the sergeant-major said. They went on. They reached a door; it was locked. The sergeant-major unlocked and opened it. ‘Do we report?’ [MASK] said.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Marthe	‘Pick it up yourself, if you dont want it there,' the man said, filling the tumbler, splashing the wine into it until it was overfull, already raising the tumbler toward his mouth. ‘Leave it now,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bridesman	bitter thock-thock-thock-thock on his chest and the slow virulent smell of burning cloth before he felt the heat. ‘Get it off!’ [MASK] was shouting. ‘You cant put it out! Get the sidcott off, damn it!’
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Buchwald	[MASK] said to the Negro beside him. ‘What did he say?’ ‘How in hell do I know?’ the Negro said. ‘Quick!’ he said in a panting voice. ‘That Ioway bastard. Do something about him quick.’
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bridesman	Now get rid of that thing and come on to the hut.’ ‘Right,’ he said. Then [MASK] went on and at first he didn’t dare roll up the overall to carry it. Then he thought what difference could it possibly make now.
