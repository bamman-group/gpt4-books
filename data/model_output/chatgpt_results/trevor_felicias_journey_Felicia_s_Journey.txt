<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Beth	As the shops begin to close, he judges the day a failure. Driving home again, he remembers [MASK] saying goodbye, the last moment before memory became too painful. She broke it to him suddenly: that tomorrow she planned to go south.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Johnny	‘[MASK] and myself love one another.’ The words came tone-lessly, when several minutes had passed. She didn’t cease to polish the brass while she spoke. ‘There’s no one can do anything about that.’ There was no reply.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ada	But she doesn’t say so because the engine has already been started. The car is actually moving before she realizes that the back seats are empty. ‘Your wife,’ she begins, suddenly alarmed. ‘I had to take [MASK] in last night.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Felicia	Her father’s grey head was poked out in [MASK]’s direction, a habit he had when he was serious or intent upon being understood. ‘I’m not saying it’s gospel. All I’m saying is there are certain statements made.’ ‘What statements?’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Caunce	Plus there’s that toilet dripping down through her ceiling, plus she has a tale about her telephone breaking down. [MASK] has the music and the hammering going, plus every kind of derelict up and down the stairs, so’s he can get her out.’
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Felicia	I have high hopes of the Blue Light, a feeling in my bones. To tell you the truth, it would lift me to go out. If you wouldn’t mind a drive.’ Half-heartedly, [MASK] shakes her head. ‘No.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Lena	‘The Aids brigade,’ [MASK] remarks. ‘Ever prick yourselves with a needle you pick up,’ one of the women begins in a hectoring manner, ‘you squeeze the blood out of the prick hard as you can. Really hard, much as’ll come out.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Beth	Well, you know to your cost.’ They call in at a Happy Eater on the way to the fish bar, which is a good thirty miles further off; then at the Dog and Grape, where he took [MASK] a few times.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Felicia	These sounds and the rank smell in the room pass into [MASK]’s sleep, until another sound wakes her. A woman is shouting. From somewhere lower down in the house come desperate, hysterical cries of distress. The breathing of the couple does not alter.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Odd	[MASK] the way her grammar occasionally lapses while at other times her speech is fancy, as if she’s preaching at a corner. In his mother’s day when some salesman came to the door she would call out from wherever she was that nothing was required.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Felicia	Tomorrow he’ll try again for an encounter. For several days [MASK] lodges in the Gathering House, leaving it every morning to make inquiries, to scan the faces on the streets and to travel to factories she has heard about, in other towns.
<name>lad</name>	lad	poofter	‘Corner of Brunswick Way every evening on the dot. Forty quid he’s offering.’ ‘Bloody never,’ is a disdainful comment, and: ‘Pull the one that chimes, boy.’ ‘Pull bloody nothing. Fancies a uniform, that [MASK] does.’
<name>Hospital</name>	Hospital	Jeyes	‘All done,’ someone says and it isn’t him, and there are lights and a smell that isn’t cigarettes, clean like [MASK]’ Fluid or the stuff when the sink’s blocked. The sheets are cool, a soreness is just beginning.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tapper	She sold her watch a while ago, with the cross she used to wear round her neck. She tried to sell her handbag but no one wanted it. It was [MASK] who showed her how to dispose of the watch and the cross, to a friend he knew well and trusted.
<name>him</name>	him	Lysaght	His euphoria is modest, no more than a change from what there’s been, but he is determined to hold on to it, convincing himself that if the girl were still in the neighbourhood it would surely have dawned on her by now that her father was right about [MASK] being a soldier.
<name>Dr. Juvenal Urbino</name>	Dr. Juvenal Urbino	Len	‘There’s a lot that’s in the mind when it comes to a sickness.’ ‘There probably is.’ ‘It was [MASK] was a great believer in that. All in the mind was the expression he had for it.’
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Johnny	the other woman asked, so she explained about [MASK] leaving in a hurry, how between them they had failed to make arrangements to keep in touch. ‘Before you do anything,’ the same woman laid down, ‘you have to get hold of the father.
<name>Tricky</name>	Tricky	Gaye	In a Services on the M6 a boy was familiar with [MASK]; no more than five foot that boy was, an ornamental razor blade on one of his ears and a shaved head, chunky, a trouble-maker, smelling of drink.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Felicia	I did everything you said.’ ‘It was enough what we had, [MASK]. Just sitting and talking in the places we went to, you telling me all those things. But when I looked in the driving-mirror it was in your eyes too.’
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Felicia	‘You’re beautiful,’ he whispers. ‘You’re great, [MASK].’ His lips are moist when he kisses her again, and he closes his eyes when she does, in just the same moment, as if they are one person.
<name>Mickey</name>	Mickey	Felicia	‘I need somewhere for the night.’ A car draws up beside them. ‘Business, love?’ The woman simpers as the driver winds down the window. ‘She ain’t on the game,’ she adds, jerking her head towards [MASK].
<name>Amira</name>	Amira	Felicia	‘You leave us, child. You turn your back on our people and our true belief and now there is accusations.’ Tears run over [MASK]’s cheeks as she shakes her head, denying that she has turned her back.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Felicia	‘Who are you anyway?’ came the old woman’s familiar cry. ‘What do you want with me?’ Not wishing to think about the old woman, [MASK] is not entirely successful when she tries to divert her thoughts.
<name>Mrs. Lacey</name>	Mrs. Lacey	Felicia	Their progress is slow, each litter-bin investigated, the remains of food rescued and gnawed, bottles drained of their dregs. ‘What age would you call me?’ [MASK] is asked during such a pause, and she says she doesn’t know.
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Bill	‘Where are we going, [MASK]?’ she asked again, her cigarette glowing in the dark. He said a surprise, drawing in to the lay-by where he’d once stopped to have a sandwich and a drink of tea from his Thermos.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Beth	None of this has happened. There was no girl, ever, in his house. There was no tale of a father and two twin brothers, and a bitter woman with a scar on her face. There was never [MASK]; wishful thinking, the others too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Felicia	There wasn’t one of them, not a single one in my entire recollection, [MASK], who didn’t want the matter taken care of when it arose. Every man jack, not one out of step.’ She nods, knowing what he’s referring to.
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Ada	‘You’re not in the army now?’ ‘I came out when [MASK] was first ailing. She needed care, more care than I could give, having regimental duties. No, I still help the regiment out, but it’s office stuff now.’
<name>Eileen</name>	Eileen	Felicia	A gang of hooligans push through the pedestrians, pretending to elbow them aside. In a gambling arcade men and youths, grim-faced, play the machines. [MASK]’s eyes dart about as she continues on her way, still searching in the crowd.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Felicia	‘There’s all kinds stay at the Gathering House. You need a pillow for your head? Well, here we have it for you, honey. I do not like to see you sitting out here in the wind, a prey to the coming night.’ [MASK] feels tired.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Felicia	It’s what it amounts to, as a matter of honest fact, no good denying it, no good pulling the wool. You follow me, [MASK]?’ ‘Yes, I do.’ ‘If you face the facts you can take them in your stride.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ada	Ball-bearings for the heavy-vehicle industry.’ She sits there, glancing about her for the face she’s after, not drinking her 7-Up. ‘We often looked back to our wedding day, [MASK] and myself, in later days.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Felicia	He allows a silence to gather before he says: ‘Are you thinking of having the thing terminated, [MASK]? Do they have that over there?’ ‘There’s difficulties.’ ‘You could have it done here, of course.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Felicia	Some type of dodge she has with the benefit. I wouldn’t go in with no one, [MASK], I give it to her honest. Now I’ve found the boy I ain’t looking for nothing else.
<name>love</name>	love	Felicia	Sometimes you find a cafe like this won’t do you one, but this morning they’ve struck lucky. Bacon sandwich’s, a handwritten sign advertises. ‘I think you should have something to eat, [MASK].’ ‘I’m not hungry.’
<name>Guest</name>	Guest	Felicia	An overall, mainly blue, is wrapped tightly around her. She places a boiled egg in an eggcup beside the cornflakes and a plate of toast, and places a metal teapot on a coiled wire mat. She tells [MASK] to help herself to milk and sugar.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Felicia	Earn a wage for a day and half of it’s taken off you to buy false teeth for old-age pensioners. ‘Play music, do you? Pity,’ the girl adds when [MASK] shakes her head. That evening the hostel is full when she arrives.
<name>London</name>	London	Lysaght	Then her dream is different. Her father says it’s the way the country’s going, brass plates unpolished, a holy show to the world. Her brothers eat without speaking. ‘What’s [MASK] like, though?’
<name>Mavis</name>	Mavis	Felicia	‘Move yourself.’ The woman is big, with artificial fur on the coat, and earrings shaped like hearts. [MASK] says she is only having a rest. ‘Rest yourself somewhere else then.’ ‘D’you know is the bus station open all night?’
<name>Mr. Evans</name>	Mr. Evans	Davo	She feels it with her tongue, pressing the tip of her tongue into the cavity, recalling the aching there has been. ‘There’s a woman dentist’ll fix you up.’ It was the Welshman, [MASK], who said that, and they went along together because he knew the way.
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Felicia	Still preferring to be in company than on her own, [MASK] remains with the two, returning with them the way she has come with the limping woman. They are curious at first: she tells them that she has been looking for a lawn-mower factory because a friend works there.
<name>She</name>	She	Felicia	All she wants to do is to make certain she didn’t leave anything behind. ‘You left nothing.’ The woman is emphatic. [MASK] goes away. She makes the rounds of the other bed-and-breakfast houses, but without success.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Ada	His voice is no more than a whisper, not like it was when she accosted him yesterday to ask if she’d come to the right place, or when he called out from his car at her. [MASK] is his wife, he says, a caring woman.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Felicia	That’s all I’m saying to you.’ There was a silence in the kitchen then. Her father sat straight and upright in his chair, not doing anything with his hands, gazing in front of him at nothing. [MASK] picked up another piece of brass.
<name>love</name>	love	Felicia	It’s a disappointment for her, of course: he understands that, he says. ‘Bear with me a minute, [MASK], while I put in a quick call to check out the state of play. Only it’s occurred to me there’s a bloke
<name>Blackwell</name>	Blackwell	Blackwell	‘I think you’ll find us competitive,’ the Crosse and [MASK]’s rep contends later still, in the office. ‘Grossed up, I’d say those terms are out of competition’s reach.’ It’s not of interest; it doesn’t matter.
<name>Letty</name>	Letty	Ada’d	‘I don’t want to keep you from the hospital.’ ‘[MASK] want me to give you what help I could. A young girl wandering isn’t recommended in this part of the world, you know. You hear shocking things sometimes.’
<name>Laurel</name>	Laurel	Felicia	Aware that her mute presence has misled the people of the Gathering House, [MASK] does her best to dispel the illusion her arrival has engendered, but no one listens. And the more they do not do so the more it is borne in upon her that she is accepting their hospitality under false pretences.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Wilf	He says the word again, mumbling through the rest of the sentence because in the time he can’t think of anything coherent to say. He smiles at the receptionist. It could happen to a bishop, he wants to say, that expression of his Uncle [MASK]’s.
<name>Meeting</name>	Meeting	Jubilee	He should have opened the door and told these people once and for all to clear off. ‘In the future, another Prayer [MASK] will be upon us and you have rooms unoccupied, sir. With the folk who come then, you may go forth in the joy of the Message.’
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Ada’d	Trouble over the girlfriend, family at arm’s length. I used to father the poor lads, if you get my meaning. I’d bring them back to the house and [MASK] give them tea and pies and cake, a whole spread she’d have.
<name>her</name>	her	Johnny	Didn’t you want to get the thing done then?’ ‘I wasn’t right to think about it without [MASK] knew. It was only I couldn’t think what to do for the best.’ ‘I’m cognizant of all that, dear.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Felicia	‘Leave me alone, please.’ ‘They said they were going and I asked them why, but I didn’t have to, [MASK]. You understand that, dear? You appreciate what I’m saying to you?’ ‘I’ll go away.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Felicia	[MASK] says it is money. She might have taken it out from where it was and put it down somewhere, although she doesn’t recall doing so. ‘No money was found.’ ‘Would it be possible to look, just to make sure?’
<name>She</name>	She	Felicia	3 Since she arrived in the town that morning [MASK] has discovered that she cannot always understand what people say because they speak in an accent that is unfamiliar to her. Even when they repeat their statements there is a difficulty, and sometimes she has to give up.
<name>Posy</name>	Posy	Sharon	Posh, [MASK] said. ‘Sorry.’ The present girl blows her nose on a tissue she has been twisting between her fingers. People are definitely noticing now, a man and a woman waiting for chips at the counter, a girl and a youth in a booth across the aisle.
<name>God</name>	God	Felicia	A child hugs a swan, yachts sail on a distant lake. ‘That, now, is the paradise earth,’ a black woman asserts, a long forefinger drawing [MASK]’s attention to a trickling waterfall, to giraffes and then to cockatoos.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Felicia	‘She won’t find him.’ ‘If anyone can find your friend that girl can. I promise you that, [MASK].’ When the fish bar closes they move on, and only call in once more, at a Little Chef that surprisingly is still open.
<name>George</name>	George	Lena	Several rust-marked mattresses, two of them occupied, lie close together on the floor. ‘There you go.’ The man in the bomber jacket smiles another welcome at the three newcomers. ‘OK then?’ [MASK] says the accommodation is fine.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Felicia	Though I had a relative who used to talk about it. Beautiful country, I understand.’ ‘It’s all right.’ ‘You work at something, [MASK]?’ ‘I had work in a canning factory. It closed a while back.’
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Felicia	All he’s intent upon is helping her. ‘I know.’ ‘We’ll get you home afterwards. Don’t worry about that.’ ‘Anything you lend me I’ll send back. Every penny.’ ‘I have no doubt, [MASK].’
<name>her</name>	her	Felicia	‘I was worried about you,’ a voice says, and the bespectacled face of the fat man who helped her yesterday is there in a doorway. He speaks softly, his expression full of the concern he refers to, his sudden presence, and what he says, bewildering [MASK].
<name>town</name>	town	MacSweeney	It’s hot when they come out of the wood where the bluebells are, she can feel it on her head. Her father takes one hand and she holds the bluebells in the other. The hinge on the watch is faulty, he says, he must get it fixed in [MASK]’s.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Johnny	Sweet as sugar, and then they’re working like adders.’ Her fingers ran slowly down the mark on her cheek. ‘Wouldn’t hurt a fly,’ she said, ‘until the moment comes. “What about [MASK]?” I said to his father.
<name>Miss Prism</name>	Miss Prism	Ada	‘It was understandable, you scuttling off like that the other week, dear. I passed that incident on to [MASK] when she had a bright moment and she said it was understandable. I only mention it because I wouldn’t want you to think there was offence taken.’
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Felicia	At a time like this —’ ‘It does you good to get it out, [MASK].’ He adds that he’s glad she felt she could. They’re being eyed now by the old man, who has tired of his newspaper.
<name>Something</name> (uncertain)	Something (uncertain)	Felicity	‘Yes.’ ‘Do you mind if I ask you your name?’ She tells him; he doesn’t tell her his. ‘I never heard that one,’ he says instead. ‘[MASK] we have over here.’
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Felicia	A few minutes later she descends to the dining-room, where a single place is laid, a plate of cornflakes already waiting. When the woman with the hatchet face comes in she says something about sleep, and [MASK] replies that she slept like a log.
<name>the mother</name>	the mother	Felicia	‘Do you know that for a fact, [MASK]? Have you heard from someone it was the mother?’ ‘It was her. I’d swear to it now.’ ‘So you’ve heard from no one back home since you got here?’
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Felicia	Bitter as a sloe, people called this woman. The crowd is dwindling in the bus station, but [MASK] still stands where she has taken up her position, by a refreshment kiosk that has closed. No buses are arriving now and only a few remain, waiting to set off.
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Felicia	I do the cleaning myself.’ [MASK] explains that as a result of what has happened she has very little money left. All she wants to do is to make certain she didn’t leave anything behind. ‘You left nothing.’ The woman is emphatic.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Felicia	Overhearing this conversation, a middle-aged man with waist-length hair and torn clothes says [MASK] is wasting her time, an opinion confirmed by a girl trailing a dog on a string. The girl has a safety-pin hanging from a nostril.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Johnny	All I’m saying is there are certain statements made.’ ‘What statements?’ ‘That he joined the British army.’ ‘[MASK] works in a factory stores. Lawn-mower parts.’ He nodded thoughtfully and slowly, as if agreeing.
<name>Che</name>	Che	Felicia	There is a newspaper cutting about this person in her father’s albums, a photograph of a hard-faced woman in military uniform. ‘It’s nice,’ he says, ignoring the information about the revolutionary woman. ‘[MASK] has a ring to it.’
<name>Melanie</name>	Melanie	Felicia	Maybe when you go back to the hospital they’ll tell you —’ ‘I know what they’ll tell me, [MASK].’ He doesn’t mind crying in public. His sobs come softly, tears caught for a moment against the rims of his glasses.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Felicia	[MASK] doesn’t beg as she continues on her journey. At this time of day people don’t like being bothered because they’re in a hurry to get to work. She’s not in a hurry herself. The sun comes out, dispersing wispy clouds, warming her face and hair.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Felicia	[MASK] pours tea, finishes her cornflakes, and slowly spreads butter on a piece of toast. She cracks open the top of her egg. In the kitchen her father would be easing the bacon slices from the pan, slipping a knife under them where they have become stuck.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Johnny	Since you’ve come so far with so much at stake? For starters, will they welcome you back?’ She has her carrier bags with her and hasn’t put them down. ‘I’d rather find [MASK],’ she whispers, sobs catching on the words.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Lena	There is no lavatory paper. She doesn’t like the room when she returns to it. She doesn’t like the house. [MASK] has taken her coat off, revealing a tight black imitation-leather skirt and a black jumper, which she now removes also.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Felicia	She brushes her teeth and a woman beside her picks up the toothbrush when she puts it down on the edge of the basin. ‘God, I’m sorry!’ the woman apologizes when [MASK] protests. ‘I thought it was the ship’s.’
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Felicia	‘Get off our property now.’ Riding back, [MASK] wept and the oozing of her tears became a flow that blinded her. When finally they ceased she dismounted in order to wipe away the traces from her cheeks and to blow her nose.
<name>Babette</name>	Babette	Child	She says there is happiness for the one who dies. ‘[MASK], we live in a miracle. Look here at this garden, honey. See the fruits of the trees and the peoples of all nations. See the juice to drink and the smiles of the children.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Buddy	He returns to the counter for another cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits. She protests again that she can’t go on being a nuisance to him, and again he contradicts her, saying she is a help. They leave [MASK]’s Cafe soon after that and return to the hospital.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Thompson	[MASK]’s went bust two years ago.’ ‘Is there anywhere here that makes lawn-mowers?’ The man says definitely not and an hour later, in a police station, her question is repeated. ‘Anywhere on lawn-mowers these days?’
<name>she</name>	she	Hilditch	When he asked who [MASK] was she clammed up. No one much, she said. The brush salesman spread out his brushes for her, even though she’d called out nothing today when she heard him at the door. ‘He certainly can make you laugh!’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Felicia	‘Looking for a kip, dear?’ [MASK] is addressed by a limping woman who is pushing a pram full of rags, with plastic bags tied around the belt of her coat. The woman’s face is crimson and gnarled, her eyes bloodshot.
<name>Brenda</name>	Brenda	Felicia	When the meal was over and the washing-up completed [MASK] changed out of her jersey and skirt and put on make-up in the bedroom, beadily observed by the old woman, who was always alert after she’d eaten. ‘You’re going out, girl?’
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Ada	[MASK] would have wanted today.’ The music is soft enough to permit their conversation; they don’t have to raise their voices. She is in no fit state to travel anywhere: gently he says so. ‘You said you couldn’t face them, dear.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lafferty	His own father and his mother are dead, but he still has his grandmother. They go into [MASK]’s shop and he has some of her lemonade because he is thirsty, too. He carries her on his shoulders and she can smell the tang of tobacco on him.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Beth	He doesn’t want to hear it, but it’s there anyway: she doesn’t care how she appears to him because she sees him in a certain light. She has guessed, as [MASK] guessed, the first of the others to do so.
<name>he</name>	he	Felicia	Specialist stuff.’ ‘If you could just give me the name of the factory,’ [MASK] begins to say, but is interrupted at once by the doubt that spreads through the plump features in the shadows of the doorway. ‘It’s difficult, that.
<name>Lucky Strike</name>	Lucky Strike	Marlboro	‘Is the old lady OK, these days?’ She said she was. In her hundredth year, she said, and he wagged his head in wonderment. He smiled again and she watched him smoking. [MASK], it said on the packet on the table.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Carmel	In the Church of Our Saviour she had been thinking that her shoulders were ungainly, that her face hadn’t responded to the softening attentions of [MASK]’s make-up, that no doubt her hair had gone limp.
<name>Creedon</name>	Creedon	Johnny	On the Creagh road a car going by sounds its horn; [MASK] waves because it’s someone he knows, and then they turn off into the Mandeville woods. People are made for one another, he murmurs, his lips kissing her hair and her neck.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Felicia	‘You’re going out, girl?’ her father asked, seeing her with her coat on. When she said she was he expressed no further interest. Her mother would have been curious, [MASK] thought, from what she could remember of her.
<name>It</name>	It	Felicia	‘[MASK]’s a nice name,’ she says. A white dog sniffs her foot and she cries. The tall woman puts a finger into the dog’s mouth to show it won’t bite. The music is still playing, and the voice is singing.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Felicia	An elderly Ethiopian relates his to [MASK], most of them to do with the ringing of doorbells. ‘You are not amongst us by chance,’ he adds, ‘for there is nothing that can happen but by the Commandment that began in the garden of pleasure.
<name>Mrs. Oliver</name>	Mrs. Oliver	Sheffield	[MASK]’s easily far enough away. ‘The only thing is,’ he says, ‘I think I’m right in stating that if there’s any irregularity you can be going back and forth to a local surgery till the cows come home.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Beth	She’s going back to less than nothing. He doesn’t understand why she can’t see that. [MASK] couldn’t see it, either, when he put it to her that it was foolish to move south.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Len	‘Dearie me,’ he responds, as he always does in a calamity. He watches while a crowd gathers round the faulty extractor, [MASK] from the finishing shed who’s always called in for this kind of repair, and most of the kitchen staff.
