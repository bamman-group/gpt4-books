<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Czar	Always ivory pale, [MASK]’s skin now took on a curious clay color like the waxen skin of the dead. His voice was low, monotonous, too controlled, as though it might have risen to a scream if he were to unleash it for only a moment.
<name>George</name>	George	Christine	She said the one who helped her off the can had hands of goodness and that they were work hands, too.” “Now who’s being sentimental?” [MASK] demanded. “It’s dark in there, and stuffy, and it can’t be healthy.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Addie	patchouli, it always is in the novels —and sawdust and beer and cigars. Maybe it’s ghosts.” The two men were looking at her quietly, fondly. Her voice trailed off. Silence for a moment. Here it comes, [MASK] thought.
<name>Spock</name>	Spock	Ross	“I suppose so. Oh, [MASK]!” “I’ve got to go. Can you make it to the airport all right?” “Of course.” “Fascinating ethnological fact. In the Eskimo language there’s no word for good-bye.”
<name>her</name>	her	Christine	Almost wistfully he mused aloud. “I’d have liked [MASK] to be a— what was it?—a-----” “She isn’t. If you repeat any of this I’ll deny it. I’ll deny it as a joke.
<name>The butcher</name>	The butcher	Ross	I can’t bear to look at those whole lambs hanging up by their heels in the butcher shop, with the neck sticking out. But lamb chops are delicious and this probably is too. . . . How do you cook it?” [MASK] stood in silence.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Addie	“I’m just trying to get this stuff out, we’re going to press at three—” “No, not now, [MASK]. Not here. I’ll drop in on you at the house tonight about eight.” “Oh, dearie, it’s a mess!
<name>the stewardess</name>	the stewardess	Thor	His grayish face, his graying hair, the eyeglasses, the gray gloves, the topcoat, gave him the look of a retired insurance salesman, perhaps, or an accountant who had cannily invested in an annuity. “You can relax and enjoy every minute of the trip,” [MASK] assured him.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Czar	That’s just about the idea. [MASK]. You’ve just about hit it.” Now the ice mass broke with a crash. The fine gray eyes were almost white, the color drained from the cheeks, leaving them clay. “Listen to me, old crackpot!
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Christine	Much cheaper to give it to [MASK] and let me tell you now. Besides all the trouble.” “How will I know you’re telling the truth?” “You will know. From past experience.” He laughed then as at a little private joke.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Christine	Forgive me. Oh, [MASK], forgive me.” She wiped her eyes, she blew her nose, there was about her the air of finality which marks not only the close of a scene but the end of a period in a fife.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Chris	Years later, when [MASK], in exhibitionistic and self-conscious mood, sometimes was impelled to shock conventional society with the story of her infancy, these two gory tales of her parents’ death were met with a sort of hysterical mirth.
<name>Mrs. Raffsky</name>	Mrs. Raffsky	Bridie	But the Raffsky girls had propelled her into the kitchen under their own power—a kitchen that was modern, metallic and pastel as a Ladies Home Journal double-page ad. “Just throw your eye over that, would you,” [MASK] said.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Czar	Perhaps you know a little more about the reason for that than I do. Long ago you barely prevented them from stopping my advertisers altogether with threats. My tardy thanks for that, [MASK].” “Who told you that!” He stopped himself, abruptly.
<name>salmon</name>	salmon	Salmon	“The net catches the fish.” “But it isn’t as simple as that. They put that webbing in the water- ways where they know the migrating fish will pass on their way to the spawning streams, [MASK] are wonderful creatures, you know.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chris	In a comer of the vast bright dining hall he was bent over some work spread on a bared table. He was sewing. Then [MASK] realized that the long leisurely gesture of the man’s arm was that of embroidering.
<name>Jack London</name>	Jack London	Czar	Him and that big Swede, too. Who do they think they are, anyway!” “You’re just sore because your claim dribbled out on you,” a more reasoning one would say. “Why don’t you do like [MASK] does?
<name>Jack London</name>	Jack London	Kennedy	“No. Not here.” Piqued, [MASK] pressed on. “I suppose you’re hell-bent for gold, like the rest of those fools in there?” He jerked a thumb in the direction of the lights, the shouts, the music.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Czar	Which he now proceeded to do, but gently. This was years ago, and the straggling little town certainly seemed to justify [MASK]’s pessimism. Yet somehow a building or two was added to the rather ramshackle one on the hill. And another. And another.
<name>McCandless</name>	McCandless	Bridie	“Fascinating ethnological fact. In the Eskimo language there’s no word for good-bye.” He ran swiftly toward the waiting plane. “Give in, [MASK]. Here’s a Company parka, everybody uses them, you can wear it until we leave tomorrow.
<name>the union</name>	the union	Kleet	“What about him?” “He’s raising a stink, that’s what. Papers outside are copying his stuff, he’s been running articles and editorials and so on, he’s got a column full of snide remarks about me and [MASK] and the whole cannery crowd.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Chris	Now she’s reading the note, [MASK] decided a moment later. Now she’s taking out the pills. Oh, wouldn’t it be wonderfull I can’t stand a night of this. The shouting rose and fell. Mutterings and groans from the occupants of the other cubbyholes.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Thor	“Security,” [MASK] said, quietly. “All women want security. And they’re right, in a way. But the whole country may go down to min if people want security more than anything else.” “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Kennedy	“Your collar’s turned the right way, but you sure talk like a preacher.” A quarter of a century later they could laugh about it, ruefully. A hundred times [MASK] had said, almost nostalgically, “Do you recall that night out on deck?
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Distelhorst	“Says he’s doing fine.” He floundered back to the Kennedy car. [MASK] stuck his head out of the window. He waved a blithe hand; a great grin gashed the strangely unlined middle-aged face.
<name>Old Sport</name>	Old Sport	Dave	You know. But what I want to talk about now, these few minutes, is what line do I take if they ask me for a few remarks at this luncheon?” “You know what you say, [MASK]. You say what you always say.”
<name>Jack London</name>	Jack London	Christine	You know that, [MASK]. Work. Food. Keeping warm. Getting from place to place somehow, if you have to. The dog pack to feed if you’re traveling by dog sled. Just living is a land of triumph from day to day.”
<name>Snakes</name>	Snakes	Cobras	“Everybody he meets, he picks their brains, quiet and smooth as a cobra.” “[MASK] don’t pick brains. Leastways, if they did they’d have a sorry meal off yours.” “Oh, so that’s the way it is!
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Thor	“I don’t like it anyway.” “Like it or not, you’ll eat it, young lady!” “Why do I have to?” “Because I say so.” [MASK] made a sort of game of his lessons in food values.
<name>Sam Spade</name>	Sam Spade	Czar	She placed one hand on his shoulder as though to balance herself, she stood a little above him on her perch, smiling down on the big beefy face. [MASK]’s cold voice, “You familiar with the cannery business.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Christine	For the first time in her life [MASK] felt disembodied, without dimensions. “This is the assembly line, see. Those girls are on piece work. . . . Those others there are patchers. . . . Those guys cleaners . . . cutters . . .
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Thor	Do you think that Eskimo boy is good enough for our Chris I Do you?” He looked at her then, quizzically. Horrified at what she had said, she was filled with contrition. “Oh, [MASK], I forgot I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Angeline	[MASK] laughed aloud, then, and pointed with one encarmined hand to where her husband stood, busy with his boat. Over the rim of the trestled boat’s edge a red sombrero rose above a pair of black eyes.
<name>sweetheart</name>	sweetheart	Butterfly	“Come on in here,” she said, maneuvering the distraught creature into the back room. “Now just sit down, [MASK], and tell me all about it.” For a few minutes she listened quietly to the flood of invective.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Addie	“Just a minute, you two boys.” [MASK] laughed. “I’m kind of a tawny type myself, if you can spare me a look, but I don’t see anybody battling about whether I’m a lion or a tiger or an apricot.”
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Ross	The two pretty airplane hostesses emerged from the waiting-room door and hailed a yellow taxi at the curb. Now a third figure, smart in the blue uniform of a pilot, came through the doorway. "[MASK]!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ott	The boy’s lively face became utterly impassive, he said nothing. “No,” [MASK] replied, “not Eskimo. They’re natives.” “Aren’t Eskimos natives?” “No. Well, they’re native but they’re not Natives.
<name>Aunt Beast</name>	Aunt Beast	Addie	It was said her screeches made the noise of a jet plane just then passing overhead seem, in comparison, like the cooing of a dove. [MASK] was waiting. “Come on in here,” she said, maneuvering the distraught creature into the back room.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Bridie	“My!” she said aloud to no one. “Smells elegant.” She often talked to herself thus as people do who live alone. Everyone she passed greeted her. Hi, [MASK]! . . .
<name>darling</name>	darling	Dave	martinis or vodka, though I’m taking bourbon and so can anyone else. . . . Three-inch steaks, so there’ll be plenty even for you, [MASK], rare, medium, or well done. Those baked potatoes the way they do ’em
<name>he</name>	he	Thor	“You’re fixing this up for her, aren’t you?” It was as though, in working for her comfort or delight, they somehow moved closer to her life. “No sign of her coming back,” [MASK] replied.
<name>Auntie Mame</name>	Auntie Mame	Nature	“[MASK] has a wonderful way of taking care of you, if you’ll only heed her. Take salmon.” “Ugh! The natives eat it all the time, you can smell it even when they walk past you down the street.”
<name>John</name>	John	Thor	If people want higher education for their boys and girls, why, they can send them Outside. Broaden them. Give them a picture of life outside the confines of the Territory.” [MASK] had said, “Who can afford that? You can.
<name>Dirk</name>	Dirk	Bridie	And a bedroom, leave us piously hope, for her.” “I knew itl” [MASK] crowed. “I had a hunch this morning early something stinking was on the fire. I just thought I’d go up and check the Ice Palace V.I.P. suite.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Grandma	And having things done for her? She’s so old and feeble.” “[MASK] isn’t really that old and she’s as tough as that thread she’s making. She’s doing what she wants to do, she’s earning her way, she loves it.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Thor	Chattily, [MASK] leaned against the doorjamb. “That’s interesting. Anyone we know?” “Might be.” With apparent reluctance he left the car and walked leisurely up the path, surveying the house with the remote and casual glance of a stranger.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Bridie	It was Sunday morning, it was ten o’clock, there actually was hot water, the toilet worked, the house was too hot but all Alaska houses were too hot. Slacks, mukluks, sweater, parka. [MASK]’s voice somewhere down the hall. Breakfast.
<name>Strangler</name>	Strangler	Thor	Now, [MASK], we know his gait and speed and conformation and staying power. But you get a dark horse in there, he’s anybody’s guess. So I say, let sleeping dogs lie.” “But he ain’t sleeping!”
<name>Uncle Henrik</name>	Uncle Henrik	Thor	“Three or four more like this catch,” [MASK] said, “and your schooling for this coming year will be paid for.” Miserably she said, “It isn’t worth it. I’d rather never know how to read or add two and two.”
<name>Tom Buchanan</name>	Tom Buchanan	Dave	Again, as in the Mort Caswell office, the photograph was an office fixture like the glowing colors of the oriental rugs, the pictures of ships, the ship models on the carved oak mantel. A handsome old-fashioned room that resounded now to the boom of [MASK]’s voice.
<name>Miss Lonelyhearts</name>	Miss Lonelyhearts	Bridie	Any woman would be wild over it.” [MASK] jerked her hat, which she had worn throughout lunch, she straightened herself in her chair, she sniffed. “I live in one room in the Ice Palace. From choice. I’d think two rooms a burden.
<name>Machiavelli</name>	Machiavelli	Christine	Sometimes they talked behind their hands, their faces were like those [MASK] had seen in the portraits on the walls of Italian galleries, depicting thirteenth-century Florentine political plotters, the look, the gestures, the planes of the crafty faces were the same.
<name>Quinhagak</name>	Quinhagak	Thor	Now.” She glanced up as a silver shape drummed in the sky, banked, circled, was off across the interminable tundra. “I see,” [MASK] said, quietly. “We’ll miss him. He knows this part of our world.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Bridie	The window was fastened and nailed tight against the cold. She was used to that, too. A yellow window shade, futile against the sun. Oh, well. Hastily she scrawled a note and pinned it on [MASK]’s door.
<name>the ceiling</name>	the ceiling	Thor	Time and Life magazines, sirloin steaks, frozen strawberries; shoes, chocolate cookies, lamps, pink plastic tables; frying pans, double boilers, mukluks, gloves, bolts and screws. Impressed but disappointed, her baffled gaze turned toward [MASK]. Her expression was vaguely reproachful.
<name>Cannery</name>	Cannery	Bergstrom	[MASK] smelled of fish oil and salmon even more distinctly than this temple of salmon itself. It was as though his pores had absorbed the effluvium through the years, soaked it in like the spongy floor boards of the cannery, and now exuded it.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Czar	If I was your own ma I wouldn’t know what to advise you, looking at him now.” “Haven’t I had too much advice all my life?” “I guess you have, at that. [MASK] pulling you one way, Thor the other.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thor	Ratty.”) came occasionally to argue with [MASK] as he went about his boatbuilding task there by the waterside so near his one-room cabin. She had peered into the cabin before she came down to join him as he hammered, sawed, sandpapered, calked, painted.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Chris	For example, though her laugh was merry, her way lighthearted, [MASK]’s statements were sometimes dramatic. Listeners were likely to recall them, thoughtfully, following the more spectacular moments of their trip. “Yes,” she would agree, apparently in charming deference to the stranger’s comment.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Alaska	There never was sufficient room for the long legs. “I had some of that caribou steak myself for my supper,” he said. “I wish to apologize to the guests, in the name of [MASK]. Tough as a blacksmith’s apron.”
<name>she</name>	she	Bridie	They always avoided being trapped at the Speakers’ Table. From choice they sat below the salt. They noted everything. Such comments as they made were sotto voce. Even [MASK] managed to drop her voice to a confidential tone. Their comment was professional and without illusion.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Distelhorst	Say, that’s interesting.” [MASK] took out a notebook and, somewhat handicapped by his fur-lined gloves, scribbled industriously for a moment. “Well, now, how long you been here?” “I’ve been here all my life.
<name>Rhodium</name>	Rhodium	Nick	Affably mingling with these lowly members of the native geological family were stones streaked with silver, lumps flecked with gold, chunks veined with copper; a scattering of tungsten, nickel, cobalt, chrome, tin. There were even crumbs of precious platinum, [MASK] being a perfectionist.
<name>Mr. Bloom</name>	Mr. Bloom	Thor	“Let’s give it a waltz, [MASK]. For old time’s sake. I’ve waltzed in my day to a jig tune. Once around and we’ll quit or I’ll be dead on my feet.” In a sort of stately court minuet they moved off into the maelstrom.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Bridie	“Now,” [MASK] would say, and he tried to listen as he sat there at her desk side, “now you want to get her a nice corsage. I’d say one orchid is better than a whole bunch of other flowers, they just love ’em.
<name>Eden</name>	Eden	Chris”—he	[MASK] looked uncertainly at her—“Chris, you want to come along up and see if these folks are comfortable?” She assumed her best Outside manner. “So sorry. I’ll have to leave you. It’s interesting—having you here.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Bridie	“That’s interesting. Anyone we know?” “Might be.” With apparent reluctance he left the car and walked leisurely up the path, surveying the house with the remote and casual glance of a stranger. “Could be. [MASK], say.
<name>The Wedding Planner</name>	The Wedding Planner	Bridie	She found herself repeatedly acting the role of bridesmaid at the wedding of two people she never before had laid eyes on. The pattern of the weddings almost always was the same. [MASK] conferred with the scared and inarticulate young bridegroom.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Christine	“You can’t meet [MASK]’s expenses for two years.” “She’ll have everything the other girls have. The salmon fishing brings me in quite a bit, if it’s a good season, and your friends’ fish traps don’t take them all.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Lubbock	They talked quietly, leisurely, one would have thought, from their manner, that their subject was, perhaps, philanthropy. “Thing to do is put pressure on him, give him the screws.” “[MASK] says he wants to see the situation from every angle before he makes his report.”
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Thor	[MASK] went on rubbing the wood lightly, he even breathed on it a little and then resumed his rubbing and cocked his head, gazing critically at the glow of the spot on which he was working as though to compare it in rich color and sheen to the section next it.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Bridie	The old days I remember the audiences some of them, down front, used to try to duck under their seats they thought I would lose my grip and let her fly right over the footlights into their laps.” [MASK] minced precariously up the aisle now, a laden paper plate in either hand.
<name>love</name>	love	Stopped	“Why didn’t you ever tell me you had a son? It seems so strange you never told me you had a son.” “I was afraid I’d lose you.” “You can’t lose what you---” She caught herself. [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Addie	By the time [MASK] and I get through the week of being editors, reporters, linotype operators, proofreaders, compositors—and then run the paper off the press—we don’t get a chance to poll the readers.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Thor	“I’ll bring you a chair from the kitchen, [MASK].” “No, I won’t be staying but a minute.” “Tell her then. Or do you want me to?” “You’re young and in love.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Christine	The fine gray eyes were almost white, the color drained from the cheeks, leaving them clay. “Listen to me, old crackpot! You’re fixing up this place for [MASK]. You think she’ll come back here to live. Well, stop kidding yourself.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Chris	“For that matter, another promise from you.” “No, you don’t! And I’m not so sure about the first. I hand ten thousand dollars over to [MASK]. What for? She isn’t of age, what do you do?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Chris	She took part in the social life of the college and the town, but there was some complaint among the more amorous young men and the frivolous young women. “[MASK] is fun,” they said, the one to the other. “She can do anything.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Chris	I tell you, [MASK], they ain’t. It’s just important, something’s got to be settled. No, now. Right now. I don’t care if you might win a hundred thousand dollars in the ice breakup, anyway it’s always won by some construction worker nobody ever heard of.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Bridie	You build banks and movie houses and high buildings. You pretend to be plain and simple. You love power and position.” “You two,” [MASK] commanded, emerging from her daze, “stop calling each other names and get practical.
<name>Lions</name>	Lions	Moose	Or about him, either. Wild animals. [MASK] and bears. They wouldn’t believe it. I heard it was in the newspapers, but I never looked. I couldn’t. I don’t believe it yet. Nobody would believe it.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Chris	[MASK] pressed both hands flat to her stomach as though she were about to be sick. “All!” she cried, her voice so high and clear that the gallery turned to stare at her even as they began to move out and up through the exits.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Czar	Leastways, if they did they’d have a sorry meal off yours.” “Oh, so that’s the way it is! You’re in [MASK]’s pay, the way a lot of them are.” “I’m in nobody’s pay.
<name>mind</name>	mind	Chris	“It’s a parka,” rather lamely. “We pronounce it parky. Don’t ask me why.” “All that white fur! It’s so dramatic. Like a costume in a musical.” A poker term came to [MASK]’s mind.
<name>Bearer</name>	Bearer	Christine	Then you’ll punish her.” “You talk too much, like most old men. Gab gab gab.” “I’ll make it brief as possible. You’ll write a check now, made out to [MASK] for ten thousand dollars.
<name>Mrs. MacReady</name>	Mrs. MacReady	Chris	The man was plump, eyeglassed, almost comical in a Basque beret, a city topcoat, and good gray gloves. They’ll be miserable, [MASK] thought. It turned out she was wrong. In the forward seat facing the wall sat a young Eskimo huddled in a blanket.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Thor	Together she and [MASK] trudged the hills, fished the waters, slogged through the tundra gathering the delicate low-growing wild flowers, picking the low-bush wild cranberries for jelly. There were blueberries, too, and salmon berries.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Bridie	“Not that one. That’s for dessert with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge sauce. Though maybe if I cut you a little bit of a slice now, from the side . . “I’ll wait,” [MASK] decided.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Bridie	She must have slept a little. Someone sat in the seat beside her, she opened her eyes instantly. It was only [MASK], who leaned close, her voice vibrant with the eagerness of one who imparts news. “Those two,” she confided.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Kennedy	Now there was something of distrust and disappointment in the narrow look with which [MASK] regarded his deck companion. “Your collar’s turned the right way, but you sure talk like a preacher.” A quarter of a century later they could laugh about it, ruefully.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Miss	[MASK]—uh—?” “And you don’t like your father, lots of people don’t like their fathers. And you’re bored with his business. If you cared more about people—I mean if you knew what’s going on.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Kennedy	[MASK] thought (with one small part of his quick mind only) that this fellow sounded like one of those Fourth of July orators back home. But he no longer felt chilly. He stared hard into the man’s face, his own face tense.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Thor	“I want this settled now. Today.” “Neurotic behavior,” [MASK] observed; and strolled over to the glass-fronted bookcase where he stood surveying the titles, a look of unbelief on his face.
<name>Humanity</name>	Humanity	Man	“They’re almost mythical animals now, except the fur seal. [MASK]’s greed destroyed these magnificent and valuable creatures years ago.” “Damn shame. Well, kind of chilly out here, guess I’ll—”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Ross	“Heh, [MASK], give us a hand.” And flung at him the end of a long thick rope. The men at work with him in the water flung another rope and another and another curling toward other strong deft hands on shore.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Christine	You’d be so comfortable. Won’t you? If only to keep the mice away.” “An old fellow like me wants to stay in his own lair, like the woods’ creatures. . . . [MASK]?”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Bridie	Right now. I don’t care if you might win a hundred thousand dollars in the ice breakup, anyway it’s always won by some construction worker nobody ever heard of. Well, you get yourself over here, your Grandpas say.” [MASK] hung up.
<name>sonny</name>	sonny	Buster	Only one—the youngest among them—said very low to his seatmate, “The old guy has lost his marbles.” But the older man said, “You should be as smart as him when you’re his age. Or now, [MASK].”
<name>Columbo</name>	Columbo	Distelhorst	“Pardon me,” [MASK] went on, a trace of irritation in his voice. “I’d like to finish this interrogation, clear up a little research and follow through, if you’ll just bear with me a minute longer. This is important.
<name>She</name>	She	Christine	Suddenly, “[MASK] know this? Any of it?” “No, no! I told you that. That’s the bargain.” “What would her—uh—her title be?” “Nothing.”
