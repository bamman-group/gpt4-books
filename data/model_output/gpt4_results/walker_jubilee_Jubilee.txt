<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Nossah	Course I ain’t got room for nuff to make wine. Now gentlemen, that’s what I does with my weeds!” “You sure you ain’t got no pizen in there, has you?” “[MASK], I ain’t fooling with no pizen.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Lucy	[MASK] always seemed to be lingering around when there was much conversation, and it became patently clear that she was always listening to what other people were saying. They assumed that she was just idling and dawdling at her work.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Wheeler	“They’re in [MASK]’s cavalry, yes, but you never can tell whether they’re together. I did feel a little uneasy at the time of the battle, but my mind tells me he’s alive and I feel sure of that.”
<name>David</name>	David	Jim	[MASK] beamed, and the other children smiled at him with awe and admiration. “Of course he can. He’s always been quick and he’ll learn fast. Sure he can be a teacher. That’s what our race needs now more than anything else.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lee	Now he’s got running of the reins.” Then [MASK] continued, “Last January all my nigras took down with awful bad colds and whooping cough and fevers. I thought they’d cough their insides out before spring when they suddenly got well.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Salina	brooded [MASK]. Besides she had her own clothes to think about, three new dresses, one a very brilliant plum satin with bugle beads and tucks and flounces trimmed with tiny pink satin rosebuds with embroidered green leaves, fitting closely through the bodice and falling behind in a regal train.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vyry	In less than a month she grew so much worse that before they realized her trouble she was dead, dying one night on her own pallet after having cooked supper and worked all day. [MASK] took her place in the emergency. Thus began her life as cook in the Big House.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Maw	“Can’t you see? Can’t you tell? Can’t you see how he done beat me unmerciful like I’m a dog? Can’t you see he trying to kill me? I hates to leave you, [MASK], but I gotta go.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Vyry	“Yes’m, she can,” and now [MASK] was twisting her apron in her hands, and her agitation must have been visible to her employer at this point. “Oh, I know, you want them to go to school, is that it?”
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Jim	Some of them made it to the Union lines. Some of them were destitute and suffering from exposure, privation, sickness, and hunger with no place to turn for help. [MASK] was forty years old. He doubted that he would make a soldier.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jim	If [MASK] had been a field hand, such a delicate conflict would not have disturbed him. He would have felt no ties to the Dutton household, but he had nursed the old man and he had watched the children grow.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Innis	She had finished selling her goods one afternoon and was walking toward the place where she always waited for [MASK] or he met her with the wagon. A group of white men and boys were standing on a corner laughing and talking among themselves.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnny	In the night she heard [MASK] coughing, and she got up and ran into his room. There, when she had made a light, she saw the blood streaming from his lips in great gulps every time the tearing cough would wrack his frame.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Grimes	Got to see that hound dog [MASK], too. He’s the banker now and there’s a big confusion over the Dutton property and affairs. The way I understand it, looks like he’s trying to take everything over.” “Is that so?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Smith	“I want to buy five thousand dollars’ worth of bonds, [MASK], and I also want to turn these other securities in the form of stocks and cotton investments to help the Confederacy in any way I can.”
<name>Yankees</name>	Yankees	Scripture	Much of what he heard startled him and he came up with strange conclusions. “Anything those southern rebels don’t like they declare on their sacred honor is wrong, and then they start hunting [MASK] to prove their interpretation is the only one that can be morally right.”
<name>No</name>	No	Nossah	“Well, it’s kinda hard to say. The doctor say she may be all right with rest, but I think it’s gonna be a long while.” “Then you won’t be moving on, soon?” “[MASK], I don’t hardly think so.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Johnny	After ten days they still had a third of the way to go and he felt [MASK] was weaker and getting a little feverish, but almost always after a good night’s rest he seemed better. “I gotta get him to his Maw fast.
<name>Massa</name>	Massa	Marster	A number of her fellow slaves were jumping the broom that Christmas. For them it was simple, so she reasoned. They were already slaves on [MASK]’s plantation or on his “other plantation” or from the plantations nearby, and their children were naturally doomed to be slaves.
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	Lawd	I done tried and tried. We is done been from pillar to post, and just when I thought we was bout to git us a home at last, they done burned all we got to the ground. Why, [MASK]? Just tell me, why?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Maw	But I can’t stay here no more, [MASK]. Don’t ask me to stay here. I’m big enough to work for myself if I’m big enough to work for him. And I knows one thing, I’m too big to take a beating.
<name>Dilsey</name>	Dilsey	Innis	All of the month of June the days were clear as glass and when the month of July set in with intense heat and sultriness they felt the relief of afternoon showers. “It’s dog-days now,” said [MASK], “it gwine rain some every day.”
<name>Paradise</name>	Paradise	Freedom	Once she dreamed she saw a beautiful door and she tried to enter it, because someone told her the name of the door was [MASK], but the door was locked and although she kept trying the lock and turning the golden knob, it would not open.
<name>Yassah</name>	Yassah	Jim	I can’t hardly remember him. I musta been real little.” “And your sister were a baby?” “Yassah, I reckon so.” [MASK] was sharing his fried chicken with his new friend, and the man ate awhile and said nothing.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Jim	It was hard to guess his age, whether he was twenty-five or thirty or somewhere in between, but he looked strong and husky and able to do a good day’s work. “I made friends with your little boy, here yestiddy,” and he patted [MASK]’s head.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Innis	Just make a mark right here.” “Yes sir.” And [MASK] made his mark. Oh, brother, I’m working in the high ground, Gwine to git to heaven by and by. 45 New land and higher ground the land was very bad.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Minna	[MASK] smiled when she saw it and said, “Maw, what is it?” “It’s a play-toy for you, honey, a baby doll. I ain’t never had no time to make you none before.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Vyry	“Well, [MASK], I keep forgetting that you’re half-white and you love white folks bettern you love colored folks.” “That’s a lie, and don’t you say no sitcha thing to me.” “I didn’t mean to make you mad.”
<name>She</name>	She	Minna	The little girl’s eyes would frequently tire and wander away, and now looking up she saw a man coming up the lane leading from the Big Road to their new farmhouse. [MASK] strained her eyes and looked again.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Vyry	At first [MASK] was tempted to bristle and get angry, but she controlled herself enough to listen. She could never learn through a better way how her prospective neighbors felt about her race. One day she stopped at a place where an old woman was sitting on a rickety porch.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marster	“Don’t feel like it, [MASK]. I ain’t in no shape for dancing.” “Why, what’s the trouble?” Her eyes were on the floor before her, and she did not look at him when he spoke.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Vyry	One morning, to her joyful surprise, she heard a “moo-moo” and there at the back door stood a lowing cow, a cow come fresh with a new calf though [MASK] did not see the calf and wondered where she was.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Gawd	and she nigh on to seven summers old. I got his youn-guns and I prays to [MASK] to see they daddy one more time in this life. I feels like something down deep inside of me would tell me was he dead.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Vyry	As they walked through the forest where they lived, the children picked flowers and [MASK] found her precious herbs and roots for teas and medi- cine, such as mullein, pine top, penny royal, and sheep sorrel in profusion.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Vyry	He worked hard for long hours and came home bringing first one trinket after another for [MASK] hoping thereby to brighten her eyes with a smile, but she remained dull and dour. She would reprove him for buying her anything, and say, “We ain’t got no money to waste on trifling things.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Lillian	She died up in the hills with her people, and looks like he felt it was good riddance of bad rubbish, he married again so soon.” “Wasn’t the Barrow girl one of [MASK]’s friends?” “Yes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vyry	“Well, how come they ain’t took the white mens?” M T „ V> Is you crazyr [MASK] went to the woman’s house later in the day to carry her some food and see how she was and she came home more agitated than ever.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Johnny	“My mother told me.” “And I roll bandages, and sew packets for the soldiers, and ...” Her voice trailed away and she fiddled with her riding crop, looking down at her hands. [MASK] waited.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Vyry	They had been completely successful in all their undertakings, bought matches and coffee and even white flour. They had sold eggs and vegetables and gotten their cotton ginned, and corn ground into meal. [MASK] bought peppermint and horehound candy and some whiskey and there had not been a minute’s trouble.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Vyry	The children were so excited in the release from confinement in the loft after three days and nights they scarcely wanted to come inside except to eat. [MASK] cautioned them, “Yall be careful, now, squishing your feets in all that muddy water.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jim	[MASK] could restrain himself no longer. The ten-year-old little boy grabbed his six-year-old sister and, lifting her in his arms, began to dance his jig and sing, You is free, you is free!
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Vyry	[MASK] set smudge pots in the backyard and on the front porch burning pungent green wood to drive away the insects but the low swampy ground and the open house with pigs and cows and horses all close to the houses only complicated their problems and made the summer misery one of heat and stench and insect bites.
<name>Arvin</name>	Arvin	Howdy	“[MASK] yourself. I’m a stranger man. I’m tired and I’m hungry and I’m looking for work. Where’s your father?” “Are you the same color all over?” “Are you?” “I guess.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Vyry	That’s the blackest man I ever did see in my life!” [MASK] looked up. She had just threaded her needle and had a snip of thread on her tongue. Now she made a knot and spit out the thread.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Turner	“But it was [MASK] who was the big man. He made the speech defending our right to be there because we were duly elected and all that, and he made the speech defending the black man to the white people, too.
<name>Joady</name>	Joady	Vyry	[MASK] said, “He didn’t say shares half and half, so we just don’t know.” “I don’t reckon he’d want more’n half of what we got.” “Well, we just don’t know, but don’t look like he would.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Meantimes	But I know with all this new trouble stirring up he’s bound to think it over. Said he’d think it over. [MASK], I want you to trust me ...” “Trust you how?” “Marry me. Marry me now.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Johnny	“Oh, [MASK], the war has spoiled everything! All our good times are gone and it’s so horribly lonesome!” She burst out with this abruptly, then covered her face with her hands, dropping the crop on the floor.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Shock	We’re going to buy things for my trousseau.” [MASK] wiped the smile off the doctor’s face and he glanced back at the boy whose grim unsmiling look told him how aware the boy was of his mother’s condition.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Johnny	Now what are you going to do?” [MASK] hastened to speak. “My mind is already made up. I would enlist immediately because I intend to fight for our Cause, but I’ve got to go back to school and get my commission first.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Vyry	[MASK] smiled understandingly and pocketed another dime. Then she wondered as she walked away, What kinda rights is us niggers got what we taken from the white folks ? But her worst experiences were overhearing two conversations that were so harrowing they left her feeling faint and ill.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Grimes	I happened to come by it honestly.” “Well, you’ve got a piece I want to buy.” “Where is it?” [MASK] went to the grist mill adjacent to the blacksmithy and he pointed diagonally across the railroad tracks to the land he had in mind.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Kevin	“My mind is already made up. I would enlist immediately because I intend to fight for our Cause, but I’ve got to go back to school and get my commission first. [MASK], what will you do?” “I honestly don’t know.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Shady	He didn’t want anybody treating him like dirt. But he did want to get into this war for freedom. “Halt! I say, who goes there?” “Open up, soldier, for [MASK]. I’m one of Old Ride-up’s Boys.”
<name>John</name>	John	Grimes	This only made one more headache for [MASK] in the summertime. Summer was always the busiest time of the year. The rain fell seldom; sometimes there was dry weather for two months, which meant more work days. Winter was always a dull time.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Innis	“And where was you when they was looking?” asked [MASK]. “You know the big wheel of the grist mill that stays partly under water so the water furnishes the power to turn the wheel and run the mill?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Vyry	He’s built like his mother and he never could swing that big hammer. I’m going to make a teacher out of him.” “A teacher?” blurted out [MASK]. “You means he can make a teacher?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lillian	[MASK] was diffident and fragile looking in her widow’s weeds. The black clothing and veil swathed her from head to toe and served to minimize her size and dwarf her personality while at the same time it heightened her blonde and porcelain beauty.
<name>John</name>	John	Grimes	To cap the climax, one morning he went outside his house and found one of the dogs digging after something under his steps. The dog howled and pawed frantically. [MASK] stood without speaking and watched the dog. Finally the dog found what he was seeking.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Innis	“You thinks education gwine raise up the colored folks?” asked [MASK]. “I always been told education don’t do nothing but make a nigger a fool.” “Well, that’s the white man’s attitude. He says an educated Ne-
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Vyry	“I heard about the fire in town and I came out to tell you how awfully sorry we are. My wife says if you want to come back, [MASK], she’d be glad to have you.”
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Vyry	“I don’t know, [MASK]. I just don’t know.” “She been through a whole lot, Doctor, a awful lot, losing all her close kinfolks one right after another, right close together.
<name>John</name>	John	Johnny	When the next day broke he was in the Hunt House, improvised as a hospital near the battlefield. That morning when [MASK] awoke he had a long wait before he saw the doctor for there were many hundreds of men in worse shape than he, and their improvised cots and litters were all over the place.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Vyry	“I ain’t asked them, but I reckon they would.” “ Wa-al you ask em to go, cause we might get lost or something.” “Ain’t no danger, [MASK], if that’s what you is scairt of.”
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Innis	[MASK] told her that the Government man said they must take possession of the land and begin to exercise squatters’ rights at once or it would have to go to someone else. They were not ready to build, but they had to move.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Vyry	[MASK] caught snatches of the long document as the man’s voice droned on, “Shall be... forever free” and she was caught up in a reverie hearing that magic word. Could it be possible that the golden door of freedom had at last swung open?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Willie	“Letter in this here pocket, and pass in this-a-one.” “Mind, you try to get back before dark.” “Yes’m.” [MASK] saw only one white man who stopped him, and he was a stranger.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Grimes	As fast as the fields were emptied and the ground permitted, [MASK] turned the men loose with the plows to turn up the corn stalks. While the harvesting continued they were already sowing the winter crops, and the work went along without a hitch.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Vyry	In the house [MASK] saw what damage the soldiers had done while she was frying all that chicken in the kitchen. She had not seen this part of the house since early morning when the man read the paper. Now she saw molasses all over the floor, walls dirtied, and chairs broken.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Vyry	But she had stumbled on through pain and sullenness. She had worked until she staggered, until her glassy eyes looked dull and witless and her shaking fingers steadied themselves under some strange rigid control from within. Never had [MASK] felt sorrier for anyone.
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Grimes	He vomited once and cried out during the night in his sleep. [MASK] looked up at the early morning sky where buzzards circled high above the trees, and he wished he were already home. The six slaves, all male, were naked to the waist.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Saddy	“He ain’t come lately, so I come to get you to write a letter.” “Why sho, child, what you want me to say?” “Just tell him I says to get a man to buy my time out, [MASK].”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jim	Although she moved about her usual tasks she felt mechanical. She acted from force of habit, but inside she was a sea of seething emotions. One of the concessions they had made to [MASK]’s growing up was a room of his own.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Hysterical	[MASK] now, she had thrown off piece after piece of her clothing, and now in the moonlight the two men stood horrified before the sight of her terribly scarred back. The scars were webbed and her back had ridges like a washboard.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Kevin	“He sure is an ugly man. But you know [MASK] has always said this war is going to be the end of slavery and all the niggers will be free when it’s over.” “Don’t tell me what your schoolteacher husband says.
<name>Toby</name>	Toby	Jim	Accompanied by [MASK], the houseboy, as his body-servant, he rode down through an avenue of live oaks to the old wagon road and cantered off to join the Confederate Army where he hoped to win the war.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vyry	She left her prissy mark on everybody around her, including [MASK]. That’s why she can’t stand bad language. And so far as education is concerned, I tell you it may not be the only way for our people but it is the main way.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Mammy	At first she wasn’t paying close attention, but something he said made her know he was talking about the war. “And when I heard tell how our folks was starving and [MASK] wasn’t gitting no greens and corn pone, I just quit the nigger-war and come home.”
<name>reckon</name>	reckon	Aggers	I don’t even believe he wants to.” “He might not want to, but she wants to.” “Oh.” “She been hating me ever since the day I was borned.” “I [MASK] since you has the younguns things is better for you.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Grimes	[MASK] was so disturbed that he blurted out his business in the full hearing of the house servants: “Niggers done broke open the smokehouse and steal the best meat and what they left, the field rats is covering up the damage.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Lawd	“You don’t care? You don’t care nothing bout him killing my sow what fixing to have pigs and all my money done gone down in that there mud?” “Killed the sow? [MASK], have mercy, is the sow dead?”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Hetta	Of course it was true there wasn’t anything too much she had to base her fear on. [MASK] was sick every day this last time. Toward the end she rarely left her bed. She was bloated and swollen beyond recognition.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Vyry	[MASK] decided that she wanted a house with four rooms and a wide hall through the center of the house. This wide center hall was really another big room with two rooms opening into it on each side. The front and back doors also opened into this hall, and there were front and back porches.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Grimes	Spring and fall were unpredictable insofar as weather was concerned; there were sometimes whole weeks when the slaves could not go into the fields, but this almost never happened in the summertime. [MASK] tried to harvest two crops before the summer was completely over.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Vyry	[MASK] was still weeping, but just as quickly as she had torn off her clothes she recovered herself and threw her apron around her shoulders to cover her back again and began to draw her skirts closer. Now she was drying her eyes and trying to compose herself.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Vyry	They never had clothes warm enough to keep out the wet cold. The field hands were worse off than the house servants. [MASK] was fortunate to be in the Big House, where the fires were burning in the iron grates and the kitchen was always a nice, comfortable place in winter.
<name>Alcey</name>	Alcey	Paw	“[MASK], I reckon you better make a fire out here and put my wash pot on with water to boil. We’s all could stand some washing up. I’ll try’n fix something to eat by the time you gits through feeding and milking.”
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Hetta	[MASK] was twenty-nine years old, although this was a fact she could not verify. After having given birth to fifteen children, all single births, she was waiting for death in childbed. Her thin bony fingers clutched nervously at the ragged quilt that covered her.
<name>His father</name>	His father	Innis	At Christmas he wanted more than anything else a real gun, a rifle that would shoot. [MASK] surprised him and said, “You and me ’ll hafta share it together,” when the boy happily turned over the twenty-two calibre rifle on Christmas morning.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jim	She grabbed the baby and told [MASK] to get up, too. He was so sleepy he could not move fast, but since he was already dressed in all his clothes she only paused long enough to wrap the baby again.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Willie	[MASK] put one piece of paper in one ragged pocket and the other piece in the other in order not to mix them, since he could not read what he carried. “Letter in this here pocket, and pass in this-a-one.”
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Vyry	The scorching and oppressive heat filled the house in the day and smothered them at night. [MASK] complained, “I ain’t never seen so many flies and skee- ters in all my born days. It looks like they’ll just take the place.”
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Vyry	What was even more aggravating they were always tracking in mud on their feet despite the folded croker sacks on the rickety front and back porches. They never seemed to hear [MASK]’s constant admonition, “Wipe your feets good fore you come in the house.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Vyry	They were sure, however, that eventually she would have her way. She had gone ahead with her plans for an auction on the place this Saturday and already this was the middle of the week. “What are you going to do?” they asked [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Johnny	I guess she’s all right, if you like her type.” “She’s sweet too.” [MASK] turned to look at his friend more closely. Then, a bit reluctantly, he said, “Yes, she does have a pretty even disposition.
<name>Lucynell</name>	Lucynell	Minna	One reason the man looked so strange to [MASK] was that he was not only black but he was dressed in black clothes and his clothes were unlike any she had ever seen a black man wear before. He didn’t have on work clothes or the cheap homespun that she knew.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fanny	She kept fluttering her eyelashes at you.” “Oh, [MASK]? We grew up together; when we were children I was always teasing her, pulling her hair, racing her on her pony, threatening to scare her or frightening her with the dogs.
<name>Brer</name>	Brer	Naw	Now you can put that in your pipe and smoke it whilst you is kivering your ground so big.” “Is you through?” “[MASK]. I just wants to let you know I knows what you been thinking.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Vyry	We’ve done everything we can for you, my husband and I.. “Yes’m, you sho is,” said [MASK] miserably trying to avoid a big misunderstanding by interrupting, “and we appreciates it, ma’am, we does.”
<name>Massa</name>	Massa	Grimes	He led her to the whipping post not far from the wet fields where the field hands were not working this morning because the ground was too wet. Two of [MASK]’s men tied her hands together as if she were folding them to pray, and then stretched them high above her head.
