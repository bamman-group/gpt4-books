<name>Babe</name>	Babe	Sue	[MASK] wore a large straw hat with a rhinestone dagger stuck through it with careless grace. Her coat had a huge imitation fur collar. The coat fitted closely at the waist and flared generously at the bottom. There was more fur at the bottom and fur at the cuffs.
<name>he</name>	he	Dot	She looked a little bored vith life and had none of the shining mysticism of a girl n her last month of single blessedness. She chuckled when [MASK] told her news. “Good for you,” she cried. “Good!”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Dot	[MASK] felt that she had been walking for eternities down a narrow, dimly-lit corridor with the angel of death beckoning her on. She remembered the day that the world had reeled and everything had gone black before her eyes. She must reach the nursery.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Dot	[MASK] was miserably undecided about the matter. One ought to go home if one was going to be ill, but it was a terribly long ride, and subways and street cars are awful places to be ill in. Still, a party is no place for such things.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Eddie	She took off her coat and laid it over the iron foot of the bed. Her hat she perched on [MASK]’s clothes-tree, and he smiled at seeing it there. It looked funny as hell, he said to her.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Dot	The doctor put an arm around her for assistance and captured a breast in one of his hands as he did so. “This is a good time to be indiscreet,” he suggested. [MASK] reached for her chemise and dress, and the doctor instantly became professional.
<name>they</name>	they	Eddie	“Yeh, sure, I’ll be only a short car ride away.” “No, I mean it.” “So do I mean it. If I’m there how can [MASK] call me an interfering, God damn pest?”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Dot	The kitchen was of course much smaller than the living-room. [MASK] liked a small kitchen. It saves a great many steps, and this one had the advantage of opening right out from the living-room. There was a swinging door between.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Sue	“But didn’t anything happen? Didn’t he try to go iretty far with you ?” “Well, you damn little fool,” said [MASK]. “Where have rou been? Of course he tried to go pretty far with me ind succeeded.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dot	Silly, of course, but the impression persisted. The nurse came in with a baby in her arms. She walked to [MASK]’s bed with it. “Isn’t this a cute one?” she asked.
<name>George</name>	George	Dot	“Well, he might,” she said, “but don’t die if he says no.” “Three rooms would be plenty,” said [MASK]. “A bedroom, living-room, and kitchen. I couldn’t go over fifty a month though.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Mommie	“Baby, wake up. [MASK]’s alone and scared. Baby, baby, darling, wake up. They say you can’t see or hear much at first, but you must hear me now. Baby, wake up.” The baby did not move.
<name>away</name>	away	Dot	Over and over they reminded the woman that she had dreamed for nine months of her baby, had suffered for him, and now she did not have him. And one of them was a man! When they had gone [MASK] lay with clenched fists listening to the dry sobs that came from the other bed.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Maude	She’s sick and has sent her kid down here for us to mind. I was playing with her when you came in.” “Funny to think of you playing with a kid.” “Oh, I’m good at it,” said [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dot	The room on the other side of the door was not the hideous room with the “table” as [MASK] had expected. There was a door, however, in the west wall, which was certainly concealing the chamber of horrors.
<name>her</name>	her	Dot	She turned again to feast her eyes upon the tiny mortal. He was so sweet, so adorable, so— Suddenly the blood in [MASK]’s veins turned to ice water. A sharp prickling sensation ran up her back. The baby was dribbling.
<name>the fire</name>	the fire	Dot	He sat down on the edge of the chair and tried to keep his eyes fixed on [MASK]. The two other women, so much at ease in their nightgowns, so unaffected by the presence of a male stranger, confused him.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Dot	It belonged to the house, of course, and [MASK] tried not to think that she might some day move away from it. It was a white bowl supported by a thick brass chain and nicely finished off with a row of white glass lace.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Bernstein	The song proved a foolish move on his part, for it reminded six or seven other guests of their own accomplishments. One, a chap named [MASK], with a remarkable Jewish accent, thought of his customary contribution to things of this sort before anybody else did.
<name>The enemy</name>	The enemy	Eddie	They could joke about it. What did they know of the suspense, the worry, the discomfort, all borne through blinding hot days and nights of close, stifling darkness? [MASK] was no ally. He did not seem particularly anxious to have it over with.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sue	With the couples who were leaning against the walls in the hall she had no argument. But it wasn’t nice to go hide where nobody could see you at your deviltry. She took the matter up with [MASK].
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Eddie	And funny that somehow she didn’t care for herself. But to 185 leave a tiny, defenseless baby all alone in the big world! There was [MASK], of course, but he would be bewildered, frightened, helpless as the baby. What would he do?
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Dot	It’ll only take a minute. I think I’ll phone the rooming-house. I don’t think he went to work today and he’s probably waiting for a call.” [MASK] went then, singing as she walked down the hall:
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Dot	[MASK], I’m a wreck. You see, I ain’t used to stopping. Do you get what I mean?” “Yes, I get it.” “Well, it looks like a kiss or so is all you want out of this thing.
<name>it</name>	it	Judge	She discarded her hat and cape and picked up a magazine. It was the Atlantic Monthly. She didn’t remember ever having seen a copy of the Atlantic Monthly before. It looked like a very nice magazine, but [MASK] had funny pictures.
<name>He</name>	He	Dot	He closed the door and turned on the lights. [MASK] looked about and gathered an impression of a tiny room, a narrow white bed, a chiffonier, and radio parts that trailed their disks, coils, and plates over every visible flat surface.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dot	To [MASK] there was something touching about that white spread. It seemed so wistfully envious of the beautiful pink curtains, so sure that no one could ever admire it while the breezes insisted upon making lovely, delicate sails out of the pink voile curtains.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Dot	“Well, then that’s settled,” [MASK] said briskly. She moved up another step and delayed going farther. Her hands drifted lingeringly over the balustrade, and one foot made strange little jerky motions expressive of indecision. “I got to go up now,” she said.
<name>the patient</name>	the patient	Dot	There were apparently a great many things they had to do to her. They moved about busily, preparing her for the operating table. There was enmity between the two nurses, obvious even to [MASK], who was not in a particularly observant mood.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dot	These looked right smack across twenty-five feet into somebody else’s bedroom, but [MASK] didn’t look, except straight down with her head to the left side, and then she could see the street again just as she did from the living-room.
<name>Dr. Nolan</name>	Dr. Nolan	Edna	She was not anxious to debate the pro and con of birth control. She perceived instantly that the kind of help that she wanted would not be forthcoming from this quarter, and she was ready to let the matter drop. “How do you feel ?” [MASK] asked after a time.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Eddie	They wouldn’t be ready in time. [MASK] would wash them, she knew, but he wouldn’t be able to iron them. The other items included a kimono, bedroom slippers, brush, soap, washcloth, toothbrush, tooth paste, talcum powder, and two towels.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Dot	[MASK] said nothing. Her head was resting against the balustrade bars, and her pleated skirt lay in soft folds on the bottom step. The front door slammed, and a woman of thirty or thereabouts with keen brown eyes and a fine figure came into the foyer.
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Gee	[MASK], from the back you’d never know she was pregnant! She wore a short dotted-swiss dress without sleeves and without belt or sash. It had only taken an hour to make and had cost but forty-nine cents.
<name>Slim</name>	Slim	Eddie	“She won’t tell my brother. She says you can’t watch a girl hard enough to keep her good, if she don’t want to be.” [MASK] nodded gravely. That sounded like brilliant summing up of a situation to him.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Dot	Curious indeed is the hankering of the uptown tradesman to strew the path of his customer with gems of philosophical wisdom. [MASK] was already seated in the back at one of the tables. She had unbuttoned her coat and v as gnawing thoughtfully at a thumb nail.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Dot	Sleep well.” [MASK] heard them descending the stairs. Funny the stairs weren’t carpeted. You’d think in a place like this where there were so many sick people that they’d have carpet. . . .
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Dot	“It may be that I love him too much to wait.” “I know all those stalls, too. Well, are you going to have him call here and give me time to look him over ?” [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Kid</name>	Kid	Eddie	These things knew her, and she had to leave them. She had to go away. “Ready, Kid?” [MASK] came into the living-room and put his arm around her. “Yes, I’m ready.” They walked down the stairs very slowly.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Dot	He had a Motion Picture Magazine, a copy of Love Stories, and a Daily News. “Almost time for the kid to be brought?” he asked. “I guess so,” said [MASK]. “Did he eat today?”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Eddie	[MASK] walked out of the room. He stood in the hall for a minute looking down at the baby. Then he kissed him. Could you squeeze them while they were so young? Well, maybe a little bit.
<name>Mrs. Jones</name>	Mrs. Jones	Eddie	Would he perhaps make her slap the poor little thing? He had to be told. Soon he might find out for himself, and then it would be worse. “[MASK], let me take the baby. He’s—he’s dribbling on the sleeve of your new blue suit!”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Edna	[MASK] watched her from the bed and kept up a rapid flow of disgusted comments. “Say, are you dying? Come on. You don’t have to sew that ribbon now. Turn out the light, will you? I’m sleepy.
<name>him</name>	him	Eddie	Maybe she wantec a baby. Cute damn things. Once a baby in a bakery hac got so that she knew [MASK] and had quite unexpected^ made him a present of her rattle. It had been a pink rabbit with little pebbles inside.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Dot	“For how long?” “Two weeks. We’ll get you home after that.” [MASK]’s face betrayed her dismay. A hundred and twenty-five dollars for the sanitarium and two hundred for the doctor. Could they manage?
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Dot	Still she had to know why he hadn’t come. Perhaps she could find the girl who whistled and wore a bright blue slicker. [MASK] climbed the stairs and looked around. Five doors. All closed. No sound from anywhere.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Edna	It was funny and kind of sweet to think of them walking down the street together. What would they talk about? They both kissed her. [MASK] bent over the baby and kissed his fingers and murmured silly, soft things in his ear.
<name>He</name>	He	Eddie	“Oh, I’m going to have it,” she said, hastily, “but I just wanted you to know that I feel just as you feel. I don’t want it either.” [MASK] scowled but said nothing.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Eddie	“Aw, she makes me sick,” said [MASK]. “She thinks she’s so God damned important.” “Well, she was pretty important last night. What would I have done without her? My brother kicked me out.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Dot	“I don’t know what you call it,” he said carelessly. She opened it. A tiny crocheted sacque lay within carefully wrapped in tissue paper. A large blue bow of very stiff, aggressive ribbon was at the neck of it. [MASK] smiled.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Eddie	The wrap stirred languidly, a trifle impatiently, and slipped from [MASK]’s disinterested hold. It lay on the deck of the Burma, an aromatic heap of silk. A wrap with a Lanvin green lining that was splotchy and torn but still defiantly Lanvin green.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dot	“I ain’t always laughing,” said [MASK]. “I ain’t got so much to laugh about. What do you think about getting a doctor ?” “Sure, get one. If everybody else has them, I suppose you ought to.”
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Dot	“A girl is i damn fool who holds back.” “Why do you think that?” “Gee, [MASK], you know yourself how you get loving, rhere’s damn little a fellow don’t know about you before ,-ou say yes.
<name>fake</name>	fake	Dottie	Then, having been assured that it was, he would nod contentedly and return to his reading. He had known all along that it was [MASK], but it was part of the game that she should say so.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dot	She wanted to go for a sail so I took her. She met somebody she knew on the boat and canned me.” He smiled ruefully. “Didn’t even know her name,” he added. “What’s yours?” “[MASK].”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Dot	“He’ll probably think it’s a good joke about your friend pretending you had a toothache.” [MASK] sat down and began to pull on her stockings. If you rush downtown every morning at eight o’clock, you haven’t the daily bath habit.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Dot	[MASK] studied the carpet, and in the silence that followed she added, “You don’t know that I’ve done anything wrong.” “Don’t I? Say, I wasn’t born yesterday. You ain’t the 60 strong, determined kind of girl.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Dot	One wonders who buys the pajamas that are sold uptown. [MASK]’s disrobing was done in a more leisurely fashion, and it bore a slight tint of elegance. She cold-creamed her face before retiring. She wore a nightgown. There were bedroom slippers at her side of the bed.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eddie	“Oh, my brother isn’t after her money. He gets seventy-five dollars a week himself. He won’t let me put a penny in the house. Some brother I got.” “I’ll say,” [MASK] agreed.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Dot	Well, there’ll be no shows and dances with a wee one to mind, and the money’ll go on him. So there you are. What are you going to name it?” [MASK] shook her head slowly. Wee one. What a cute expression.
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Eddie	“Do you know her?” “No, but when a woman hollers down a stairs like that, it’s ’cause she don’t care what the neighbors think, and she gets like that when nothing counts any more.” “You’re crazy,” [MASK] said.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Eddie	He meant it. “Well, I just thought I’d try to think up some girl I used to know and tell her I was married and about my apartment and all.” “Oh,” said [MASK], “I see.
<name>hungry</name>	hungry	Dot	“Hello, Kid, how are you?” “Fine. Are you at work?” “Yes. I was dead for sleep, [MASK], and I got up late and had to rush right to the shop.” “That’s all right.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Dot	A dazzling bright shaft of moonlight fell across the shirtwaist box. [MASK] stared at it silently, admiring it. How pretty it was. Things like this could make her forget for the moment how great a trial this waiting was.
<name>they</name>	they	Williams	She depended on forty dollars a week. Suppose he wasn’t so good at the job, suppose he was a guy [MASK] could can without missing, suppose he couldn’t connect with another job fast. She’d have to have the kid brought by charity doctors.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddie	When the whistling, humming herd was no longer whistling and humming “It Ain’t Gonna Rain No More.” She drew herself away from [MASK] and faced the stairs again. Kisses were different here with the fading rug and the unhappy chairs looking on in silent, shocked amazement.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Eddie	“Yes, but he ain’t seen me lately. Maybe something has happened.” “Oh, go on,” said [MASK]. “Nothing just happens. You’d ’a’ felt it, I’ll bet, if anything bad had happened.”
<name>resemble</name>	resemble	Dot	Much as all Martians would look alike to us till we grew accustomed to any strange physical features they might have, so did all members of the tribe who never appear self-conscious and who are careless about the impression they leave seemed to [MASK] to be cut from two standard models.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Dot	“He feels much cooler and he’s sleeping nicely.” “Bring him in here.” “I will not.” “Just carry him in and let me look at him. You don’t have to leave him a second,” [MASK] begged.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dot	“Yeh,” said [MASK] bitterly. “Last night.” “Oh, you’re one of those trusting girls, eh? When you can see everything you believe it, but if the light goes out for a second you begin to doubt.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Dot	Why?” CHAPTER XXII It was over now—the months of waiting, the pain, the fear that the baby would die, the two weeks at the sanitarium. It was all over, or practically so. This was [MASK]’s last night away from home.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Eddie	“But maybe [MASK] wouldn’t come. Wait, I’ll ask him.” He was leaning up against the door at the top of the restaurant stairs. His hat was on his head, and his cigarette burned close to his fingers.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Dot	He pulled her down on his knee and kissed her. [MASK] laughed and scrambled to her feet. “Oh, that’s what you wanted! Gee, I thought you had something important to say or something. If I had known I wouldn’t have come.”
<name>him</name>	him	Eddie	It tore. It cut. Perhaps she was going far away and was going to leave [MASK] wondering what to do. She crept closer to him over the dead, black roof. His face was a blur of white in the darkness.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Dot	Hospitals were the only places where that was done, and she never expected to enter another. [MASK] went to the bathroom and washed her face and hands. She brushed her teeth and combed her hair. Tomorrow night she would be doing this in her own bathroom !
<name>his mother</name>	his mother	Eddie	He was frightened, perhaps. And he would die. Those tiny fingers with the tiny pink nails wouldn’t clutch [MASK]’s finger any more. That little, well-shaped head with its cap of sunny hair wouldn’t lie against her breast.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	“I don’t want to be bad friends with [MASK]. He likes me in his own way. You’ll hit him, and whether he clouts the devil out of you or you lick him, he’ll throw me out anyway.”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Eddie	Then she smiled. A radio set. Probably [MASK]’s set, too. She was trying to place the room from which the music came when it was discontinued as suddenly as it had started. A second later it began again, loud but not clear as before.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Dot	48 “I’m not sore at you. You’re right. I’m a coocoo.” He walked to the window and stared vacantly for a second before saying “Look,” in a low, disgusted tone. [MASK] looked.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Eddie	I’m getting crazy from just looking at this room.” [MASK] turned off the radio. “I’ll go with you,” he said. They ascended the one short flight of stairs to the roof in silence.
<name>she</name>	she	Dot	“It’s in its n4 second month. Give me a ring and make an appointment if you decide to have an operation. Bring your husband or a friend with you.” He retreated into the other room, and [MASK] hurried into her hat and coat.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Eddie	[MASK] would be home then, and in case success was in store for her she wanted him near. At nine in the morning she took the cupful of thick, bloodlike fluid. Lacto pepsin was a familiar shade of red, and it created a horrible illusion.
<name>He</name>	He	Eddie	She had pictured him soft and pink in her arms, drawing astonished glances from the other passengers. “You didn’t forget about him,” she challenged. [MASK] looked at her in amazement. Was she jealous that he had thought of the baby’s discomfort and had treated hers lightly?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Eddie	It was impossible to guess at the color of his eyes because he kept blinking them continually. He sat down near [MASK]. They felt kindly toward each other, but neither knew why, nor were they conscious of a bond. Cocktails were not mentioned to the newcomers.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Dot	[MASK] looked at the sky. The stars and the moon seemed to be permanently fixed. There was not the slightest sign of their rushing away from the rosy streaks of morning. It was two o’clock, perhaps. Maybe only one. Dawn. Dawn.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Dot	“Yes, I get it.” “Well, it looks like a kiss or so is all you want out of this thing. You’re not upset if we stop after hot loving.” “Is that so?” asked [MASK], unexpectedly.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Dot	He said he felt sure his boss would advance him fifty dollars and that he could repay him five dollars a week. [MASK] closed her eyes wearily. One had one’s choice be-116 tween going to that dirty office and being mercilessly pawed or submitting to the unbearable pain of childbirth.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Dot	[MASK] would stand on the little blue bath mat and stud; the gleaming white tiles surrounding it. And sometime she would suddenly burst into song, and other times sh felt as though she’d just like to cry. CHAPTER X
<name>George</name>	George	Eddie	“Oh, I’m sick. I’m sick. This heat! Oh, it’s terrible!” [MASK] leaped from his chair. “Ought I get the doctor ?” “No, I’m all right. I’m just warm. Just awful warm.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Eddie	“I gotta get my hair cut,” she remarked, “as soon as I think I can sit long enough in a barber’s chair without getting sick.” “Why don’t you wait till the day before Christmas Eve?” said [MASK].
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Eddie	” If the mention of the single bed was out of order, nobody noticed it, and [MASK] continued. “My landlady didn’t have a double room; so I moved across the street. She was mad, that’s why she didn’t tell you.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Eddie	He wanted to do it all, and if she couldn’t see for herself that he was willing, then she was too dumb to worry about; so [MASK] sprinkled soap flakes in the dishpan and scowled. After dinner they went back to the living-room.
<name>Miss Baker</name>	Miss Baker	Dot	“Oh, I’ve been working,” [MASK] responded. “That’s about all I ever do.” “You poor thing. I simply couldn’t stand an office routine. I nearly went mad rushing downtown every day.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Eddie	“But, [MASK], three hundred and twenty-five dollars! Almost enough to buy a Ford car.” “Sooner have the Ford, heh?” “No, I didn’t mean that exactly, but it’s so much money.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dot	“He’s got a little fever, but that’s natural from not eating. It’s nothing to worry about.” “No?” asked [MASK]. “Well, we’ll worry about it anyhow. That’s being on the safe side.”
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Dot	Funny, how bewildered and frightened he would have looked had she asked him to get her pink dress off the hook and bring it along. [MASK] got into her clothes. She made up her face very carefully. She wanted to look nice despite the terrible dress which hung so disgracefully upon her.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Edna	“Sure you would,” [MASK] agreed. “All any bride needs is a can opener.” “Oh, I mean really cook, pot roasts and things.” There was something very touching in the way she said pot roasts and things.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Eddie	She couldn’t trust herself to speak of the baby. She couldn’t tell [MASK], anyhow, of the hour she had spent whispering pleas and promises into those tiny pink ears that might well have been the rose petals they resembled for all the good it did to implore.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eddie	She knew she ought to. She knew she ought to. Another kiss, hot and heedless, made her breath come faster. She saw [MASK]’s eyes blue and narrow close to her, a vein in his temple throbbing spasmodically. He closed his eyes.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Dot	“Well, we’ll worry about it anyhow. That’s being on the safe side.” “You’ll spoil your milk, worrying.” “You haven’t got any milk; so you worry,” said [MASK].
