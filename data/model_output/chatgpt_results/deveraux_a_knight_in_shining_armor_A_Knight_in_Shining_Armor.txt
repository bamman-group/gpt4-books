<name>she</name>	she	Dougless	She wanted to say more, wanted to say something that would make him give up the idea of returning, but she knew there were no words that could change his mind. His family, his name, and his honor were very important to him. “We’ll leave today,” [MASK] said softly.
<name>Catelyn</name>	Catelyn	Kit	“This is a fine way to treat a man back from the dead,” [MASK] managed to croak out. “My brother bleeds on me, and a pretty woman sheds tears. Is no one glad that I yet live?”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Dougless	“Is this your friend?” “I’m merely his secretary,” [MASK] said, rising. “Will there be anything else, my lord?” “Lord?!” the young woman gasped. “You’re a lord?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nicholas	[MASK]’s eyes were as wide as dinner plates. Turning, he pointed at the books, then opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. “Come on,” she said, smiling, as she pulled him inside.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Puzzled	I never want to see your tomb again.” Still smiling at her, he started to take a step, but his body didn’t move. [MASK], he looked down at his feet. From his knees down, there was nothing, merely space.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Dougless	Neither of us had any idea that you’d decide to remain here, or that you’d refuse to travel with us. Isn’t that right, sweetheart?” “Helping me?” [MASK] gasped, so overwhelmed with his twisting of the truth that she could hardly speak.
<name>She</name>	She	Dougless	[MASK] didn’t want to tell anyone what had happened to her. But her need to share was greater than her pride, and within minutes, she was pouring out her story to him. “This man left you alone? Unattended?”
<name>John</name>	John	Nicholas	Madam, you are not wanted here.” She was standing over him, looking down at him and trying to think of what to say to make him listen to her. Then, as she watched, in his anger [MASK] snatched up the calculator and began punching the buttons.
<name>she</name>	she	Dougless	His first sight of the lover who had abandoned her was such a shock to him that he’d had difficulty understanding the words. At first his only thought had been that [MASK] was going to leave him. How would he find the key to returning if she left him?
<name>Grimsby</name>	Grimsby	Nicholas	“You! Go!” she said to the physician, and he backed out of the room. “[MASK], take her, feed her, dry her, clothe her, and bring her to me on the morrow. Early.” “I?”
<name>he</name>	he	Dougless	He was insatiable in his curiosity, and he asked questions faster than [MASK] could answer them. When she couldn’t find pictures to show him, she pulled out a spiral notebook, colored felt-tips, and began to draw. The pens and paper caused more questions.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Dougless	“And hungry, too, is my guess.” Taking her arm firmly in his, he shouldered her bag. “There’s a pub around the corner. Let’s get something to eat.” [MASK] allowed him to lead her down the street.
<name>Americans</name>	Americans	Americans	“It’s not like that now. It’s—” She stopped talking when the waitress put their sandwiches before them. But they were not sandwiches as [MASK] know them. An English cheese sandwich was a piece of cheese on two pieces of buttered white bread.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Nicholas	Now he was truly hers, she thought, hers to touch whenever she wanted. Holding his hand, she pressed her body against his and put her head in the crook of his shoulder. “[MASK],” she whispered. “I love you so much.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Dougless	Slowly, [MASK] walked toward the window, then back. The clothes were ridiculous, of course. They were heavy, unwieldy, terrible for your lungs, and yet . . . She put her hands to her waist. She could practically encircle it with her hands.
<name>pregnant</name>	pregnant	Lettice	Get [MASK] with child, then go to your Montgomery woman. It was an arrangement my second husband had, and I did not mind. Although he gave his woman three children and me only one and that one died,” she added bitterly.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Nicholas	Flipping up his loupe, the man went to his knees and examined the embroidery on the garter about [MASK]’s knee, then looked at the knitting of his hose, and, last of all, at his soft slippers.
<name>Lord Canterville</name>	Lord Canterville	Lee	He chuckled in a fatherly way. “Please, call me [MASK]. It has been rather exciting, although I’m just now getting into the papers.” “They’re all about some man who was about to be beheaded, aren’t they?
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Nicholas	The ground under her was getting wet, and she thought of sitting on a magazine, but who knows? She might end up selling the magazines in order to live. She put her head down on her knees. “Oh, [MASK], where are you?”
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Lee	She asked a passing servant where [MASK] was, but was told that he was locked in his room with the letters and had left instructions that he was not to be disturbed. “But he left a book for you in the library,” the servant said.
<name>her</name>	her	Dougless	“Me?” She pulled away from him. “Me?” “Aye. You shall stay in my household.” He gave her a look through his lashes. “You shall attend to my wife.” It took [MASK] a moment to react.
<name>him</name>	him	Robert	At the moment she didn’t think she could handle a confrontation. She hardly looked at [MASK]. “I’ll get the bracelet,” she said, then turned away before he could speak. Catching her arm, he halted her.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Kit	I’ve been sent back to warn you, but unless you listen to me, everything’s going to happen the same way it did before. [MASK] will—” He stood up, cutting her off, then leaned over her threateningly.
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Dougless	“Who are we to be any different?” she mocked in a falsetto voice as she paid the cab driver. It didn’t take [MASK] five minutes to learn that she was not considered a houseguest but a servant, and not a very welcome one at that.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Kit	One advantage women throughout time have had is that the little boy in men always remembers a time when women were all-powerful. The men bumped into each other as they ran to do her bidding. “You have a shrew on your hands, brother,” [MASK] said happily.
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Dougless	“Yes,” [MASK] whispered. “We have touched.” They were alone on the bed, the room dark except for the golden glow of three candles. “If we have touched, then it will not matter if we touch again in this life.”
<name>Godric</name>	Godric	Nicholas	Yet, for all that she had brought him forward, she did not seem to have a use for him. Perhaps, [MASK] thought, she had not meant to call him forth. Perhaps she had great power, but knew not how to use it.
<name>Dougless</name>	Dougless	Lettice	[MASK], perhaps, was more perfect-featured, but this woman, this Dougless, who enraged him, had something more, something he could not name. From the first moment he’d seen her, it had been as though she had some secret hold over him.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Dougless	It didn’t seem to smell much better inside than out. “Hello? Is anybody home?” No one answered, but [MASK] felt as though she were being watched. When she turned, she saw three women and a couple of children behind her.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Nicholas	The old church was open and empty, and [MASK] led her to sit on a pew that was at a right angle to the tomb. In silence, she watched him as he looked at the marble sculpture for a while, then ran his hands over the date and name.
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	Kit	But then the images came again, this time in the form of dreams. “You must tell me if [MASK] has shown you the door,” he heard the woman saying. “Tell me if you cut your arm.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nicholas	As he watched, the door seemed to fall away, and with it went the room. For a moment [MASK] appeared to be standing on nothing. There was a void around him, his body naught but a shadow through which he could see the darkness of nothing.
<name>He</name>	He	Nicholas	Her arms felt as if they were lengthening from carrying the heavy bags. But [MASK] had stopped again, this time in front of a women’s clothing store. “You will purchase yourself new clothing,” he said, and it was an order.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Dougless	[MASK] whispered, holding the thing up to look at it. The corset was made of thin, flexible strips of steel, covered with fine silk, with steel hooks down one side, and since the corset wasn’t new, rust was showing through the silk.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Robert	At least with [MASK] I was his only woman. But you . . . you’re asking me to wait on that. . . that killer! What am I supposed to do at night while you’re trying to produce an heir with her?”
<name>Miss Moneypenny</name>	Miss Moneypenny	Dougless	“Uh-oh,” [MASK] said innocently. “Was I disturbing the two of you? I’m so awfully sorry. I didn’t mean to. I was just doing my job.” She started backing toward the door.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Nicholas	She would call the airlines and see if she could get a flight home immediately. Perhaps if she returned to familiar surroundings, she could begin to forgive herself. As she walked, she went past the church that contained [MASK]’s tomb and her feet seemed to turn toward the gate of their own accord.
<name>he</name>	he	Nicholas	When he moved his hand from her chin, he found that it was trembling. He felt like a boy with his first woman. Except that the first time [MASK] had bedded a woman, he had been eager and enthusiastic, not trembling as he was now.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Dougless	[MASK] hung up, then slumped against the telephone cubicle. Now what do I do? she thought. “What is this?” the man asked, looking at the telephone with great interest. “You talked to this?” “Give me a break, will you?”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Nicholas	Reaching out, she put her hand on his arm. “[MASK], I know I must seem strange to you, but if you’d just listen to me and let me explain—” “Nay,” he said, moving away from her touch.
<name>Outlander</name>	Outlander	Nicholas	When [MASK] recovered himself, he looked down at her, amused. “We have arrived,” he said. “Where? Are there cars outside or donkey carts?” Chuckling, he lifted her face in his hands. “We remain in your time.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Dougless	It was never finished because you . . . you ...” “Were executed,” he said, and for the first time he really thought about her words. “I wish you to tell me all.” “From the beginning?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Sir Gawain</name>	Sir Gawain	Nicholas	What did—” [MASK] sat up and kissed her mouth most sweetly. “You cannot return with me.” He put his hand to his back. “You are hard on my armor. There are scratches from when you last struck me down.”
<name>she</name>	she	Dougless	That luggage is quite expensive.” “I am aware of that,” [MASK] said, trying to keep the anger out of her voice. “It’s just that I’m having a difficult time sitting back here. There isn’t much room.”
<name>Julius</name>	Julius	Dougless	[MASK] asked. “Being the boss carries a burden to it.” He gave her a look of anger. “You believe your history books. Come,” he said, “you must read more. You must discover who betrayed me.”
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Gloria	“Look,” he said as he smiled at her, “we didn’t come here to quarrel. [MASK] and I have missed you.” He gave a little laugh. “Oh, you should see us. We get lost every few minutes.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Nicholas	She told of his walking in front of a bus. She didn’t get far after that because [MASK] started asking questions. It seemed he’d had a vision of her on a two-wheeled vehicle and he wanted her to explain what it was.
<name>he</name>	he	Nicholas	Annoyed, he got up from the crude little table and looked out the tiny open window to the courtyard below. There were four men walking about, but there was no woman. Besides, [MASK] was three stories up, so he could not have heard her.
<name>she</name>	she	Dougless	This was no pretty room filled with treasures. It was a cell with one tiny window high up on the wall, and little more than a lumpy mattress in a corner, with a filthy wool blanket on top. “I can’t stay here,” [MASK] said, horrified.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Nicholas	I’ve told you that a thousand times. All I’ve done is what I’ve had to do to get myself inside your house so I can warn you.” Standing up, she tried to calm herself. “[MASK], we have to stop arguing.
<name>the tour guide</name>	the tour guide	Nicholas	As calmly as she could, she carried the tote bag and the flashlight to the register, where she paid for them and tickets for the next tour. She tried again to look at the postcards, but [MASK] would not let her.
<name>her</name>	her	Dougless	He stroked her hair. “I will not leave you,” he said softly. “I will remain with you for always.” It took a moment for his words to reach [MASK]. She lifted up to look at him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Montgomery	“[MASK], do you fall in love with me again?” he asked, smiling at her. “Come, we will take these letters to my bedchamber. I will let you make love to me.”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Nicholas	Being in the hotel kitchen when she knew they shouldn’t be added excitement to this most wonderful night. She looked at the back of [MASK] as he opened a refrigerator door (and felt a little pang that he had learned of refrigerators from someone other than her).
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Nicholas	How was she going to make him listen? They went upstairs to the top floor, and [MASK] threw open a door. “You sleep here.” She stepped inside. This was no pretty room filled with treasures.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Smiling	“You’re to leave this room while I take a bath.” [MASK], he set her down and looked about. “What manner of room is this?” “It’s the bathroom.” “I see the bathing pot, but what is this object?
<name>Dr. John Thorpe</name>	Dr. John Thorpe	Kit	The legs are turned in a spiral.” [MASK] smiled at the urgency in her voice—and at the wild look of her. Her face was running with perspiration, her cap was half off, and her auburn hair was faking about her shoulders.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	James	Wrap the miniature and put it behind the corbel. When I . . . when I return, I’ll go get it.” He was kissing her breast. “Did you hear me?” “I heard all. [MASK].
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Dougless	Count to ten, [MASK] thought, or better yet, twenty. She drew a deep breath. “I do not get my kicks from watching you make a fool of yourself with women,” she said calmly. “I’ve told you why I’m here.
<name>her</name>	her	Dougless	She mounted her sedate mare and followed him as he took off. Never had she seen a happier man, and it struck [MASK] afresh how different the modern world must be from what he knew. He and the horse fit together as one being, as though he’d become a centaur.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Nicholas	Standing in the doorway, she saw [MASK] looking about the room, sadness in his eyes. “This was my brother’s chamber, and I was here but a fortnight ago,” he said softly, then shrugged as though to block the regret from his mind.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Nicholas	The room was dark, but she could see the outline of the bed—the bed she was to share with [MASK]. Slowly, she walked toward the bed. She could see the long shape of his body under the covers, and she reached out her hand to touch him.
<name>him</name>	him	Kit	Now, what you want is for [MASK] to notice you, and what you need is a little self-confidence. You also need to trust your own judgment and not someone else’s. So maybe we can accomplish a few of these things by putting on a show.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Dougless	“But you never mentioned a wife,” she said softly. “Not once have you referred to her.” “I would be a poor husband to profane my beloved’s name to my servant. “Servant,” [MASK] whispered.
<name>Brienne</name>	Brienne	Nicholas	Slowly, without a word, the man came forward and began to walk around [MASK], examining his clothing. After one circuit, he dropped the jeweler’s loupe down over his eye and looked at the armor, murmuring, “Mmm hmm,” over and over.
<name>her</name>	her	Dougless	He was on her, his mouth and hands everywhere, as she kissed whatever part of him came near her mouth. His hands tore at her gown and [MASK] heard it ripping away. When his hot, wet mouth fastened onto her breast, she moaned in ecstasy.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Dougless	Just a month ago he had been here, and then it had been new and perfect. Now the chimney pots were crumbling, there were broken places along the roof, and some of his windows had been bricked in. “It’s beautiful,” [MASK] whispered, then straightened, “sir.”
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Dougless	[MASK] stood up, her fists clenched at her side. Damn him, she thought. This is just the sort of thing that had gained him such an awful reputation in the twentieth century. No wonder the history books had nothing good to say about him.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Dougless	Animals, people, rotting food, piles of manure, all of it reeked. [MASK] put her hand to her nose and breathed through her mouth. Really! she thought, the English government should do something about this place. People shouldn’t live like this.
<name>she</name>	she	Nicholas	“Aye, an infant. But you need not worry, his mother died long ago.” She was concentrating hard. A son. What had [MASK] said? I had a son, but he died in a fall the week after my brother drowned.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dougless	[MASK] began to understand why pure white bread, called manchet, was so prized. The lower the status of the person in the household, the coarser his bread. Bread that had been bolted only once still had lots of bran— and sand and dirt—in it.
<name>She</name>	She	Dougless	[MASK] couldn’t seem to stop crying. “This has been the worst day of my life,” she wailed. The man was scowling down at her like an actor out of an old Bette Davis movie. “I’m sorry,” she managed to say.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Nicholas	She went to a quiet corner, sat on a bench, then took the package from her pocket. Slowly, she unwrapped it. Touching the waxed cloth bindings that had last been touched by [MASK] so long ago, made her fingers tremble.
<name>John</name>	John	Nicholas	She gave him a hard glare, then started to leave. She didn’t make it out the door because [MASK] slammed it in her face. “Do you spy on me?” he asked. “Do you enjoy watching what I do with other women?”
<name>he</name>	he	Nicholas	He knew she didn’t know her way out of the maze and therefore she was less likely to run from him when he told her what he had to. “I must marry her,” [MASK] said. “It is my duty to my family.”
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Nicholas	[MASK] took the rings and, smiling at her, slipped them onto his fingers, where, she wasn’t surprised to see, they fit perfectly. On the bottom of the box was a bit of old, cracked velvet, and she could see that it was wrapped around something.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dougless	[MASK] got a cold tablet from her bag but hesitated. “Where am I supposed to sleep?” “My son will tend to you.” “Your son locked me in a hideous little room, and there were bugs in the bed!”
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nicholas	you would not be treated well.” “You risk everything because of what people might say?” [MASK] searched for a way to explain what must be so that she could understand. “In your time do you not contract bargains? Legal bargains on paper?”
<name>George</name>	George	Nicholas	[MASK] had cradled her in his arms, gently laughed at her, and told her she was dreaming, that he was with her and always would be. Last night, last night, she thought. He had touched her and loved her, and today he was gone.
<name>Diogenes</name>	Diogenes	Honoria	Laughing at it all, [MASK] said that everyone wore what he could afford, but if a person was found out, he had to pay a fine to the city coffers; then he returned to wearing whatever he wanted to.
<name>Miss Shepherd</name>	Miss Shepherd	Dougless	“I’ll get him a glass of water,” the vicar said, giving a little smile to [MASK] as though to say, You saved him, so he’s yours. “Wait!” the man said. “What year is this?”
<name>him</name>	him	Robert	But as the hours passed, it seemed more and more natural to spend all her time with this gentle man. Watching him look at the world through wonder-filled eyes was becoming a joy to her. And with each passing hour, her memory of [MASK] was becoming less distinct.
<name>she</name>	she	Dougless	As they rode along the rutted road, [MASK] looked at every shadow behind every tree. Being attacked by a dashing highwayman in a romantic novel was one thing, but she knew that, in reality, highwaymen were dangerous.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Dougless	“All right,” [MASK] said abruptly. “I might as well lose the rest of the day. I’ll help you get some clothes and find a place to stay, but that’s it. And I’ll do it for, say . . .
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Nicholas	She was weeping so hard, so intent on her own misery, that she did not see him. [MASK]’s eyes moved from her to look up at the tomb she was clutching—and it was the sight of the tomb that made him step backward.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Dougless	When he finally emerged, he was wearing only a towel about his hips and rubbing his wet hair with another towel. There was an awkward moment when he looked up at her as she sat in bed, fresh-faced, wet hair slicked back, and [MASK]’s heart jumped into her throat.
<name>Moaning Myrtle</name>	Moaning Myrtle	Dougless	I tell you again: Reverse your spell.” [MASK] was recovering herself. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I was having a good cry all alone, and you, wearing that absurd outfit, came in here and started yelling at me.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Honoria	“Come, we will go to the orchard.” They walked briskly down brick stairs, then across a raised walk beside a rose-covered wall, where [MASK] opened an oak door and they entered the orchard.
<name>person</name>	person	Dougless	There were almond tarts and pies of nearly every fruit imaginable, and there were cheeses that ranged from creamy to hard. The fat, sun-warmed strawberries were more flavorful than any [MASK] had ever tasted in the modern world.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Nicholas	“The date,” she whispered. “The date? Ah, yes, the tomb is quite old.” [MASK]’s death date was 1599. Not 1564. Bending, she touched the numbers, trying to make sure she was seeing correctly.
<name>Brienne</name>	Brienne	Dougless	“Come to me,” he said, holding out his hand. “Come to me.” [MASK] ran to him, but she couldn’t reach him. A streak of sunlight came through the windows and flashed off his armor. And then there was nothing.
<name>John</name>	John	Dougless	Blinking, she looked up at him and saw the sublime happiness on his face as he ate his ice cream. [MASK] couldn’t help laughing. “Buried treasure," she said, and startled herself with the words.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name in the context provided)	unknown (There is no proper name in the context provided)	Nicholas	She put up her hands to brace herself against the wall. When [MASK] released her bent leg, she clasped him about the waist, and her hips rose to meet his thrusts as his hands cupped her buttocks and lifted her to him. Higher, higher.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nicholas	Like a mother and child.” [MASK] smiled. “Comfort? You may comfort me any morn you wish.” “Save it for your wife. Now, will you get out of the way? I need to get dressed and get out of here.”
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Dougless	Remember? He nearly walked in front of a bus.” “More than a week ago I saw you nearly step in front of a coach. Later, you asked me the date.” “I . . . ?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Miss Amelia</name>	Miss Amelia	Nicholas	She takes children from the nursery. She teaches the servant children to read and write—as though that were needed. She—” “But you have encouraged all of this,” [MASK] said in astonishment. “I was the one who preached caution when she came.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Elizabeth	“Who will she put on the throne beside her?” “No one, and don’t start on me, because we’ve already had this argument. [MASK] marries no one, and she does a super job of running the country and a lot of the world with it.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Dougless	“Yes,” she said, sadly. “Much, much too much.” He dropped her hand. “You must go. I am a man, and you tempt me more than I can bear.” [MASK] knew she should go, but she hesitated.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Nicholas	“This is serious. I think you owe me an explanation.” “Explain to you?" [MASK] said, getting out of bed, wearing only a pair of tiny briefs. He pulled on his trousers, then turned to her as he fastened them.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Dougless	“A few days ago some tourists went in there. We’ve had to put a lock and an alarm on the door since then.” “Oh,” [MASK] murmured. “I thought it was a rest room.”
