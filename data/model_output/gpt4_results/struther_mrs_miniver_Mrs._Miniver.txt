<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Clem	There was the lavishness of the first two years, based on youthful ignorance, a fixed salary, and a regular parental allowance; there were the soberer standards which became necessary when [MASK] started out on his own; there were the deceptive early successes, the too optimistic move to a larger house.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Judy	[MASK] eventually managed to narrow her field of choice down to two—a blonde in blue silk and a brunette in pink organdie; but between these she was quite unable to decide. “Better toss up,” said her mother at last.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Marigold	A nice child, but pudding-faced. “Well,” she said, “I like [MASK].” “Oh, so do I. But what I mean is, she wouldn’t have done for you.
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Toby	So far as they knew, [MASK] had been paying no attention. But when the noise of their own laughter had died away they became aware of a small reedy voice singing in the far comer, accompanied by a confused twangling sound.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Badger	Yet you have not played truant: truancy has been thrust upon you, thanks to the fact that elderly professors so obligingly live up to their reputation for absent-mindedness. She leant back in [MASK]’s armchair and prepared to let her mind stray wherever it liked.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Badger	(“It’s the only way,” [MASK] explained. “There’s no other approach to an echidna.”) The under-side of the creature was even less attractive than its top view. It had tiny pig’s eyes, squeezed tightly shut.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Clem	Just tagged on to kitchen chairs like that. [MASK]—a small wicker knife-basket. . . As for cars, they were in a class apart, somewhere between furniture and dogs. It wasn’t, with her, a question of the pathetic fallacy.
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Judy	[MASK] was quite different. She was as typically nine now as she had been typically six, and three. Age, to her, was an important and exciting quality: she was never quite at ease with other children until she had asked them how old they were.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Clem	Then she met the chauffeur’s eye in the driving-mirror and hurriedly rubbed the whole thing out, pretending to peer at the view. “But it’s all right,” said [MASK], pursuing his own train of thought.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Clem	It was an argument for the mechanization of life which had not previously struck her. She got home at last. [MASK] was already in, with his legs stretched out in front of the fire. “Successful?” he asked, seeing her festooned with parcels.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Clem	And by that time, of course, [MASK] was awake too. The old transparent stratagem had worked to perfection once more: there was nothing for it but to switch on the lights, shut the windows, and admit that Christmas Day had insidiously but definitely begun.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Toby	Peering downwards through the young leaves, she could see [MASK] making an elaborate entanglement with twigs and cotton over some newly sown grass. He trod on the seeds a good deal, because his soul was bent on getting the pattern of the network symmetrical.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Susan	“But you know you wouldn’t live anywhere else for the world. I believe you’re completely and utterly contented.” [MASK] chuckled. “Not always. Not when the cook breaks her leg on the eleventh of August.” “Oh, everybody has catastrophes.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Vin	(She must tell [MASK] this, next time she wrote.) But it was too early yet to make plans about stockings. First of all, she must get on with that list of presents. She put down her coffee-cup and went resolutely over to the writing-table.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Clem	Well, facts first, they’re easier. [MASK]’s A.A. Battery is quartered in a girls’ school, from which he writes superbly funny letters. The girls are absent, of course, but their school-stories are there, and he is finding these a fascinating study.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Susan	“Bah-hah,” said [MASK]. “So are you, for that matter. I’d hate your sort of life just as much as you’d hate mine.” “Except for a holiday—yes.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Clem	[MASK] finished his cigarette and ground it out carefully with his heel: the grass was tinder-dry. They got into the car again, conscious that one of their most cherished flags was now stuck in more deeply than ever.
<name>He</name>	He	One	It would have been almost more bearable if he had said it seriously. But just as they were getting into the car a fat woman went past, with a fatter husband. “You did look a fright,” she said. “I 'ad to laugh.” [MASK] had to laugh.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Clem	She nailed her smile to the mast and reverted to the pineapple and the second footman. [MASK] caught her eye across the table. It seemed to her sometimes that the most important thing about marriage was not a home or children or a remedy against sin, but simply there being always an eye to catch.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Clem	It jostled, a bright pebble, against several others: she had had a rewarding day. And [MASK], who had driven down to the country to lunch with a client, would be pretty certain to come back with some good stuff, too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Vin	(he sang) “ ‘to Old Vir-ginny. . . / Tckl That end band's come loose again.” When the two younger ones had been taken off to bed, [MASK] went to the window and peered out at the dripping garden.
<name>Mole</name>	Mole	Clem	His mother looked round just in time to see the bright eyes and sleek furry body before it disappeared behind a clump of reeds. “Oofl” said [MASK]. “Let’s take it a bit easier. You’re in training and I’m not.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Susan	I swear you didn’t have any on you a minute ago. I believe you materialize bits of knitting out of thin air, the way conjurers do with lighted cigarettes.” “No,” said [MASK], “they grow out of my fingertips, like a thread out of a spider.
<name>George</name>	George	Clem	As she did so her eye fell on an article in the newspaper which [MASK] had just thrown aside. “Problems of Marriage,” ran the title. She glanced through the first paragraph. “I am not setting out to decry marriage.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Grand	Oh, quite all right. [MASK]. I love it. This is just my idea of the way to spend a fine afternoon in early spring. For early spring it undoubtedly was, even though there might be a chunk of late winter still to come.
<name>York</name>	York	Yorker	It gave you, in a sense, almost a double life: though never, on the other hand, quite a single one. She found herself involuntarily rehearsing her pebble as she walked. “It was pure New [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Susan	But near enough for a hot day, after lunch. She shut her eyes, taking the Chinese picture with her inside the lids. “Listen!” said [MASK], presently. “I heard a shot.”
<name>Woollett</name>	Woollett	Clem	This acquaintanceship had lasted, neither waxing nor waning, for nearly ten years, and there seemed to be no particular reason why it should ever come to an end. [MASK] said it was part of the white man’s burden.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Vin	“Yes. It’s a new idea that occurred to me last time [MASK] was here. You know how much better they always taste when you eat them straight off the plants? Only the drawback is, there's never any cream and sugar.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Vin	In the train she pulled out the little green shining book and entered in it, from memory, the few and simple appointments which the year had so far contained. “Meet Clem, 2.27." “Pike-fishing with [MASK].”
<name>Clover</name>	Clover	Badger	They made their way towards the main entrance of the Zoo. “On second thoughts,” said [MASK], “we’ll go straight to the echidna. You know the echidna?” “I’ve seen its cage, but it’s never been actually on view.”
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Vin	And then, to [MASK]: “Here’s you with a fishing rod in your hand and a great big fish on the other end of it and a wheen more o’ them lying round about your feet. Oh, it’s going to be a grand year for the fishing, and no mistake.”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Judy	Old horses one pensioned off in a paddock, where one could go and see them occasionally. Or one even allowed them to pull the mowing-machine in round leather boots. But this part-exchange business— [MASK] came racing upstairs and hammered on the door, shrill with excitement.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Nannie	[MASK] sprained her ankle, the cook got tonsilitis, the house-parlourmaid left to be married, and the butterfly nut off the mincing-machine was nowhere to be found. At such times, she knew, you must just put on spiritual dungarees and remain in them until things are running smoothly again.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Clem	They were quite nice, intelligent, decent people; she was personable, and he was well-informed: yet for some mysterious reason one’s heart sank. Their company, as [MASK] said, was a continual shutting of windows.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Vin	daisies, yarrow, and bedstraw; while from higher up still came the heavy, heady sweetness of elder flowers. “GoshI” said [MASK] suddenly, after a spell of silence. “Long Leave’s the end of next week. This half seems to have gone most frightfully quick.”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Teresa	I’m certain. But the trouble is, they keep the two processes entirely separate. They’ve never learnt to think with their hearts or feel with their minds.” “That sounds grand,” said [MASK] ironically (they were old friends).
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Clem	With any luck, he said, it might still be there. “Sure to be,” said [MASK]. “I don’t mind betting it’s the same one I used to see. They’re immortal, these Thames trout.”
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Reen	And [MASK], the eldest—a shrill, wizened, masterful little creature of twelve, who in the last two months had become so touchingly less shrill and wizened (though no less masterful)—had never even hung up her stocking.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Toby	He hoisted [MASK] on to his shoulder and they all four edged their way out of the crowd. The rest of the morning was pure bliss. For over an hour they stood, absorbed, while the immortal melodrama unfolded itself before their eyes.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Nannie	It was [MASK]'s day out and she was going to fetch the children from school. The Royal Hospital, with bare straining trees in front of it and black flying clouds behind, stood sombrely magnificent, a fitting backcloth for the latest tragedy of the world.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vin	True evergreenness does not exist: the word is only another term for the ability to overlap the old with the new. By the time she had finished her letter (which was a long one to [MASK]) the rain had nearly stopped, though the gale was as strong as ever.
<name>Ernie</name>	Ernie	Burchett	“To tell you the truth,” she added with gusto, “I was just wishing summing like this would turn up. Not that I need to do cleaning at present, really, [MASK] and the boys all being in work.
<name>Phyllis</name>	Phyllis	Vin	(Mea mater mala sus est. Absurdly, she remembered the Latin catch [MASK] had told her, which can mean either “My mother is a bad pig” or “Run, mother, the pig is eating the apples.”)
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Clem	“Look!" said [MASK]. “More standing stones. This place must have been stiff with Druids.” He was not unfeeling, but he thought, quite rightly, that she ought to have grown out of this by now.
<name>October</name>	October	Brumaire	It was the wind-month, the blood-month, [MASK], the month of darkness: its sign was the evil scorpion, who, when surrounded by a ring of fire, was said to sting itself and die of its own poison.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Judy	Perhaps the psychologists were right, and the “child mind”—that convenient abstraction—matured earlier nowadays. On the other hand, she herself had outgrown dolls by the age of nine, and here was [MASK], at eleven, buying a new one.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Clem	and he wanted it with a consuming urgency, was to be left alone in a comer with eight elastic bands and an old photograph frame: he said he had had a good idea at tea. So the rest of them had a concert, with [MASK] at the piano.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Judy	The choice of a doll, [MASK] found, was unexpectedly difficult. They were things you didn’t usually get a chance to choose for yourself: they arrived as presents, chosen for you by other people, and you had to get to know them and love them as they were.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Susan	I’d hate your sort of life just as much as you’d hate mine.” “Except for a holiday—yes.” “In fact,” said [MASK], “it’s just as important to marry the right life as the right person.”
<name>Georgie</name>	Georgie	Judy	Therefore, his treasure was safe: there would always be warm moss and pink shells and smooth chestnuts. But the rest of them—even, to a slight degree, [MASK]—would never be exactly the same again. Richer and poorer, but not the same.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Donne	They took it for granted; it did not fire their imagination like the pylons and the power-houses which were now the fashionable emotive symbols. But oh, what [MASK] could have made of it, if it had been invented in his time!
<name>Muriel</name>	Muriel	Susan	She smiled, and covered him up with an empty sack. There was no need to wake him until it was time to go home. “From feeding Danger . . ” «•$$» Starlings 25th September 1939 Dearest [MASK], Thank you for your long letter.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Muir	The hammer was whirling now at a great speed, and at last [MASK] swung right round with a kind of grunting groan, and twenty-two pounds of brute metal flew through the air, landing with a thump a few feet from the judges.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Toby	“Meine Sammlung,” he said briefly. “My ejection,” echoed [MASK]’s voice in her memory. Her heart turned over: how could there be this ridiculous talk of war, when little boys in all countries collected stones, dodged cleaning their teeth, and hated cauliflower?
<name>Featherstone</name>	Featherstone	Toby	But when the noise of their own laughter had died away they became aware of a small reedy voice singing in the far comer, accompanied by a confused twangling sound. It was [MASK], blissfully sweeping the strings of his good idea. “ ‘Carry me hume’ ”
<name>William</name>	William	Toby	(The top half she thoughtfully preserved as a squeaker for [MASK].) Just before bed-time the next day she managed to produce a pipe on which, by overblowing a little on the la, she could give a recognizable rendering of “Drink to Me Only.”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Toby	As for [MASK], he remained, in this as in most other matters, unfathomable. In childhood the daylight always fails too soon— except when there are going to be fireworks; and then the sun dawdles intolerably on the threshold like a tedious guest.
<name>Augustus</name>	Augustus	Toby	Next it was [MASK]’s turn. But all he wanted appar- ently, and he wanted it with a consuming urgency, was to be left alone in a comer with eight elastic bands and an old photograph frame: he said he had had a good idea at tea.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vin	So I thought, why not take the cream and sugar under the nets with us? We tried it, and it’s a capital plan. I can’t imagine why I never thought of it before.” She took [MASK]’s arm and led the way across the lawn.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Toby	As they grew older the flotsam of the holi- days, without diminishing in quantity, changed a little in character. There were fewer stones and pieces of wood, though [MASK] still collected flints with holes through them and sticks which had been spirally grooved by honeysuckle.
<name>Farmer</name>	Farmer	Clem	Also, a bonfire is always fun; and here was an excellent excuse for the children to keep one going all day and every day, piling it high with [MASK]’s big bramble-faggots and roasting potatoes (very unevenly) in the intervals.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Clem	“Successful?” he asked, seeing her festooned with parcels. “Look here,” she said, “that screen-wiper—I think what it says is ‘Beef Tea.’ ” “My goodness,” said [MASK].
<name>Anarchy</name>	Anarchy	Bolshevism	But between a woman who thought that for her kitchenmaid to use face-powder was the beginning of [MASK], and a man who believed that the 30-mile speed limit was the thin end of the Totalitarian wedge, there could be no useful interchange of ideas.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Johnny	But there were a lot of things I wanted to do, too, that seemed fairly important. Only one never got around to them, somehow.” “ ‘Time’s winged chariot,’ ” said [MASK] bitterly. “It’s caught us up this time all right.”
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Clem	“I know,” said [MASK] from the ground below. He severed the root of the bramble with a bill-hook and began to haul it down hand over hand like a rope. “This is a prize one.
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Susan	“No, thank you,” she said, in answer to a question from her brother-in-law. “I don’t think I’ll walk the Laosgainn beats—I’ll stay here with [MASK] and join you again when you’re doing the Low Moor.”
<name>Alfie</name>	Alfie	Penny	She breasted the foothills briskly. But her son had already slithered to the ground on the other side, and was bearing down upon some new sightseers with outstretched palm. "This wye to the trenches, lidy. [MASK] to show you round. . . .”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Carter	An invisible, indefatigable blackbird went on saying “Doh-mi!” from somewhere on the other side of [MASK]’s Lane; he had made this remark so many hundreds of times every day that they were all beginning to ignore it.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Nannie	“It’s no such thing,” said [MASK] primly. “It’s a nice big new work-basket, that’s what it is. Just the thing I need, with the amount of stockings they all manage to wear out down here.”
<name>Angus</name>	Angus	Muir	[MASK] was a huge man. His chest muscles stood out through his thin singlet and his kilt was the size of a barrel. He stepped forward, rubbed his hands, stamped his toes into the ground to get a firm stance, and gripped the haft of the hammer.
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Badger	The door opened and [MASK] came in. His beard arrived first, his eyebrows next, then the rest of his vast yet twinkling bulk. “I’m afraid I’m a little late,” he said. It was five minutes past two.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Nannie	That’ll be that bicycle you’re wanting for your birthday, my lamb. . . . And whatever’s this I can see in yours, [MASK]? My lands! I believe it’s a wedding-cake!”
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Toby	Wherever she stopped to call or listen for [MASK], she found herself at the converging point of eight green alleys; and from the root of every plant four strings stretched upwards and outwards to the wire trellis overhead, each with two bines climbing round it the way of the sun.
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Woolley	“[MASK] and the rest of 'em dig to uncover past civilizations. We dig to bury our own.” "I hear they're going to roof them in and put flower-beds on top.” "Very suitable
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Toby	It was much too late to go back, of course: there was nothing to be done except wait and see how he would take it. One never knew, when setting out to comfort [MASK], whether to prepare first aid for a pinprick or a broken heart.
<name>Bree</name>	Bree	Gladys	She let the children take turns in pouring spoonfuls of batter on to the hot griddle, and in watching each little sizzling yellow pool go beautifully brown round the edges. She even let [MASK] make a few, on condition that she gave up her regrettable Sassenach habit of calling them “flapjacks.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hansi	But she had done more than smile when [MASK], after a day or two’s distant politeness, had taken her by the hand and led her to a row of curiously-shaped pebbles in a secret hiding-place between the wood-stacks.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Badger	"[MASK]! You, rubber-necking?” "I've been working with pyridine all day, and I need a breath of air.” "So do I. Not pyridine—people. I was just going to do a Whitman. Why not come too?”
<name>George</name>	George	Toby	When they got out of the car [MASK] discovered that he had left the key of his motor-boat at home. It was much too late to go back, of course: there was nothing to be done except wait and see how he would take it.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Donne	We may not, of course, ever get the chance: but if we do, and once more fail to act upon it, I feel pretty sure we shan't be given another one. As usual in all moments of stress, I’ve been falling back on [MASK].
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Clem	Those beautiful long lean young men so often filled out into stage churchwardens at forty-five. But she had been lucky, or had a flair; [MASK]’s good looks were wearing well. The great thing, perhaps, was not to be too successful too young.
<name>Morag</name>	Morag	Toby	Oh, it’s going to be a grand year for the fishing, and no mistake.” And to [MASK]: “Now there’s two wee wheels in this one, as plain as plain. That’ll be that bicycle you’re wanting for your birthday, my lamb. . . .
<name>Farmer</name>	Farmer	Carter	Beyond the potato-patch, close under the high-banked hedge which separated the garden from [MASK]’s Lane, there stood three apple-trees. These, during the last few years, had been stealthily but steadily invaded by an army of brambles.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Clem	She had once bid furiously at an auction for a lot described as “Twelve kitchen chairs; also a small wicker knife-basket.” [MASK], knowing the size of their kitchen, made urgent signals to her across the room.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	But [MASK], taking the first scoop with his wicker basket, said “Thirteen.” And thirteen it turned out to be. It was certainly a relief to knock off for a bit, to straighten one’s back and stretch out one’s fingers.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Susan	“Oh, everybody has catastrophes. The only thing that matters is to be properly cast, so that you get the kind of catastrophes you can deal with. I think that’s what I meant, more than contented. You’re quite perfectly cast, [MASK].”
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Judy	He was into her bed in a flash, stocking and all. The tail of a clockwork dog scratched her shoulder. A few moments later another head appeared round the door, a little higher up. “[MASK], darling, it’s too early, honestly.”
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Judy	It was exactly what she had so often thought about the boringness of the sort of man who “likes women.” “And besides,” [MASK] went on, “she makes such a Thing about everything, if you know what I mean.”
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Clem	Fortunately he was in a philosophical mood. He just said: “Oh, well, we can watch the others," and trotted off to the pond with [MASK], his feet beating crotchets against his father’s minims.
<name>George</name>	George	Clem	“Let's try and find out what it is. It may not be drains at all. It may be a dead rat under the floor.” “Bore like a dead sheep,” said [MASK], as, holding their noses, they proceeded down the kitchen passage.
<name>Lyddy</name>	Lyddy	Ivy	“You git aan wid y'r owan jaab, Ma, an’ leave [MASK] be. If she rackoned she ought to goo, she 'ad to goo, diddn' she?” “I don' see naow sort o' sanse in it,” mumbled the old woman, quite unconvinced.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Clem	[MASK], coming out of the cottage, paused for a moment to take a critical look at what they had done. “We’ve made a lot of difference today,” he said, as he handed her glass up to her through the branches.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Clem	But the small, dull weight continued to drag and nag. [MASK] put his head in, dishevelled from a bath. Not for the first time, she felt thankful that she had married a man whose face in the ensuing sixteen years had tended to become sardonic rather than sleek.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Judy	“Look, it’s exactly like a real child—isn’t it lovely?” “Oh, no!” said [MASK] with unexpected vehemence. “I don’t like it at all. You see, it’s not in the least like a real doll.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Badger	"I've been working with pyridine all day, and I need a breath of air.” "So do I. Not pyridine—people. I was just going to do a Whitman. Why not come too?” [MASK] nodded towards the trenches.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Judy	But she clung to the belief that this time, at any rate, children of Vin’s and [MASK]’s age had been told beforehand what it was all about, had heard both sides, and had discussed it themselves with a touching and astonishing maturity.
<name>He</name>	He	Clem	She stopped bidding, and the lot was knocked down to someone else for more than its value by a grateful but mystified auctioneer. “You got mixed up in the lot numbers, didn’t you?” [MASK] said afterwards. “No,” she said, guiltily.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Badger	“Not much,” said the keeper, apologetically. “It’s just about alive, and that’s all you can say for it.” “Let’s get out of here,” said [MASK] abruptly. “It’s as bad as pyridine.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Mummy	“But, [MASK], I can’t tell the time.” He was barefoot and shivering, and his eyes were like stars. “Come here and get warm, you little goat.” He was into her bed in a flash, stocking and all.
