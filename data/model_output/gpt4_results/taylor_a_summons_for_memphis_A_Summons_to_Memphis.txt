<name>Travers</name>	Travers	Clarkson	But the faces all around must have changed. And possibly [MASK] had felt himself guilty of dropping the name of an important connection. Because his eyes did seem to go round the table, and he undoubtedly observed the changed look on our faces. His account stopped then and there.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Clara	No one can give an adequate picture of the person who has captured his imagination as [MASK] captured mine. The important thing would be to show the effect she had on me and the effect our final breaking off and the role my father played in that breaking off had on the rest of my life.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Holly	Even the pictures on our walls seemed to me, this night of my life, devoid of any warmth or vitality. [MASK] and I had selected most of those pictures together, and they represented our common intellectual interests.
<name>He</name>	He	Alex	He was so much so that he was always looked to whenever there was an election of leaders on the playground or in the homeroom. It was, in fact, this very quality in himself that [MASK] loathed at that age and at every later age as well.
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Georgie	In that case we would merely have felt in our bones, as [MASK] no doubt did, that our family life had become a mess and would have managed somehow to walk away from it—even if it meant getting ourselves killed. The conclusion I drew from all this was not harsh.
<name>Leslie</name>	Leslie	Alex	He came on into the living room then and looked out a side window to where [MASK]’s old Chevrolet was stopped in the porte cochere. He smiled at me, and I couldn’t tell for sure whether or not there was irony in it.
<name>Thurston</name>	Thurston	Lewis	I remember that [MASK] sat with his hands clasped about one knee, holding that knee considerably higher than the other and with his foot dangling above the cement floor. He sat there casually as if he had been fully clothed and perhaps in the boardroom of his downtown office.
<name>Waverley</name>	Waverley	Robertson	She and I smiled at each other with satisfaction. She rode beside me the two miles down the Pike, and when we reached the white gravel lane that led to [MASK]’s Academy she threw me a kiss, reined her horse around, and headed for home.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Phillip	and then her lower lip, trying to decide whether it would be better to break her news gradually or abruptly. She decided on the former, I suppose. “Yes, [MASK],” she declared, lifting her voice a whole octave.
<name>John</name>	John	Phillip	But I managed to lead her to the nearby couch and there returned her kiss many times over. Finally she held me a little away from her and looking directly into my eyes she said softly, “Some night I want you to go with me to my room, [MASK].”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Clara	(I couldn’t manage the word “husband.”) He was white-haired and sleek, I said to myself, and in his dark pin-striped summer suit he was the epitome of what [MASK] and I used to call “Chattanooga proper.”
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Alex	Even his broad-brimmed felt hat had a rakish quality about it, turned up in the back and perched at a slight angle over his left eye. Neither [MASK]’s knit cap nor my little, narrow-brimmed Tyrolean number could compare for style.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alex	What I said caused me to stop there for a split second longer. Because it was only when I had spoken to [MASK] about his keys that I became aware of my own intentions. And then I was filled with doubt again about what my intentions were.
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Josephine	Your father is making plans to marry.” Actually I burst into laughter. My father. As if he had not always been more hers and [MASK]’s father than anyone else’s! But it was more than that.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Carver	(My father had been called “Black” [MASK] on the Vanderbilt football team, and his head never looked blacker than when in contrast, as it was that day in the locker room, with the full exposure of his very white naked body.)
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Holly	[MASK] held it in the palm of her hand for a moment and then she, the person who cared nothing for jewelry or trinkets, said what was the least she could say, I suppose: “It’s really rather pretty, isn’t it?”
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Macbeth	“[MASK] does murder sleep!” He had come only to fetch the key to our house but he seemed determined to wake the entire household. And that was what he did. All at once lights appeared in half a dozen windows of the high brick fa£ade.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Howard	I remember he talked about his own children more affectionately than he had used to do. He said that his boy [MASK] had been in difficulty with the law lately, said that the boy really seemed to have bad luck in everything.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Phillip	This hesitation was cause for concern, because neither of my sisters is given to hesitation over what to say or how to say it. Finally she could resist no longer plunging right into the matter: “It’s Father, [MASK]. Your father is making plans to marry.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Holly	You must have had it a very long time.” It had never occurred to me until now that [MASK] ever looked “amongst my things.” She had of course seen it in my bureau drawer, where I often kept it.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Alex	We should all welcome the benign spirit of my two sisters, I wrote [MASK]. Surely their merriment in the matter must come to everyone as a welcome change. Surely it wasn’t what anyone on the scene could have expected.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	And then on the following day he would be up early and off to his office while she frequently slept the entire morning, exhausted, she liked to say, by the thought of the party she had not even attended. About my sisters [MASK] certainly understood much less than I.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	[MASK] and I together had in former days often been with my two sisters at the kind of big Memphis Christmas parties which people of all ages attend, and we had there seen them surrounded sometimes by a devoted little band of contemporaries whom they were electrifying with one of their innocent-seeming anecdotes.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Josephine	He looked altogether in command of the situation. And yet [MASK] knew that except for those tables immediately around him and close to the doorway where he stood, he could not actually distinguish which tables were occupied and which were not.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alex	She’s not here.” He spoke through his teeth, barely parting his thin lips, which were drawn very tight. “Maybe she’s been delayed,” [MASK] suggested hopefully from the front seat, though I think we all knew instantly that she was not coming.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Betsy	“He died in his sleep last night,” [MASK] said. “It is assumed it was a heart attack. Anyway, it’s a blessing it came when he was asleep.” “I don’t believe it!”
<name>He</name>	He	Alex	[MASK] felt I would be profoundly shaken if events there at home went the way he thought surely they would go, would be shaken, that is, if he did not prepare me for what he considered the likely inevitability.
<name>Yoshi</name>	Yoshi	Alex	“How this town has grown,” I said, to change the subject. “I haven’t seen so many expressways anywhere. Even [MASK] had trouble finding his way here from the airport,” I said, though of course this was untrue.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	George	It was from those establishments, comfortable, two-story houses with canvas awnings reaching out over all windows and extending from the porches, too, that they were so useful to my brother [MASK] and me whenever we wished to achieve some degree of independence for ourselves.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Josephine	How was it possible not to be amused by the image of him as a bridegroom? Yet I knew my laughter was a rude and impolitic thing to do, and when my sister [MASK] called a few minutes later I was well enough prepared to be able to restrain myself.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alex	After I left home his letters to me came much more regularly than those from any of my family. Important news of the family was much more likely to reach me first from [MASK] than it was from anyone else.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Clara	On the coldest days [MASK] and I used to sit beside the stream and watch the swift passage of the transparent water. We delighted in it especially when there were inlets of ice along the edges, and the water flow seemed to have to make a great struggle not to freeze altogether.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Clara	The first thing I did was to count the number of other children at their table. There were five altogether, and none of them less than a teenager. Then I looked at [MASK]’s face. It was lined and thin but still quite beautiful, I thought.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Betsy	He had never hesitated to use all his cunning as a courtroom lawyer to persuade his children to follow the course he prescribed. I remember how [MASK] closed her eyes on this occasion and placed her hand on mine. “Don’t I know!” she whispered.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Clara	[MASK] was waiting for me always in the library. When I came in and at once handed her the book she blushed and smiled at me in delight, like a little girl receiving her first present at her birthday party. “Am I to open it now?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alex	He smiled at me, and I couldn’t tell for sure whether or not there was irony in it. “I am afraid your car is in my car’s way,” he said to me, knowing perfectly well of course that it was [MASK]’s car.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Phil	“How old are you, [MASK]?” he asked. I confessed I had just turned thirteen. But there was nothing ugly in the tone of his question and nothing in his face afterward to make me feel uncomfortable.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Betsy	None of his four children, you see, has ever married. And now here were his two unmarried, middle-aged daughters about to have the final word on his own marriage plans. I could not explain my amusement to [MASK].
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Betsy	“What in the world is wrong?” Now there was another silence on [MASK]’s part. She was debating further how best to tell me. This hesitation was cause for concern, because neither of my sisters is given to hesitation over what to say or how to say it.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Josephine	Then I heard [MASK] say: “Why, you know, I’m absolutely sure it is!” Without pretending to turn and look, without lifting my eyes from my plate, I said: “That’s who it is, my dear sisters.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	[MASK] had reached him on the telephone with this news scarcely two hours ago, and the bride-to-be in the rush of all she had to do was not answering her telephone this morning. But she and a woman friend would join them in the parson’s office at a quarter till twelve.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Betsy	My receding hairline, my stooped shoulders, my slovenly way of dressing all precluded that. And so as I spoke into the telephone I quickly changed my tone. I was prepared to be distracted and amused. “What is it, [MASK]?” I asked.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Alex	I suppose he elected to go to the house for the talk because of the private nature of the subject for discussion, but also because it was a Saturday afternoon and he reckoned that [MASK] would not be at his University office.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Alex	But in the case of [MASK], it was relatively easy to face him again. And it was not merely his sympathy that was consoling—more, rather, the feeling he could give one that it was indeed his own reserved behavior that was outrageous and not one’s own self-pitying outbursts.
<name>David</name>	David	Alex	Although he was almost feminine in his awareness and in his concern for the feelings and the experience of other people, [MASK] was otherwise the epitome of masculinity in a boy just entering adolescence. He was a kind of norm for twelve- and thirteen-year-old Memphis boys.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jo	But [MASK] perceived that he was doing what she had so often seen him do—what we all had so often seen him do—in situations where he was not perfectly in command. That is, he was brazening it out. He was not giving in even to the smallest defeat.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Betsy	The two girls were very considerate of each other and perhaps the more so because in those days they seemed so very different in character and appearance. [MASK] was blonde and vivacious, an excellent horsewoman, was even a good jumper, and was good at all the outdoor sports.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Betsy	The three women in the party were all of them in form-fitting dinner dresses with low necklines and long sleeves. Very comme il faut! (The French phrase and the exclamation point are [MASK]’s, naturally.)
<name>She</name>	She	Betsy	She stood up but kept her hand on his shoulder. “No, I suppose you would not,” he said under his breath. “Maybe you should come back and lie down for a while,” [MASK] said to him.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Alex	“[MASK] is coming to take me to the airport.” “Of course he is!” he said. And he threw back his head and gave a quick little laugh that was quite literally nothing more than a mere “ha-ha.”
<name>She</name>	She	Clara	It doesn’t matter whether [MASK] was beautiful or merely striking-looking, whether she was a sensitive and gifted artist or a young woman of great spirit and force, someone who inspired the best in me or made me feel humble in her presence.
<name>my sister</name>	my sister	Georgie	It was I who was taken along on these occasions simply because I asked to go and because [MASK] did not ask. It is a certainty that at this time in our lives my father believed that he and I were temperamentally and intellectually very much alike.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Alex	In that very first class on that very first day I was given a desk to share with [MASK]. I won’t ever forget the look he fixed me with when I slid into the seat beside him. It was both cordial and cold—warmly cordial and coldly observant.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Jo	[MASK] got down on her knees and placed her hand on his, which rested still on the chair arm. “I’m sorry, dear,” she said. “I know it seems ironic it should come at this time.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Betsy	“I didn’t know [MASK] had high blood pressure,” I said. “It’s nothing special,” she said, smiling significantly up at me. “At our age we all have something, don’t we?”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Betsy	There was to follow the period during which the old gentleman’s nightlife would become something quite different. Along with everybody else concerned, I began hearing about it at once. And it was at once apparent that [MASK]’s
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	If slit skirts were the fashion, then my sisters’ would be vented well above the knees, exposing fleshy thighs which by this time in my sisters’ lives were indeed of no inconsiderable size. Whenever I was at home I had ample opportunity to observe that all [MASK] told me about them was true.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Alex	(I had been quite fat as a small boy.) It was this, I think, that accounted for [MASK]’s first question to me when English class was over on that first day when I slipped into the seat beside him.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Betsy	A third man “sported” ([MASK]’s word again, of course) a maroon dinner jacket. All three of them were decked out in pleated-bosomed shirts with ruffled cuffs of course that extended several inches below the jacket sleeves.
<name>everyone</name>	everyone	Alex	I said “gull” for girl and “bud” for bird. Soon [MASK] would notice that I carried my books like a girl, in the crook of my arm. And I walked more like a little boy than an adolescent.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Holly	When [MASK] opened the door to her second-floor apartment, the darkness and dinginess that I at once became aware of beyond her slight figure seemed a welcome refuge from the bright lights and the noise in the courtyard. We went inside and sat down facing each other on two very hard straight chairs.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	One	[MASK] perceived in their manner as well as in their attire that they were now on duty! Even between their greetings to us they were busily giving orders to the servants and to the moving men about where their possessions should “go.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Alex	But when [MASK] wrote me, as he did almost every week during this period, he tried to put the best face on it. “At least,” he wrote, “this indelicacy on their parts is better than the other thing.
<name>Mr. Chips</name>	Mr. Chips	Alex	It wasn’t an easy moment for [MASK]. Here he had no more than got me straightened out with regard to long trousers and a correct haircut than there appeared before him a towering human creature even more foreign than I had seemed, in his attire and in general appearance.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Phil	And the reply then would be something like: “We may surprise you yet, [MASK] dear.” But as for me, I felt certain they never would. And of course, as it turned out, they never did.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Holly’s	In both cases—mine and [MASK]—we were urged to come home, if only to help cheer the patients. We neither of us considered going, but we went on talking about what was to be done for those two poor old souls, our fathers.
<name>Miss Kenton</name>	Miss Kenton	Holly	This, at any rate, was how, within a few days almost, I was brought to see the man I had for so many years thought of merely as selfish. It was mostly under [MASK]’s influence that I came to a so much more interesting and enlightened view of him.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Betsy	The old gentleman was dressed appropriately enough, [MASK] thought, in a gray pin-striped suit, a striped tie, and a pale blue shirt with a button-down collar. Both my sisters always had a good deal to say about the appropriateness and inappropriateness of other people’s dress.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Alex	5 I remember that by the time I was in my early twenties there was no one but [MASK] to whom I could confide my feelings. This was especially true with regard to my feelings about the unhappy end to the great love affair of my youth.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Alex	But he didn’t seem to mind or even to be aware that he drove a battered-up old car. I waited half the distance to the airport before asking what [MASK] had on his mind that he wished to talk to me about.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Holly	I would just have to walk off and leave it. That seemed the likeliest solution. It was just because [MASK] had felt I would never be able to settle myself comfortably again in another apartment that she had insisted upon her moving out, instead of my doing so.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Phil	Later when he was no longer with us and we were alone in the car or when we were at our parents’ house, where I would be staying, I would be asked my opinion of the man I had just met. “What manner of man do you take him for, [MASK]?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Betsy	“You know I wouldn’t lie about something like that,” [MASK] said. She stood up but kept her hand on his shoulder. “No, I suppose you would not,” he said under his breath.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Betsy	It was as if certain kinds of information had been allocated to each sister. [MASK], in one of her letters, enumerated the night spots (with precise addresses) and specified the Cotton Carnival balls at which the old gentleman had been seen “attempting to dance.”
<name>Annabelle</name>	Annabelle	Clara	[MASK] opened the presents with consummate care, one by one, and after each opening we embraced. She would throw back her head and laugh with delight and then we would exchange long embraces, sitting beside each other in our heavy winter clothes on the creek bank.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Holly	Now through [MASK]’s influence I saw them as evidence of his imagination about himself and the kind of life he could make. He had now at last become a heroic figure in my eyes. It was his very oppositeness from me that I could admire without reservation, like a character in a book.
<name>Nothing</name>	Nothing	Alex	Nothing less.” His brothers and sisters, unlike my own, were well-adjusted people, always being held up as ideals by their schoolmates. But as [MASK] liked to remark later in his life, they never amounted to a great deal after school years.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Betsy	Two days before my departure I telephoned her secretary and asked that favor. When the secretary called back to give me my schedule she said [MASK] had requested that I come by her house on the morning I was to leave and have breakfast with her.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Holly	I knew that I wished to have [MASK] back with me on 82 nd Street, and she had told me on the telephone that she wished to come back if that turned out to be what I desired after our present interview.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Alex	When we had come to a stop outside the front door, [MASK] could not be persuaded to go inside the house or even to set one foot out of the car. I knew that he must feel that he could not bear the sight of my sisters.
<name>Weymouth</name>	Weymouth	Josephine	I knew of course that the second call would come soon. And even if I had not been anticipating that second call from [MASK], still the first had raised enough forebodings and memories to keep me from returning to the desk work that had been interrupted.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Josephine	I had to turn it over to see that it was from [MASK]. There had been postcards of the just-keeping-in-touch variety from both of them, but no letters. Somehow I had come to feel there would be no more letters—ever.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Betsy	He had not at any time during the evening seemed to be aware of his daughter’s presence. As for [MASK] and her escort, whose identity was not mentioned in her letter to me, they kept close to their table in a dark and remote corner.
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Alex	As I came out and got into the car I noticed what I hadn’t noticed yesterday, that his Chevrolet was indeed a very old model with several large dents that had obviously been painted over by an amateur. I reflected that anyone but [MASK] would have apologized for its appearance.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Clara	[MASK] had been sent away by her parents, and I had resumed my dreary hours in my rooming house. Then on December 7th of course the whole face of life changed. I was alone in my room on the Sunday afternoon when the news came that we were in the War.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Holly	This was an accusation which [MASK] and I frequently hurled at each other. In the beginning our complaints about our families had been perhaps our deepest bond. We had long since, however, worn out the subject. And so I said not another word about my visit home on that occasion.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Betsy	[MASK]’s condescension to these people fairly leapt from the pages of her letter and especially so of course when she turned her attention to the women. The three women in the party were all of them in form-fitting dinner dresses with low necklines and long sleeves.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Holly	Until I came under the spell of [MASK]’s new spirit of reconciliation—with family and with Father—such aspirations and achievements of my father had represented for me his willfulness, his selfishness, and even a certain ruthlessness.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Clara	In the following months I felt on some days I was going to die from heartbreak and I only wished to die. But on other days I only hated [MASK] for treating me so and for allowing herself to be so treated.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Holly	([MASK] is such a feminist that she doesn’t miss an opportunity like that.) I went directly to the kitchen and began putting together a midnight supper for myself. After a few minutes she came in and sat down opposite me at the little enameled table where I was eating.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Holly	He found it suffocating. If [MASK] nowadays felt a longing to return and be a part of that life and even have a part in their bickering over the bric-a-brac, she. knew that she could never really do so.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Phillip	It was then he who got up and went over to the window, and without looking back at me he said: “I want to see you again, [MASK]. There’s something I’d like to talk with you about.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Holly	When I was not going over manuscripts and proof sheets I suppose I was wondering what it was that was wrong between [MASK] and me. Neither of us knew why things had gone so sour, why the satisfaction had gone out of our formerly serene existence together.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Betsy	Meanwhile, our old father, abandoned by the other two couples of the party as well, sat alone at the big table on the edge of the dance floor. [MASK] said he looked conspicuously lonely there, like a dejected clown.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Phillip	He was a man with the strength still to accept whatever fate brought him and to take advantage of whatever opportunities large or small that there might be for his talents. Presently he said to me: “How long are you going to stay with us this time, [MASK]?”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Alex	Or at any rate in the front rooms and during the first moments there was silence. The silence that greeted us was disturbing to me. As the two of us stood together in the living room I felt that I was more the stranger in this house than [MASK].
<name>Each</name>	Each	Each	For weeks and months we had kept going over the particulars of our systematic, well-ordered life, expecting to find the trouble in some element of our life that was perhaps just too obvious for us to see. [MASK] accused the other of having an interest in someone else.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Betsy	But I hadn’t yet decided about this when we heard the telephone ringing in the back part of the house. Presently someone answered it, and I supposed correctly that it was [MASK]. Then I heard her walking very fast up the hallway toward us.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Alex	On the other hand, [MASK]’s observations were to be trusted more than my own only with regard to the truly conventional Memphis people. He sometimes made the mistake of forgetting how strange the Carver family seemed to him when he first knew us.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Josephine	For the most part, it was not actually something he said directly but something in the tone of his voice. And he spoke belittlingly of any young man who began coming to see [MASK]. They somehow seemed smaller than Nashville young men, he said, and they seemed uncertain of their manners.
