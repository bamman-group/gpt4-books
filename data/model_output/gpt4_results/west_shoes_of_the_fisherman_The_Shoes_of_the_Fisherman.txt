<name>Cardinal</name>	Cardinal	Leone	I have a free and easy commerce with other members of the Curia, but between [MASK] and myself there is always a kind of inhibition and uneasiness. It is my defect as much as his. I am still resentful of his Roman rigidity . . .
<name>Quixote</name>	Quixote	Holiness	They grapple each day with every human dilemma - birth, passion, death, and the act of love ... But if they hear no trumpets, see no crusader’s cross lifted up .. .* He shrugged and broke off. ‘Excuse me. [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Rinaldi	'He has suffered more than we. Perhaps he has more right to trust his heart than we have.’ ' I know that I could wish he trusted me a little more.’ * I know he trusts you.’ [MASK] made the point firmly.
<name>She</name>	She	Chiara	Why this restless dissatisfaction with the public image of himself? Why this doubt that he could survive any longer without a permanent supplement to himself?... A woman, of course. There always had been women in his life, but [MASK] was something new and special....
<name>Cardinal</name>	Cardinal	Campeggio	A sweat broke out on his face and palms, and he struggled to compose himself as the Pope mounted the steps of the altar supported by his assistants. [MASK] cocked an astute eye at his queasy colleague and then leaned forward and tapped him on the shoulder.
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Corrado	‘I’m a woman. Not an ordinary womaa Oh no 1 A sapphic woman they call me, but I prefer to say a full woman, a guardian of the deep mysteries of our sex ... So you’re in love with [MASK]’s wife.’
<name>Stefan</name>	Stefan	Kamenev	You may communicate my thoughts to [MASK] and make known to him the contents of this letter. He knows that I cannot move alone, just as he cannot. We both live under the shadow of the same risk.
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Chiara	‘It’s a thing hard to explain ... I - I don’t want to lose you ... I don’t want to lean on you too much, either. With [MASK] I was trying to hold on to youth, and I didn’t have enough of it left.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Holiness	But if I should die before they are done?’ ‘Does that worry you?’ ‘Sometimes ... Believe me, [MASK], whatever the outcome, I have tried to prepare myself for it But I am convinced that there is a truth in my researches...
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Calitri	I am not so free to move as others, so I have to ask you to come to see me.’ ‘I am honoured. Holiness,’ said [MASK] formally. ‘I shall have to ask you to be patient with me, and not resent me too much.
<name>Lysenko</name>	Lysenko	Kamenev	‘They approve, of course - why should they not? [MASK]’s mark is on every one of them too. Besides, the man is a genius. Who else could have done what all the Five Year Plans could not do - brought the Siberian plains into flower?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Chiara	That’s why she got out.’ ‘For my money, [MASK] is a selfish little bitch. You’re lucky to be rid of her.* He was still stubborn in self-pity. He shook his head.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Faber	* ‘He’s a colleague,’ said [MASK] evenly. ‘Nothing more.’ ‘Have you ever lent him money?’ ‘No.’ ‘Borrowed from him?* ‘No.’ ‘That’s curious.
<name>Alexander</name>	Alexander	Kamenev	If anyone stumbles on my account, then I shall be the one to answer for it... [MASK]’s letter is open before me, and beside it is his gift for my coronation - a few grains of Russian soil and a package of sunflower seeds.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Goldoni	To me, in my knowledge of the man, the message is quite evident. Before the crisis become irreversible, he wants to establish a ground of negotiation, so that peace may be preserved.’ ‘But what ground?’ asked [MASK].
<name>Cardinal</name>	Cardinal	Goldoni	‘The calm is deceptive, I think. The pressure is building up, and before another year is out I think we may see a renewal of crisis. [MASK] was talking to me about it only yesterday. He is making a special report to the Pontiff.’
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Calitri	‘ I may not be able to answer it. Holiness.’ ‘This problem of yours. This thing that drives you. How do you define it for yourself?’ To his surprise [MASK] did not balk the question. He answered it bluntly.
<name>Capri</name>	Capri	Positano	They can be pretty dull, I know, but at least one isn’t alone.’ ‘You wouldn’t think of joining me for a few days? [MASK] first, then Ischia.’ She did not shrink away from the question, but faced it in her forthright fashion.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Strange	‘ [MASK]. We profess and we teach that the Pontiff is preserved from fundamental error by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. I pray but I hear no thunder on the mountain. My eyes see no splendours on the hills.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Giorgio	The others craned over his shoulder, staring at the portrait ‘It’s queer,' said [MASK], ‘very queer. You’re almost his double.’ ‘I am the Pope,’ he told them, and they gaped at him as if he were a ghost *
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Calitri	Now she’s back to normal and I am the one with the needs.’ ‘Doesn’t she understand that?’ ‘That’s the sixty-four-dollar question... By nature she’s impulsive and generous, but living with [MASK] has changed her.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Holiness	He speaks simply, freely, and from the heart, and this is what I propose to do.’ The old lion held his ground and went on stubbornly. ‘There are realities to be faced, [MASK]. The voice will change, no matter what you do.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Platino	Holiness,’ said [MASK] deliberately. ‘I have prayed much. I am still not sure that I am right, but this is what I believe. With our mission boy, we have in one sense succeeded admirably. We have educated a good human being.
<name>Ashe</name>	Ashe	Chiara	He made a gesture of defeat. ‘Don’t you understand? That’s what I found out! There’s nothing to destroy. There’s no me at alL There’s just a bundle of good manners and journalist’s habits ... [MASK] was shrewd enough to see it.
<name>Mycroft</name>	Mycroft	Robert	‘I should like to be able to guess what they may be.’ ‘[MASK] has already pointed to them in his letter.’ He quoted again. ‘ “An action of such magnitude and such risk that none of us would be allowed to attempt it.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jean	This is the moment you were afraid of. I am here with you. I am your friend - your brother. But the moment is yours.’ ‘You want me to submit?’ ‘You must, [MASK], you know that.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Peter	The heralds presented their drawings for his coat of arms: crossed keys for [MASK]’s charge, a bear rampant on a white ground, above it the dove of the Paraclete, and, beneath, the motto, ‘Ex ortente lux.
<name>Barreto</name>	Barreto	Kiril	Holiness. There was nothing else we could do. I myself had no part in this. The commissioners were appointed at Your Holiness’s direction.' ‘We know that.’ [MASK]’s address was studiously formal. ‘You have our thanks. Eminence.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chiara	‘You don’t hate me?’ ‘How can I hate you? But I don’t want you to hate yourself because of me.’ ‘If it doesn’t work out with [MASK]...’ She closed his lips with a last light kiss.
<name>yoti</name>	yoti	Calitri	I can get that much by lifting a phone and telling [MASK] that you’re gunning for him... Tell yoti what Give me a thousand and I won’t make the call’ ‘Go to hell! ’ He pushed back his chair, and walked out.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Faber	[MASK] shrugged unhappily. ‘I was trained as a crime reporter. I have a talent for this sort of thing ... But I can't say that I’m very proud of it.' ‘Love’s an expensive business, isn’t it?’
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Perosi	* I don’t want to make any claims. All I want is to be free.’ ‘ I know, I know. And you’re a sensible girl. There are, however, a couple of other matters. [MASK] here will explain.’
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	George	So I’m a man already?’ ‘Are you more of a man because you drink like a pig?’ She had silenced him at last, and now she began to plead with him. ‘Look, [MASK], a man’s life is his own business.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Kiril	Come now, let’s relax for a while.’ They ate simply but well in [MASK]’s private apartment. They talked discursively of men and affairs and the hundred intimacies of the hierarchic society to which they belonged.
<name>Gaspare</name>	Gaspare	Eminence	You have yet to learn what it is to be old.' He paused a moment, recovering himself, and then asked, ‘Now that we are at one. Holiness, may I ask you a favour?’ ‘What is it. [MASK]?’
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Perosi	[MASK] and his colleague bowed themselves out. ‘We are always at the disposal of the Minister.’ ‘Good day, gentlemen, and thank you.’ When the door closed behind them, the princess threw back her bird’s head and laughed.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Kamenev	‘You may have a copy if you like. As you see, the President is perfectly willing that [MASK] should see the letter.’ ‘No copy will be necessary. I have a photographic memory. It’s worth a lot of money to me.
<name>Wyszynski</name>	Wyszynski	Goldoni	Our brother bishops who went to prison with Your Holiness are all dead. The Soviet frontiers are sealed against the faith. I see no prospect of their being opened in our time.’ [MASK] added agreement. ‘I have already put this view very clearly to His Holiness.’
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Jean	‘Here you sit, my [MASK], writing your visions of a world perfecting itself, while I sit like a telephone operator between two men, each of whom can blast us into smithereens by pressing a button... There’s a dilemma for you.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	George	‘I’ve lost the habit of living alone ... And you did say I could call you.’ ‘I’m glad you called, [MASK]. I don't like living alone either.’ ‘You’re not offended?’ ‘Why should I be?
<name>Matthew</name>	Matthew	Kiril	I am the reed through which the voice of the spirit must be blown so that men may hear it in the mode of their own times... The paper is blank before me, the pens are ready. Is [MASK] ready? I pray that he may be.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Chiara	He told her [MASK] was out of town. He was feeling lonely and depressed. He would like to take her to dinner. She hesitated a moment, and then accepted. The incident was over in two minutes, but it wrenched her out of depression and into an almost normal world.
<name>Ortega's</name>	Ortega's	Calitri	‘... Five hundred dollars, American money, for a sworn statement about [MASK]’s marriage, written in the terms I shall dictate to you.’ He sat back in his chair, lit a cigarette, and waited while the artist cupped his brown face in his hands and thought for a long time.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Chiara	But if you don’t want to be a man, then ifs your own affair 1’ ‘But I’m not a man, sweetheart! [MASK] proved it to me. Two weeks away and she’s playing kiss-me-quick on the Lido with someone else.
<name>David</name>	David	George	‘ I wonder if you really know what’s involved for me. A woman needs to be married, [MASK]. She needs to have a home and children, and a man who belongs to her. What we have is wonderful, but it isn’t enough.
<name>He</name>	He	Pm	I think the party will have a reduced majority. We’ll have to open out a little further in coalition with the Left, but even so [MASK] assured of a seat in the Cabinet* ‘And that’s the end of the story?’
<name>I</name>	I	L	He said softly, ‘We have both been in prison, you and [MASK] We both know that when they tried to break us, it was not with the love we had, but with the resentments that we had buried deep inside us.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Calitri	‘How long do I have?’ 'How long would you need to make other arrangements with your paper?’ ‘I don’t know. A month, two months.’ [MASK] smiled. ‘Two months then. Sixty days from this date.’
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Leone	In a loud voice [MASK] challenged him: ‘Acceptasne dectionem? Do you accept election?’ All eyes were turned on the tall, lean stranger with his scarred face and his dark beard and his distant, haunted eyes.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Faber	I am told he is anxious to make more direct contact with the 75 press. There is talk of a regular luncheon with senior correspondents, and your name is, of course, first on the list.’ ‘I’m flattered,’ said [MASK] dryly.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Chiara	First she had set him to rights with the Church, without which he could neither arrive at power nor begin to rule comfortably. Then she had isolated [MASK] for a whole month from her American lover. She had set her down in a gay playground sur-
<name>Latour</name>	Latour	Rinaldi	’ ‘We have forty thousand men,’ said the Jesuit dryly, ‘and they are all bound to him by solemn vows of service. We stand, all of us, at his call’ ‘Not all of us,* said [MASK] without rancour.
<name>Pius</name>	Pius	Kiril	When he arrived at the papal apartment, he found the new Pontiff alone, sitting in an armchair, reading a small volume bound in faded leather. When he knelt to make his obedience, [MASK] stretched out a hand and raised him to his feet with a smile.
<name>John</name>	John	Leone	I do not say that [MASK] is one of these, but I have to be careful. I shall have to work differently from any of my predecessors, and I cannot submit myself to the dictate of any man, however high he stands, or however good he may be.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Kamenev	It was the same which he had endured in the hands of [MASK] and he had been brought to it by the same process: months of self-questioning; recurrent crises of pain; sudden and spectacular revelations of the complexities of existence, beside which the simple propositions of faith seemed pitifully inadequate.
<name>Maigret</name>	Maigret	Kiril	The barman made a sweeping gesture of contempt ‘ So you want to pay! But when and with what? How do I know who you are or where you come from?' ‘ If you like,’ said [MASK] with a smile, ‘I’ll leave you my name and address.’
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Faber	‘That’s the risk you have to take. If the stakes are high enough, I think you might be wise to take it.... I should add that I may be able to give you a little help in your inquiry.’ ‘Why?’ asked [MASK] sharply.
<name>Protestants</name>	Protestants	Moriscos	the motions and became converts - [MASK] might be a better name! We took the new identity and we were admitted. ‘ I was a child then, but it seemed that the new country and the new religion opened their arms to welcome me.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Fve	You see, [MASK] never made any pretence of what I am. People have accepted me on my own terms, just as the country will accept me again at the next election ... So, it is checkmate. The game is over. You should pack up and go home.’
<name>Cellini</name>	Cellini	Rinaldi	The cooking is bad, and I haven’t had time to reform the papal kitchens. I hope your company will give me a better dinner than usual.’ He pointed to the yellowed pages of the book, and chuckled. ‘Our friend [MASK] has a sense of humour.
<name>I'm</name>	I'm	Fm	‘I know you didn’t, darling; but I do. The moment you can tell yourself that I’m trying to mother you, or make myself another Chiara, then [MASK] no good to you. You’re up and away, and on the bottle again.
<name>Barrett</name>	Barrett	Semmering	The proposition which [MASK] had presented to him was devastatingly simple - that a man centred in God had nothing to fear. But he was still troubled by the knowledge that he had been all too easily separated from this centre and led astray into egotism.
<name>Father</name>	Father	Rinaldi	* I do, and yet...’ He broke off and stared unseeing across the reaches of the classic garden. [MASK] prompted him gently. ‘Go on, my son.’ ‘I’m afraid - desperately afraid!’ ‘Of what?’
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	T&dmond	For the rest there is no censure. They simply ask for a re-examination.’ [MASK] seemed to shrink back into himself. His hands trembled. He shook his head. ‘There isn’t time. .. Twenty years’ work depends on that volume.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rinaldi	‘You’ve done a great deal better than you’ll admit.’ ‘I need time and reflection to set my soul in order,’ said [MASK] quietly. ‘May I count on you to help me resign?’ ‘Of course.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Jean	‘It isn’t all wrong, [MASK]. They don’t say that They simply challenge certain propositions. These are the only things you have to clarify ...’ ‘There isn’t time ... At night I hear the knocking on the gate.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	George	* ‘ He hasn’t asked me to live with him yet.* ‘And he’s not going to ask.’ ‘Then I’ll ask him: he’s a straw man. I’m a straw woman. I don’t have any pride, [MASK].
<name>Giulia</name>	Giulia	Rinaldi	[MASK] laughed and rang the bell for the next course. ‘I’ll give you my advice. Relax. Enjoy your dinner, and let the affair take its own way. Even the Holy Office can’t do as well for the Church as the Holy Ghost...’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kamenev	Think of me gently sometimes. Yours, [MASK] They were all separate voices. Yet in their diverse accents they expressed a common hope that man, living under the shadow of the mushroom cloud, might yet survive in peace to fulfil a divine plan in his regard.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Corrado	After that it’s just a formality ... As you will see from hits letter, [MASK] is disposed to be generous. He wants to pay you quite a large sum by way of settlement On the understanding, of course, that you will make no further claims on him.’
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Tddmond	[MASK] shook his head. ‘I don’t think so. If there were, believe me I should ask it. I think at this moment I am more afraid of this dilemma than I am of dying.’ ‘You do not think you have been reckless?’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Aunt	‘Do you see another ending, [MASK]?’ ‘Yes!’ Her old hands readied across the table and fastened like talons on his wrist ‘You have twelve months left to plan it, but if you plan aright, you can lead the country.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Campeggio	[MASK], the layman, smoked his cigar and talked freely, a prince among the princes.(... First it seems we have to present the Pontiff in the most acceptable light. I have thought a great deal about this, and you will all have read what we have already done in the press.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Potocki	Equally important was the question of his successor. He had to be named and in readiness to take office immediately the old fighter died. He had to know of his appointment, yet it had to be kept secret lest the authorities moved against him, before [MASK]’s death.
<name>Chadwick</name>	Chadwick	Campeggio	These are important sources and important voices, as you know.’ ‘ I’m well avyare of it’ ‘Good,’ said [MASK] briskly. ‘Then you understand the importance of preserving a good relation without, shall we say, embarassing incidents.’
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Perosi	‘I am.’ ‘ So far so good. This will give us a ground to reopen the case with the Rota.’ [MASK] pursed his pale lips and frowned. ‘Unfortunately it will not be sufficient for a decree of nullity.* ‘Why not?
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Calitri	There’s only one way to be amused or content - the way to which she has been bred Her marriage to [MASK] shocked her dreadfully, but basically it didn’t change her view of life ... I think in the end you may be more fortunate than she is.’
<name>Ruskin</name>	Ruskin	Goldoni	[MASK] is right, of course, but I do not believe he is wholly right. The truth has a virtue of its own; the good act has a virtue of its own, and we must never discuss the fructifying power of the Almighty...
<name>me</name>	me	Pope	For the first time he smiled at them, sensing their uneasiness and trying to calm them. ‘I know the thought that is in your mind - that you may have for [MASK] an innovator, a man avid for change. This is not so.
<name>Quincey</name>	Quincey	Leone	The others, the rare ones, commit themselves, as if by an instinctive act, to be tools in the hands of the Maker. If this new man is such a one, then it is he whom we need.’ ‘And how do we know?’ asked [MASK] dryly.
<name>Pius</name>	Pius	Kiril	He smiled and added an afterthought of his owa ‘From the little I have learned I should say that Your Holiness has a greater stature in the world than you may realize.’ [MASK] considered the thought for a few moments and then delivered himself of the firm pronouncement. '
<name>Rome</name>	Rome	Peter	The power did not reside in them but in Christ and none could assume it but by lawful transmission and election. The See of [MASK] was vacant. So they struck two medals, one for the Camerlengo, which bore a large umbrella over crossed keys.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	George	Don’t you understand? This is a conspiracy.’ ‘ [MASK], darling, don’t be so melodramatic All we’re trying to do is get justice for me You couldn’t call that conspiracy, surely.’ ‘ It wears the colour of it.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Jean	He tossed another pebble into the water and watched the ripples fan out towards the farther shore, until they were lost in the shimmer of sunlight. Then he asked another question: ‘Have you never been a pessimist yourself, [MASK]?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Holiness	‘I will try not to resent you. [MASK].* ‘Thank you. Before you go I should like to tell you that here, in this place three nights ago, I stood and suffered with a man who is as dear to me as life.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Chiara	Besides ...’ She reached out a skinny claw and imprisoned [MASK]’s hand. ‘Besides, you don’t want to make another mistake. You’ve been hurt enough already. I should hate to see you wounded again. Take time, child. Enjoy yourself.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Calitri	It was a gesture made in a dream but it was more eloquent than words. Until her marriage to [MASK] she had been protected at every step - by rich and doting parents, by cosseting nuns, by the traditions of her class.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Chiara	[MASK] flushed, and was suddenly angry. ‘That’s my business. It doesn’t concern anyone else.’ ‘ On the contrary, my dear young lady. I hope to persuade you that it is the business of everyone.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	George	‘So am L I’ve made the round of the bars, too, [MASK]. If I didn’t have a weak stomach I’d be a lush three times over. It’s no answer, believe me.’ ‘What is the answer?’
<name>Giulio</name>	Giulio	Holiness	..’ It was the first time he had used the Cardinal’s first name. ‘I am very grateful to you.’ ‘And I to you, [MASK]. You have given me peace and the opportunity to share my life with a great man.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	George	You can never pay for anything you’ve done, because you can’t change the consequences. They go on and on. The bill keeps mounting up by compound interest until, in the end, you’re crushed and bankrupt. It isn’t payment we need, [MASK].
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Kiril	He gave a small, dry chuckle. ‘Just as well, perhaps; otherwise you might find half the world in monasteries, and the other half jumping off a cliff.’ To his surprise [MASK] acknowledged the irony with a smile of good humour.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Campeggio	* I’ve always understood that. I’m interested to know why you bring it up now.* [MASK] pursed his thin lips and looked down the backs of his long, manicured hands. He said carefully, ‘ I make the point to explain my next question.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kiril	I’m trying to find out.’ ‘This way?* asked [MASK] quietly. ‘It’s the only one I know. I’ve tried all the others.’ Then she laughed, and for the first time since their meeting she seemed to relax.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Faber	[MASK] flushed and said testily, ‘We’ve discussed it So far we haven’t made any decision.’ ‘Then let me advise you very strongly not to do it at this moment... Don’t misunderstand me. Your private life is your own affair.’
<name>Latins</name>	Latins	Poles	We have not always acted like brothers in the faith, but like enemies one to another. The time of dissension is past, but if Your Holiness were to remember it too harshly, it could be bad for us all. We [MASK] are Latin by temper and loyalty.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Chiara	Exasperated, he slumped forward in his seat and tried to find a grain of consolation in what this Kiril might mean to himself and [MASK]. So far the Curia had kept him tightly in wraps. He had made few public appearances, and no pronouncements of any moment at all.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Potocki	I was oppressed by the futility of it all, and I wondered whether it were worth spending so many lives, so many more noble spirits, to try again.... Those were bad days, and worse nights.’ [MASK] flushed to the roots of his thin hair.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Chiara	‘I suppose because [MASK] is just the opposite. In spite of everything that has happened to her, she seems completely certain of what she wants in life, and how she’s going to get it There’s only one way to be happy - her way.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	George	‘Comes a tune when we all fall apart, [MASK]. The real test is when we have to put ourselves together again.’ 'And what do you expect me to do? Dust myself off, stick a flower in my buttonhole, and walk back into business as if nothing happened?’
