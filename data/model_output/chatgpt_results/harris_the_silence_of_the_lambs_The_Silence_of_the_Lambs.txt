<name>Sniper</name>	Sniper	Tate	They were set up in moments, two SWAT officers in black body armor and headsets climbing the stairs to the third-floor landing. With [MASK] in the lobby were two more, their assault rifles pointed at the elevator ceiling.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Ardelia	You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you moved things along. You deserve a chance yourself. Why don't you go ahead and crash? I'm fixing to shut this down myself." "[MASK]. Thanks."
<name>She</name>	She	Starling	"What do you see. [MASK]?" "Well, she's not a local—her ears are pierced three times each, and she wore glitter polish. Looks like town to me. She's got maybe two weeks or so hair growth on her legs.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Starling	The door to the room pushed open a few inches. [MASK] felt the movement in her heart before she knew what it was. A cat came in, a large tortoiseshell cat with one eye gold, the other blue. It hopped up on the bed and rubbed against her.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Starling	[MASK] stood at the edge of the water. Almost every place has a moment of the day, an angle and intensity of light, in which it looks its best. When you're stuck someplace, you learn that time and you look forward to it.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Crawford	You say you don't know why [MASK] helps you—do you know why I did?" "No, tell me." "Do you think it's because I like to look at you and think about eating you up—about how you would taste?"
<name>death</name>	death	Mapp	She delivered the paper to the night duty officer and fell into her grateful bed, the voices of the day still whispering, softer than [MASK]'s breathing across the room. On the swarming dark she saw the moth's wise little face.
<name>the door</name>	the door	Catherine	He must have done it at the fuse box, pulled the lever, where would it be? Where would the fuse box be? Near the stairs. Lot of times near the stairs. If it is, he'll come from that way. But he's between me and [MASK].
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Roden	He's killed six at least. Time's eating us up." "Do you think he's holding another woman right this minute, while we're looking at his bug?" [MASK] asked in her face. His eyes were wide and his mouth open.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Pity	It would have been fun to hunt her for a long time— he'd never hunted one armed before. He would have thoroughly enjoyed it. No time for that. [MASK]. A shot in the face would be fine and easy at eight feet. Now.
<name>she</name>	she	Starling	Well, a brown recluse spider is the only kind to worry about, and it wouldn 7 build out in the open, [MASK] said to herself. The rest don 7 raise much of a welt. There would be space to stand beside the rear fender.
<name>Dale</name>	Dale	Crawford	Do you make him cross the whole board? Who do you play against, a sloth?" "I have the specimen Special Agent [MASK] called about.” "I can't imagine why we didn't hear your siren,” the pudgy one said.
<name>Pembry</name>	Pembry	Starling	His nameplate read pembry, t.w. and his desk set included a telephone, two riot batons, and Chemical Mace. A long pinion stood in the corner behind him. "Yes, I am," [MASK] said. "I've questioned him before."
<name>Chew-eez</name>	Chew-eez	Precious	" He'd have to shut her up here in the upstairs bedroom while he got through with the noisy part in the basement—she hated the noise and got terribly upset. To keep her occupied, he'd gotten her a whole box of Chew-eez while he was out shopping. "[MASK]."
<name>Curious</name>	Curious	Shaken	"You viewed the remains?" "Yes." "Had you seen his earlier efforts?" “No. Only pictures." “How did you feel?" “Apprehensive. Then I was busy." “And after?" “[MASK]."
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Starling	Light and voices came through the frosted glass. She went in. Three men in laboratory coats worked at a table in the center of the room beneath a brilliant light. [MASK] couldn't see what they were doing.
<name>the driver</name>	the driver	Copley	She filled her lungs deep and looked at the ceiling for a moment. "How'd he do it?" "He got away in an ambulance, [MASK] said. We'll go into it. How did you make out with the blotter acid?"
<name>Sabina</name>	Sabina	Starling	"Pity you have to pander now and lick a few tears when you can," [MASK] said. “It's a pity we didn't get to finish what we were talking about. Your idea of the imago, the structure of it, had a kind of . . .
<name>I</name>	I	Starling	I hope the call didn't spook you." "No." Not totally true, [MASK] thought. "Your instructors tell me you're doing well, top quarter of the class." "I hope so, they haven't posted anything."
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Lamar	"I don't believe I'll have one." "No, hold it under your neck there," [MASK] said, "and on that little bump at the back of your head. Cold'll make you feel better. It does me."
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Crawford	"I'll post the hotline and the Latent Descriptor Index when I take your prints up to ID," [MASK] said. "You draft me an insert for the file. An insert, not a 302—do you know how to do it?"
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Catherine	"Yes. Don't leave me." "I have to leave the room for just a minute." "You fucking bitch don't you leave me down here, my mother will tear your goddamn shit brains out—" "[MASK] shut up.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lecter	“No, no. Get a more assertive Tease porridge hot' quality into it. The meter varies but the intensity is the same." [MASK] clapped time softly, “Pease porridge in the pot nine days old. Intensely, you see. Fervently. '
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Catherine	[MASK] did not know how long she had been captive. She knew that she had washed twice—the last time she had stood up in the light, wanting him to see her body, not sure if he was looking down from behind the blinding light.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Gumb	The beauty contestants looked very World War II. They wore Rose Marie Reid swimsuits, and some of the faces were lovely. Their legs were nicely shaped too, some of them, but they lacked muscle tone and seemed to lap a little at the knee. [MASK] squeezed the poodle.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Mapp	"What's that?" "You meet two guys, right? The wrong one'll call you every God damned time." "I been knowing that." The telephone rang. [MASK] touched the end of her nose with her pencil.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Starling	He had to have a rope. Where was it? Go see. [MASK] moved across the stairwell in one rush, to the door of the workroom, door's the worst place, in fast, back and forth along the near wall until she had seen all the room,
<name>John</name>	John	Tate	One of them popped an intrave- nous plasma pack, but the other, taking blood pressure and pulse, shook his head and said, “Downstairs." Orders on the radio now. "[MASK], I want you to clear the offices in the tower and seal it off.
<name>She</name>	She	Starling	The padlock jumped like a frog in her hand and lay there open, heavy and greasy. The other lock, having soaked, was easier. The door would not come up. [MASK] lifted on the handle until bright spots danced before her eyes.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Lecter	There were two or three copycats after that. The papers, when they were playing around with the Buffalo Bill tag, they emphasized more than once that this killer doesn't take scalps. It's no surprise after that—he probably follows his press. [MASK] was guessing.
<name>Medic</name>	Medic	Copley	They did their job. The ambulance never made it to the hospital. The police are still looking for it. I don't feel good about those medics. [MASK] said they're playing the dispatcher's tapes. The ambulances were called a couple of times.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Starling	The victim was a heavy-hipped young woman sixty-seven inches long by [MASK]'s tape. The water had leached her gray where the skin was gone, but it had been cold water and she clearly hadn't been in it more than a few days.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Crawford	Maybe [MASK] was bringing the bug to be identified. Why else would he want her at the Smithsonian? But any agent could carry a bug into the Smithsonian, an FBI messenger could do it for that matter. And he told her to pack for two days.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Chilton	"Has your attorney petitioned—" “[MASK] put that television in the hall, set to a religious channel. As soon as you leave the orderly will turn the sound back up, and my attorney can't stop it, the way the court is inclined toward me now.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Starling	Even in the play of light over the features, it remained dumb and dead. [MASK], in this moment, examined herself. She was pleased. She was exhilarated. She wondered for a second if those were worthy feelings.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Pilch	Time, [MASK]." The black-haired one looked around at her, saw her leaning against the doorframe with her briefcase. He put the beetle on some rotten wood in a box and covered it with a lettuce leaf. When he got up, he was tall.
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Lamar	When they brought him in here, the muffler had got hot under the car trunk and burned him just like that, only across his hip," [MASK] said. "I can't put groceries in the trunk of my car for it melting the ice cream.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Alonzo	She stared into his face, and with the smallest tilt of her head, she gave him her good looks and bored her knowledge in, speared him with it, knowing he couldn't stand for the conversation to go on. He sent her with an orderly named [MASK].
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Starling	Some of you gentlemen are worried I'll call on you next. Your worries would be justified—[MASK] is well above average with both hands. That's because she works at it. She works at it with the little squeezy things you all have access to.
<name>Buffalo Bill</name>	Buffalo Bill	Starling	At least five times, and probably more, over the past ten months he had abducted a woman, killed her and skinned her. ([MASK]'s eye raced down the autopsy protocols to the free histamine tests to confirm that he killed them before he did the rest.)
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Hannibal	What was it that got you, [MASK]? Was it those good, hard ankles? The way her hair shines? She's glorious, isn't she? Remote and glorious. A winter sunset of a girl, that's the way I think of her.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Pilcher	" "When?" "May and August." "I was just thinking," [MASK] said. "Your specimen's a little better developed than the one we have, and it's fresh. It had started fracturing its cocoon to come out.
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Barney	"You sure I knew the bug was in that desk I brought you?" [MASK] said as handed her the stuff. "I have to give that some thought. Here's a pen, write your phone numbers on the bag.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Starling	Understand what I'm saying?" "I can get a makeup on the Code," [MASK] said, opening a barrette with her teeth. “Right, and you fail it with no time to study, you think they won't recycle you?
<name>M</name>	M	Crawford	No one was in the outer office, so she fluffed briefly by her reflection in the glass doors. She knew she could look all right without primping. Her hands smelled of gunsmoke, but there was no time to wash—Section Chief [MASK]'s summons had said now.
<name>Alex</name>	Alex	Gooood	He rolled her onto her face and checked her scalp, parting her thick hair with his fingers. The padded cast hadn't cut her. He checked her pulse with two fingers on the side of her neck and found it strong. "[MASK]," he said.
<name>Love</name>	Love	Fredrica	A cat came in, a large tortoiseshell cat with one eye gold, the other blue. It hopped up on the bed and rubbed against her. Looking for [MASK]. Loneliness. Big lonesome girls trying to satisfy somebody. The police had eliminated lonely-hearts clubs early.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Starling	Look how she bleached the fuzz on her upper lip. She was pretty careful about herself, but she hasn't been able to take care of it for a while." "What about the wound?" "I don't know," [MASK] said.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Skip	"[MASK] said maybe she'd found her a chubby-chaser. But no, she never had anybody like that. She had one boyfriend, but that's like ancient history. He was in the band in the tenth grade, I say 'boyfriend'
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Clarice	elegance that's hard to get away from. Now it's like a ruin, half an arch standing there." “Half an arch won't stand. Speaking of arches, will they still let you pound a beat, [MASK]? Did they take your badge?"
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Crawford	[MASK] might take it away from her and give it to someone else. She'd have to take that chance. She tried to call him from a phone booth, but found he was budget-begging for the Justice Department before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Raspail	Six inches of sodden leaves, mixed with paper cups and small trash, had banked against the bottom of the door of [MASK]'s storage unit, number 31. A hefty padlock secured each side of the door. The left-side hasp also had a seal on it.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Precious	On his middle a hot-water bottle gurgled, as the little dog's stomach had gurgled when she lay on him. He couldn't stand it any longer—what he had in the basement holding [MASK] prisoner, threatening her.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Catherine	"You have the power to let my daughter go unharmed. Her name is [MASK]. She's very gentle and understanding. Please let my daughter go, please release her unharmed. You have control of this situation. You have the power. You are in charge.
<name>Wintermute</name>	Wintermute	Starling	“This is the hardest time. [MASK]. Use this time and it'll temper you. Now's the hardest test—not letting rage and frustration keep you from thinking. It's the core of whether you can command or not. Waste and stupidity get you the worst.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Miggs	Looking with purpose at this face, with its tongue changing color where it touched the glass, was not as bad as [MASK] swallowing his tongue in her dreams. She felt she could look at anything, if she had something positive to do about it.
<name>Inigo</name>	Inigo	Starling	[MASK] found it easier to approach the cage when he wasn't looking at her. "Doctor." He held up a finger for silence. When he had finished reading his letter, he sat musing, the thumb of his six-fingered hand beneath his chin, his index finger beside his nose.
<name>He</name>	He	Starling	With his record, this close to retirement, even she can't hurt him that much. So I wouldn't worry about his pension, if I were you." [MASK] lost it a little. "You've got somebody else who's caught three serial murderers?
<name>Babe Ruth</name>	Babe Ruth	Bella	He'd had [MASK]'s relatives all night. "I. . he started. "You know what you did. You hit a home run, kid." He touched her cheek. "What's this?" "Burnt gunpowder.
<name>Lieutenant</name>	Lieutenant	Peterson	"PUT YOUR HANDS ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD AND FREEZE," [MASK] yelled down the shaft. "He didn't move, Lieutenant. . . . Right." "IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HANDS ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD I'LL DROP A STUN GRENADE
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Catherine	[MASK]. Is there a ladder?" "I don't know, I woke up down here. He let the bucket down on strings." Bolted to a wall beam was a small hand winch. There was no line on the drum of the winch.
<name>his partner</name>	his partner	Starling	Nine hours had passed since he transmitted the fingerprints and pictures of the victim, and she remained unidentified. Along with the West Virginia troopers, he and [MASK] had worked the bridge and the river-bank until dark without result.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Raspail	The man was under more strain than anyone should have to bear. He had sent her in to check out [MASK]'s car with no support or evidence of authority. Okay, she had asked to go under those terms—the trouble was a fluke.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tate	[MASK] was back on the radio. "Lieutenant, it looks like he's got two six-shot .38s. We heard three rounds fired and the dump pouches on the gunbelts are still full, so he may just have nine left.
<name>Floater</name>	Floater	Starling	So you got it cut out for you. [MASK]. A floater's no day at the beach, either. It's not punishment for you, but if somebody outside needed to see it that way, they could.
<name>her</name>	her	Starling	It occurred to her then, as it had on a few other occasions in her life, that intense frustration tastes very much like the patent medicine called Fleet's that she'd had to take as a child. Some days you wake up changed. This was one for [MASK], she could tell.
<name>Hannibal</name>	Hannibal	Clarice	He cocked his head slightly and touched the center of his red lip with his red tongue. "If we talk about this, [MASK], I have to have something on account. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, and you tell me."
<name>his</name>	his	Crawford	When he folded his sunglasses and put on his bifocals, she felt she knew him again. When he looked from her face to the report and back again, something passed behind his face and was quickly gone. A more animated mug than [MASK]'s would have shown regret.
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Tate	The offices on two, three and four were supposed to be empty and locked. You could get from the tower to the main building on those floors, if you went through the offices. You couldn't on five. [MASK] had been to the excellent Tennessee SWAT school
<name>Whitaker</name>	Whitaker	Brigham	The lecturer pointed with his chin at the door behind her. Here it came. Her fate shied under her as she turned to see. But it was [MASK], the gunnery instructor, leaning into the room to point to her across the crowd.
<name>Gheorghe</name>	Gheorghe	Zamfir	She had some music, a single-shot Decca record player from the fifties with a jackknife attached to the tone arm with rubber bands for weight. Yard-sale records. Love themes by [MASK], Master of the Pan Flute. When she pulled the string to light the closet.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Gumb	"Not you, silly," he told the little dog, when she raised her ears. [MASK] caressed the back of the form at the natural reach of his arms. Then he walked behind it to consider the powder marks. Nobody wanted to feel a seam.
<name>Prisoner</name>	Prisoner	Lecter	“Command post, two officers down. Repeat, two officers down. Prisoner is missing. [MASK] is missing. Outside posts watch the windows, subject has stripped the bed, he may be making a rope. Confirm ambulances en route."
<name>Her</name>	Her	Starling	She took longer than necessary to put the papers back in her briefcase because she didn't immediately trust her legs. [MASK] was soaked with the failure she detested. She folded her chair and leaned it against the utility closet door.
<name>the sheriff</name>	the sheriff	Crawford	"Then if they hadna been pulling up on the trotline they never would have found her. They prob'ly went off scared and finally called in. I expect you'll want the game warden in on this." "I expect so," [MASK] said.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Pilcher	I want you to tell me the whole thing." "Okay, this is a pupa, an immature insect, in a chrysalis— that's the cocoon that holds it while it transforms itself from a larva into an adult," [MASK] said.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Lecter	Don't deviate from it. Do not deviate from it one iota for any reason. If [MASK] talks to you at all, he'll just be trying to find out about you. It's the kind of curiosity that makes a snake look in a bird's nest.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Mapp	I'll catch up with you in the cafeteria, okay?" "I was so in hopes you'd overcome that ghastly dialect," [MASK] said. "Books are available to help you. / never use the colorful patois of my housing project anymore.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Crawford	Send pix first letter. [MASK] considered for a moment, scratched out "Junoesque," and substituted "full-figured." His head dipped and he dozed. The green screen of the computer terminal made tiny squares in the lenses of his glasses.
<name>Dr. Nolan</name>	Dr. Nolan	Crawford	"Sure, a surgeon can stand to look at a mutilated body," [MASK] said, crumpling his cup and stepping on the pedal of the covered wastebasket. "But I don't think a doctor can stand to see a life wasted."
<name>Carla Jean</name>	Carla Jean	Crawford	She nodded. "He's busy now," [MASK] said, "but when he's not busy, he'll entertain himself. We need to be clear on this: You know he'd do it to you, just like he'd do anybody else."
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Clarice	I guess that was all she knew to say. That's it. We've traded." "Yes we have. You've been very frank, [MASK]. I always know. I think it would be quite something to know you in private life."
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Starling	[MASK] had done her time in boarding schools, living on scholarships, her grades much better than her clothes. She had seen a lot of kids from rich, troubled families, with too much boarding-school time.
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Clarice	"All right, then tell me how—" "It's your turn to tell me, [MASK]. You don't have any beach vacations at the Hoof and Mouth Disease Station to offer me anymore. It's strictly quid pro quo from here on out.
<name>Curator</name>	Curator	Pilcher	It's an unusual weapon and alcohol doesn't affect it in preserved specimens. That helped us narrow the field so we could identify it so fast." [MASK] seemed suddenly embarrassed, as though he had boasted. "They're tough too," he hurried on to say.
<name>Oprah</name>	Oprah	Starling	There were two television minicams in the crowd. [MASK] wished her head were covered. She turned her face away as she approached the entrance to the tower. A state trooper stationed in front of the door examined her ID card before she could go into the foyer.
<name>Dr. Lecter</name>	Dr. Lecter	Crawford	He gets a check from the Veterans and goes to dry out at the VA around Christmas. I been looking for him on this table for fifteen years." "We'll need serotonin tests on the fishhook punctures," [MASK] said. "I'm sending the pathologist a note.
<name>McNulty</name>	McNulty	Crawford	"[MASK]'s a stand-up guy. He made it clear where it matters that you had to secure the scene. He let you go in there bare— that is, bare of all your visible symbols of authority, and he said that too.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Precious	Patiently he picked out the stitches and laid out the pieces. A perfect pattern to cut by. "Tomorrow, [MASK]," he told the little dog as he set the beef brains out to thaw. "We'll do it first thing tomooooooorooow.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Starling	The room was reasonably neat but it had the ruffled appearance left by searchers with big hands, men who try to put things back exactly, but miss just a little bit. [MASK] would have known the place had been searched even without the traces of fingerprint power on all the smooth surfaces.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Raspail	JC SAIC/Section 8 [MASK] had been dead for eight years. What evidence could have lasted in a car that long? She knew from family experience that, because automobiles depreciate so rapidly, an appellate court will let survivors sell a car before probate, the money going into escrow.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Crawford	He was a leader, with a leader's frank-and-open bullshit, all right. "You think about him enough, you see where he's been, you get a feel for him," [MASK] went on.
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Starling	Lives, [MASK] corrected herself. She lives here. In the cabinet of the nightstand were a telephone book, Kleenex, a box of grooming items and, behind the box, a Polaroid SX-70 camera with a cable release and a short tripod folded beside it.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Starling	[MASK] squeezed on that thought to help herself sit in this ever-smaller airplane cabin with her lap full of awful information. She could help stop him cold. Then they could put this slightly sticky, smooth-covered file back in the drawer and turn the key on it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Crawford	No pills are in sight—[MASK] emptied a linen closet in the hall and filled it with her medicines and apparatus before he brought her home from the hospital. (It was the second time he had carried her across the threshold of that house, and the thought nearly unmanned him.)
<name>he</name>	he	Raspail	"You've exhausted the lead?" "Yes." "Why do you think the car [MASK] drove was his only car?" "It was the only one registered, he was single, I assumed—" "Aha, hold it.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Starling	Now [MASK] found herself in a curious state in which she could not be surprised. For a day and a night she'd felt suspended in a diver's ringing silence. She intended to defend herself, if she got the chance.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Starling	[MASK] used her telephone to find out what she could about the storage facility. By the time she spotted the high orange sign, split city mini-storage—you keep the key, she had learned a few facts.
<name>H.H. Holmes</name>	H.H. Holmes	Gumb	The film was edited to exclude some of the more grisly objects. In the far reaches of the basement, the cameras could show only the low, lime-sprinkled thresholds of the chambers holding [MASK]'s tableaux. The body count in that part of the basement stood at six so far.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Pembry	He wrapped [MASK]'s body in the waterproof mattress cover and the sheets from his cell to keep it from dripping and stuffed it on top of the elevator. He put on the uniform, got himself fixed up, laid on the floor and fired shots into the ceiling to start the stampede.
