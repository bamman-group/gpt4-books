<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Brenna	That night as she lay beside [MASK], staring up at the stars, she tried not to think of the ugly siege tower that cast its ominous shadow across the meadow— the tower that would soon be moved into place against Merrick keep’s ancient walls.
<name>Harrenhal</name>	Harrenhal	Hardin	If he attacks [MASK], he risks having his daughters slain in the battle, either accidentally by his own men or—he’ll assume—by us. Since an attack is unthinkable under these circumstances, he’ll have no choice but to try to get the women out.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Brenna	However, my place is with you. And so here I am. And here is dear [MASK] on your other side, who I strongly suspect is concocting some wild scheme to stay behind and remain with your husband’s brother.”
<name>Lucivar</name>	Lucivar	Henry	His subject, however, spoke in the same infuriated hiss he’d spoken in before. “Is that all, Sire?” [MASK]’s brows snapped together, his tolerance at an end. “I’ll have your word to obey. Make your choice,” he growled.
<name>Alayne</name>	Alayne	Jennifer	I’m sorry, [MASK].” The woman he had married would not accept his word, nor his love, but, oddly, she accepted his apology. “Thank you,” she said achingly, “for not trying to convince me or yourself that he was an assassin. '
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jenny	“Trust me,” he said, “all will be well on the morrow.” [MASK]’s spirits plummeted. After the morrow, it would be too late. After the morrow, she’d be wed for eternity to the man whose wide shoulders beside her made her feel puny and insignificant.
<name>Scots</name>	Scots	Scots	She was a Scot, after all, and [MASK] were regarded by many as cold, proud people. And although she was proud to be a Scot, under no circumstances did she want these people—her people—to mistakenly think she was unapproachable.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Graverley	Evidently, because she has, you think she’ll now be willing to betray her family and her country because of it. It sounds to me,” [MASK] finished with open amusement, “that you’ve begun to believe all the court gossip over your supposed prowess in bed.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jenny	At this, the most ominous time of her life, [MASK]’s shoulders began to shake with helpless laughter, and she wrapped her arms around the startled little woman, while mirth exploded from her chest and tears of fear and exhaustion filled her eyes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Royce	“Big what?” “Ears!” she burst out furiously, “But whatever she looks like, the point is, she’ll make my life a living hell.” Unable to restrain himself another moment, [MASK] leaned down and nuzzled her neck.
<name>He</name>	He	Royce	Instead of lying to him, which [MASK] half expected her to do, she surprised him by saying in a helpless little whisper, “I’m frightened. More frightened than I’ve ever been in my life.”
<name>Alan</name>	Alan	Royce	“What is mine, I intend to keep.” His words reminded her of things of her own she had not been able to keep—things that should have belonged to their children. “What’s wrong?” [MASK] asked, watching her expression turn somber.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Jenny	When they approached the guards at the gate, however, [MASK] received a shock. “I’m sorry, my lady,” the guard said with polite implacability, “but my orders are that you cannot leave the castle except in the company of my lord.”
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Royce	he said in a low roar. “Well?" he roared again without taking a breath. “Well? Well?” “Which accusation do you desire me to address first, Sire?” [MASK] replied with courtesy. ‘The accusation of treason?
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Jennifer	“[MASK],” he said gently, but the eyes she raised to 368 him were wild with terror, and he realized at once he had to get her away from the scene of what obviously looked to her to be preparations for a full-scale battle.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Jenny	He hesitated and then nodded jerkily. “There, you see!” [MASK] said looking around at the taut, waiting crowd and raising her voice with relieved conviction, “He meant no serious harm, and the intent is as important as the crime itself.”
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Jenny	“Now that you know that much,” he said in a dangerously soft voice, “suppose you tell me how many men-at-arms your father has?” [MASK] hastily calculated that there must be at least 500 left. “Two hundred,” she said.
<name>Tristan</name>	Tristan	Royce	[MASK] hesitated, suddenly uncertain about how best to approach her. By the time he finally came off the jousting field today, he’d been near collapse, and there’d been no chance to speak to her until now.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Jenny	“Embroidery hoops?” [MASK] provided helpfully. His eyes raked over her in disgust. “I’m afraid not—no embroidery hoops.” “Perhaps a small quilting frame then?” she added, innocently widening her eyes as she held back her laughter.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Royce	“No, please, listen to me,” she cried, her gaze riveted on the drumming pulse in [MASK]’s cheek and the glittering violence in his eyes. “Listen to me,” she begged him. “I did say that to my father.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Jenny	His gaze dropped to her lips, soft and rosy, lips that beckoned to a man to kiss them. Generous, inviting lips. Drowsy and relaxed as she lay against his chest, [MASK] scarcely felt his hand tighten on her chin.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	William	Throwing herself down beside him, moaning his name, she felt wildly for a pulse, but there was none, and her hands rushed over his arms and his face. “[MASK], oh, please—” she cried brokenly, imploring him not to be dead.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Royce	“I’m not so certain we were on the grounds of the abbey.” ‘‘According to the abbess, you were.” “Truly?” she asked, but [MASK] didn’t hear her. Suddenly he was staring intently at the valley, his body taut and alert.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Royce	With an effort of will that was almost painful, [MASK] dragged his hand away and lifted his lips from her cheek. But the moment he did, his hand, which seemed to have developed a will of its own, lifted to her face.
<name>Royston</name>	Royston	Jenny	“The devil?” [MASK] repeated blankly. Hatred contorted the man’s face and he spat on the ground. “Aye, the devil—the Black Wolf hisself, may he roast in hell from whence he was spawned.”
<name>Elain</name>	Elain	Jenny	“Courtesy?” [MASK] nodded because she could not speak. And because she could almost believe the look in his eyes was pain—a pain that surpassed even her own. “That’s all I want,” she finally managed to say.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jenny	Quick, piercing stabs of desire were rhythmically jarring [MASK]’s boidy and she moved with him, mindlessly seeking something she sensed he was trying to give her, and coming closer to it and closer to it as he quickened his driving, insistent strokes.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Royce	On the way back into the hall, [MASK] was so silent that she cast him an anxious glance. “You looked surprised,” she said apprehensively, “when I mentioned two months.” “I was,” he admitted with ironic amusement.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Jenny	Inside the trunks was the most breathtaking array of fabrics she’d ever seen: there were rich satins and brocaded velvets, embroidered silks, soft cashmeres, and linen so fine it was almost transparent. “How beautiful!” [MASK] breathed, touching a length of emerald satin.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Royce	Reaching up, she raked her hair off her forehead with her fingers and gave it a hard shake to move it off her shoulders. [MASK] watched her as she tried to restore order to the lush waves tumbling over her shoulders and down her back.
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Royce	With a silent moan of surrender, she slipped her hand around his neck, her fingers sliding into the curling hair at his nape, holding his mouth pressed fiercely to hers as she welcomed his tongue and gave him hers. Her innocent ardor was more than [MASK]’s ravenous body could withstand.
<name>Stannis</name>	Stannis	James	With his hand he gestured toward the rolled parchment resting on the table at the foot of the dais beside his discarded wine goblet. “That parchment will leave here within an hour in the hands of [MASK]’s emissaries, who will deliver it directly to him.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jenny	[MASK]’s face had given away the answer, and despite her efforts to ease his fury by explaining about the bargain and assuring him that her captor had not been brutal, his rage was uncontainable. His shouted curses had rung to the rafters, and the reason for it had not been kept secret.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Jenny	“Come inside, my dear,” her father insisted, and to [MASK]’s shock it was he who apologized for misunderstanding her desire to go to a cloister rather than dwell with her husband. Which should have made her feel better, but, instead it made her feel more guilty.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Jenny	“I don’t know,” [MASK] began, diverted by a sudden, uneasy feeling that they were being watched in the deepening dusk. Turning and walking backward, she looked down toward the well and saw the villagers had all returned to the warmth of their hearths.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Royce	“ [MASK] understood then why she had come: she had come to finish the task her relatives had begun; to do to him what he had done to her brother. Unmoving, he watched her, noting that tears were pouring down her beautiful face as she slowly bent down.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Royce	I’ve no doubt,” he said with a grimace, “your version will vary from his. He detests you, you know.” Ignoring the last part of that, [MASK] replied with calm, indisputable logic, “My men outnumbered yours almost two to one.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Jenny	“Ah, but what a glorious prison it is,” he commented with an appreciative smile. “Beautiful beyond any castle I’ve seen.” “A prison,” [MASK] informed him darkly, “is a prison!”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jennifer	My men have been through this drill a thousand times.” Putting his hands on her rigid shoulders, he said to her in a calm, firm voice, “[MASK], listen to me. My men have orders not to attack without a command from me personally.”
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Royce	That admission only made her more desirable to [MASK], who was accustomed to women whose experience in bed rivaled his own. His lips curved in a smile, but his hand tightened on her arm, drawing her inexorably closer, while his other hand lifted to her shoulder.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Brenna	Completely blinded by the cloak which had been thrown over her head, and her arms still bound by the rope, she was tossed over her captor’s shoulder. Beside her, she heard [MASK] scream her name as they were carried forward.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Jenny	The wagon shed was beside it, and beyond the wagon shed were the stables, a piggery, and a large dovecote, which appeared to be empty of birds. “Are you looking for someone, your grace?” [MASK] whirled around in surprise at the sound of the friar’s voice.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Graverley	In fact, when you see her, you’ll find she’s lavishly garbed in the clothes belonging to the former chatelaine of this castle, and around her throat is a strand of rather priceless pearls—also owned by the former chatelaine here.” [MASK]’s mouth fell open.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jenny	Each word her father spoke struck [MASK]’s heart like a lash, making her cringe with a shame and hurt that was almost past bearing. When he was finished, she stood there while a blessed, cold numbness came over her, until she felt nothing at all.
<name>James</name>	James	Royce	Her blue eyes opened, smiling sleepily at him as she whispered, “You have a son.” [MASK] swallowed audibly, smoothing her tousled curls off her cheek. “Thank you, darling,” he said helplessly, his voice still raw from the two days of terror he’d lived through.
<name>He</name>	He	Royce	he asked abruptly. The question startled her and seemed to embarrass her. “Seventeen years,” she admitted, rather reluctantly, [MASK] thought, “and two weeks.” “That old?” he said, his lips twitching with a mixture of amusement and compassion.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Royce	Time and again, greetings were called out to one or the other of [MASK]’s knights from friends, but, although her escort never stopped, it still took the better part of an hour to wend their way across the valley floor and up to the western slope.
<name>Alina</name>	Alina	Jenny	“Do we have a bargain?” he asked calmly. [MASK] lifted her small chin, looking like 5 proud young queen who’d just been stabbed by someone she trusted. “I was mistaken in you, my lord,” she said bitterly.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Royce	Assuming the women hadn’t met with some accident or lost their direction, [MASK] knew they would already have made their way down the far side and climbed the next ridge. Even so, he dispatched four men with instructions to comb these hills from one side to the other.
<name>Let</name>	Let	Devil	and she swung again, but this time her fist was caught in a painful viselike grip and held high above her head. "[MASK]!" she cried, squirming, and she landed a mighty kick at his shin.
<name>John</name>	John	Royce	Astonishment registered in [MASK]’s expression as he realized that, at twenty-nine, she evidently regarded him as being long past the age of eligibility for marriage. Recovering his composure he asked in amusement, “Why do you think I haven’t?”
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Jenny	[MASK] looked around at the platters on the table, most of which were already empty, and breathed a silent sigh of relief. “It is—tasty then?” “Fit for the gods,” the knight exaggerated with a grin. “Ask anyone.”
<name>Raphael</name>	Raphael	Royce	His lips quirked in a reluctant grin as [MASK] contemplated tiie stormy beauty in aquamarine velvet who’d already abandoned fear in favor of anger. He found it acutely painful when she feared him. Making an effort to smooth the grin from his face, he nodded.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	William	“For a while, these past few days, ’twasn’t as unlikely as you think,” she said, her beautiful profile somber. “[MASK] will be earl someday, and he’s a kind, wonderful boy—well, man—since he is twenty.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Jenny	“If you will excuse us, we’ll return in about a quarter of an hour, and you can perform the ceremony then." Panic exploded in [MASK], and she stared at him, rooted to the floor. “Where are you taking me?”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Jennifer	But [MASK] had one irrefutable defense in her favor, and no matter how he’d tried to ignore it, it did exonerate her: All because I put myself in the way of your marauding brother by walking up a hill...
<name>Red</name>	Red	Royce	[MASK] rubbed his knuckles against her cheek and tenderly asked, “Am I to infer from that remark that you actually think I’m so good that I could beat him with my shield strapped to my shoulder over a broken arm?” She tipped her head to the side.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Royce	Faced with the choice of shattering her illusions about her father or letting her go on thinking he was a callous madman, [MASK] chose the former. He was not in a mood to be gallant—not at the expense of his marriage.
<name>She</name>	She	Becky	I’d had eyes for the juggler, which was silly in the extreme. [MASK] was so angry, embarrassed, I mean, that when we parted, she told me not to bother coming to the river in the morning because she no longer needed my assistance.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Royce	He’s arranged for the celebration tonight, but begs your leave not to join you until the morrow. Don’t you want to have a look around the place?” [MASK] put his tankard of ale down and wearily rubbed the back of his neck.
<name>Devlin</name>	Devlin	Royce	[MASK] warned ominously, and she swung around. “There’s nothing I’d like better, however, I can’t very well walk through canvas.” Wordlessly, he reached out and lifted the flap, then to her surprise he bent low in an insulting mockery of a bow.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	Jenny	“ ’Twas cut down and shorted while you slept, my lady,” she managed, carefully laying down the overgown and mantle upon the bed. “Really?” [MASK] said, looking genuinely impressed as she glanced at the fine seams at the sides of the golden undergown.
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Jenny	“If he is, ’twould be a sight worth seeing when he tries to mount his horse! Why, ’twould take four squires to hoist him up there!” The absurdity of that image made some of the children giggle, exactly as [MASK] had hoped.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Jenny	[MASK] asked as she carefully sewed the wrist of his shirt completely closed. Beside her were many other items of his clothing which had received equally creative alterations, including several pairs of hose which had been skillfully tightened at the knee to make it impossible for a leg to descend beyond that point.
<name>Nightmare</name>	Nightmare	Thor	Her gaze shifted reluctantly to the broad-shouldered man riding at the front of the party, bareheaded and without shield or sword, mounted atop a great black destrier with flowing mane and tail that could have been sired only by [MASK].
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Jenny	“Or can it be that your loyalty is to him, not us?” [MASK] felt as if he had slapped her, yet in some tiny part of her she realized her feelings for her former captor were a strange enigma, even to her.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Arik	The men behind us have fought beside me for years. They know how I think and what I want done almost without my saying it.” There was no more time to reply, for the castle guard was almost on top of them, with [MASK] in the lead.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Jenny	The noise that had been audible in her bedchamber became a deafening roar as [MASK] beared the great hall, a cacophony of male laughter and music overlaying a sea of conversation. With her foot upon the last step, she hesitated before stepping into view of the revelers.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Agnes	Truly? Do you think the duke would wear that?” “For you,” [MASK] said in a choked voice, as if forced to speak by some inner fashion consciousness that cried out against the misuse of the sable, “not him.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Royce	“If I cannot beat the lady into submission, nor cajole her with words,” [MASK] answered, preoccupied with her rosy mouth, “I suppose I shall have to rely on my only other skill. .
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Jenny	Suddenly the warmth, the security of Ms arms and body and mouth withdrew. Surfacing slowly from the dreamlike daze where she had deliberately sought refuge from the reality of what was going to happen, [MASK] felt cool air touch her skin and, against her will, her eyelids opened.
<name>Redwall</name>	Redwall	Claymore	“In what way?” "He has made a life of battles, and they fear that all his enemies will begin descending on [MASK] one after another to exact revenge. Or that he will invite them here to feed his love of war.”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Royce	“[MASK]—” he added, as he showed him to the place where two veils were hanging crazily from branches without heads underneath them. “It. .. er . . . won’t be necessary for the other men to hear of this, will it?”
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Jenny	Too exhausted to stand, [MASK] sank down onto a pile of leaves a few paces from the fire, reveling in the opportunity to sit upon something soft, something that didn’t lurch and bump and jar her teeth, even though it was damp.
<name>Gisbourne</name>	Gisbourne	Royce	“I’ll fetch the guard,” he said with a final loathsome look at her. “Don’t be a fool!” [MASK] snapped. “Would you have word spread throughout the camp and then the land that I was wounded by a nun? ’
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jenny	His deeply creased, sun-bronzed face, turned to her, watching her with a mixture of suspicion and uncertainty, then he nodded agreeably. “Fifteen minutes,” he said and [MASK]’s spirits soared, “but I want to be able to see the head of at least one of you.”
<name>Rourke</name>	Rourke	Royce	He’ll never believe you could silence both of us. He’ll think I put the rope there for you.” Mentally cursing all Scotswomen to perdition, [MASK] hesitated and then jerked his head in a reluctant nod. “Get dressed,” he gritted.
<name>Wolsey</name>	Wolsey	Graverley	As privy councillor to the king and the most influential member of the powerful Court of the Star Chamber, [MASK] enjoyed tremendous influence, but his very position denied him the hope of a title and the estates that he so obviously coveted.
<name>Stannis</name>	Stannis	Merrick	The knight nodded, but his handsome face was puzzled as he said, “If you’re thinking of [MASK], he can’t gather an army and get it here in less than a month.” “I’m not expecting an attack.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jenny	Her knees quaking violently, [MASK] stood up and walked over to him, trying to tell her outraged conscience that the act she was about to commit wasn’t sinful or traitorous; that in sacrificing herself to save her sister, she was actually doing something noble, even virtuous.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Jenny	Knowing how she had twice fallen into his arms after just such lighthearted discourse as this, [MASK] absolutely refused to be amused or shocked by that heresy, or even to venture any reply. Instead, she broached another topic in a carefully civil tone.
<name>She</name>	She	Jenny	His face whitened at that. “I have accepted only those matches which I was specifically commanded to accept. I’ve declined more than two hundred others.” A dozen sarcastic retorts sprang to her lips, but [MASK] had no heart to speak them.
<name>Thalia</name>	Thalia	Royce	“He does,” [MASK] averred, grinning at her. “Well, we weren’t discussing his looks in the first place,” she said primly as she digested this information about her king, who was said to be as handsome as a god.
<name>Kyra</name>	Kyra	Royce	On the other hand, they weren’t exactly strong incentives to give her up, either. [MASK] glanced up as the guards on the castle wall sounded a single, long blast on their trumpets, signaling the approach of nonhostile visitors. “What does that mean?”
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Jenny	The voluminous wrapper, although very fine, had obviously belonged to someone much taller; the sleeves hung down six inches past her fingertips and the hem trailed a full yard behind her, but it was clean and warm, and after spending days in the same soiled gown, [MASK] thought the wrapper heavenly.
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Jenny	Come to think on it,” [MASK] added, “since this tournament is an annual affair, all of you ought to plan to have added livestock and all manner of other things, too, to sell next year. There’s great profit in it for you.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Royce	My men have orders not to attack without a command from me personally.” She shuddered as if the word “attack” had been all she heard, and [MASK] gave her a slight shake. "Listen to me,” he commanded sharply.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Gertrude	[MASK]’s flush deepened. “You did laugh, didn’t you? Was it because of what I said about being handy with shears?” The woman’s lips trembled and her eyes almost popped out as she strained to keep her nervous mirth contained.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Royce	“It’s not my decision,” [MASK] replied tightly, his anger renewed as he considered the names they’d hurtled at his wife yesterday. “Inasmuch as it was my wife who suffered at his hands, ’twill be up to her.”
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Royce	“Aye,” [MASK] quietly agreed. “But tell me first for which offense. I have taken hostages many times in the last decade, and on more than one occasion you’ve commended it as a more peaceful means of scoring a win than outright battle.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jenny	He would only marry another of his choice and beget his heirs on her.” “I won’t do it,” [MASK] insisted wildly, voicing the first logical arguments that tumbled to mind. “I can’t! It’s wrong. It’s impossible!
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Jenny	But [MASK] didn’t notice; she was so deliriously relieved by the sound of a human voice, and conversely furious that he’d denied her even that for so long, that she could hardly contain her ire. “Good heavens, your grace, I shouldn’t wish to rile your temper!”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Royce	she commanded with outrageous temerity when he jumped in surprise. “I’ll not be blamed for making a poor job of this if you mean to leap about beneath the That sharply worded chastisement from a mere slip of a girl who was, moreover, his prisoner nearly made [MASK] laugh aloud.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jenny	In a daze of suspended yearning and confusion, [MASK] watched him go, and then sanity slowly returned. Shame raged through her as she looked down at her disarranged clothing and tugged it back into place, running a shaking hand through her wildly disordered hair.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	But tonight, that became an impossibility.” “What has tonight to do with it?” [MASK] raised her eyes to his, the expression in them reminding him of a wounded doe, despite the calm, matter-of-fact tone she used.
<name>Sansa</name>	Sansa	Jenny	[MASK] closed the door and slumped against it, laying her cheek against the iron banding, feeling as if she was being torn asunder. The hall was filled with tension and hostility as she walked forward between her two escorts.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jenny	“Marriage,” her father gritted. “Whose?” “Yours.” For a moment [MASK]’s mind went completely blank. “My—my marriage to whom?” “To the Spawn of Satan. To the murderer of my brother and my son.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Jenny	That’s quite a record,” he applauded sarcastically. “Now take your bow, and let the matter drop!” Fortified with a considerable amount of wine and a good deal of natural stubbornness, [MASK] searched his features.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Brenna	“The guard’s asleep at his post,” she whispered jubilantly, turning to [MASK], then she added quietly, “If he awakens and catches me trying to take the horses, follow our plan on foot. Do you understand?
<name>Wart</name>	Wart	Brenna	“Very well,” he sighed, “I suppose I’ll have to reach in there and fetch you.” He crouched abruptly and an instant later a big hand thrust through the branches, groping around and finally closing on [MASK]’s breast.
