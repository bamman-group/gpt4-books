<name>Abbie</name>	Abbie	Schevitz	“But,” said [MASK], “if it’s done in the passion of the antiwar movement, if it’s done accidentally, if everything was done to try to prevent anyone from getting hurt... And do we know she did it alone? We don’t.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Angela	Everywhere she is transported by the police as a prisoner, blacks and whites are waiting in the nearby streets, holding up placards for the TV cameras and shouting, “Free [MASK]! End political repression! End racism! End the war!”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dawn	The life they led together behind their bedroom door was a secret about which their daughter knew no more than anyone else. And on it went, on and on for years; it never stopped until the bomb went off and [MASK] wound up in the hospital.
<name>Swede</name>	Swede	Seymour	‘You heard it here first. The summer of ’67.’ I predicted it in those very words. Didn’t I, [MASK]? Called it practically to the day.” “That is true,” the Swede acknowledged.
<name>Oyuki</name>	Oyuki	Merry	The torso’s not hers! [MASK] is alive! Hers is not the body skewered by nails and blown apart! “As a result of the telephoned warning police arrived at the building at 1:20 and evacuated 24 janitors and other workers before the explosion occurred.”
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Marcia	This is the morality of a country that we’re talking about. Well, isn’t it? Am I nuts? It is an affront to decency and to decent people.” “And what,” [MASK] asked him, “is so inexhaustibly interesting about decency?”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Orcutt	Composition #16, Picture #6, Meditation #11, Untitled #12 . . . and what was there on the canvas but a band of long gray smears so pale across a white background that it looked as though [MASK] had tried not to paint the painting but to rub it out?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mendy	Years ago.” “The fucking bypass. They stick that tube down your throat, don’t they?” “They do.” “I saw my brother-in-law with the tube down his throat. That’s all I need,” [MASK] said.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Rita	So at least she has learned something, at least she is alive and there is reason to be sitting every night in the kitchen waiting to see her at the window with [MASK]. He reads about the parents of the two young women who are missing and wanted for questioning in the townhouse explosion.
<name>He</name>	He	Dawn	Sat there and listened to her. Didn’t at all seem to care that she was a slob, dressed even in college like somebody’s grandmother, and with those buoyant eyes, unnervingly enlarged by the heavy spectacles. [MASK]’s opposite in every way.
<name>Isolde</name>	Isolde	Dawn	There once was in him. That once described everything there was in him. It was not easy to understand how he could ever have found in this prim, severe, hidden whatever-she-was a woman more magnetic than [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Merry	An intelligence no longer impeded by the blight of stuttering. And intelligence was what he was hearing, [MASK]’s quick, sharp, studious brain, the logical mind she’d had since earliest childhood. And hearing it opened him up to pain such as he had never before imagined.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Seymour	That you do just about everything you can to be an intelligent, decent person. Just as I would have imagined before she’d blown up that building. [MASK], believe me, please, I just wanted her to be safe. So I took her in.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Dawn	She has many friends. Besides, she was on top of her stuttering. Stuttering is not the explanation.” “Yes, it is. You never get on top of your stutter,” [MASK] said, “you’re in constant fear.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Nathan	Undo it now if you’d like to.” “I’m afraid I haven’t the daring anymore to undo a brassiere in front of the class.” “What a surprise. Just when I’m ready, [MASK]’s grown up.”
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Vincent	But at dinner he never mentioned the tribute. We just uttered the pleasantries. At some place called [MASK]’s. That was it. As always, he looked terrific.” “He’s dead.” “Your brother’s dead?” “Died Wednesday.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Merry	[MASK] emulating her mother’s concentration, enjoying working with the same discipline, silently delighting to feel an equal in a common pursuit, and in some preliminary way offering them a glimpse of herself as the adult—yes, of the adult friend to them that she would someday be.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Swede	My daughter has nothing to do with you! You little shit—you’re not fit to wipe my daughter’s shoes! My daughter had nothing to do with that bombing. You know that!” “Calm down, [MASK]. Calm down, lover boy.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lou	“My daughter-in-law is a lady. She has no interest in those things.” “[MASK],” his wife said to him, “maybe not everybody sees it your way.” “I cannot believe that.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Seymour	[MASK] loved it. The whole handsome family there, life just the way it’s supposed to be. But when the pie and coffee came he got up from the table, and when he didn’t come back right away I went out and found him.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ira	What is your idea on that subject, [MASK]?’ Peaches. Plums. Nectarines. Grapes. I never saw an apple in my house. My mother is ninety-seven. I got her in a home now. She sits there crying in a chair all day long
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Seymour	The goat eats grass and the skin is like sandpaper. The finest glove leather for a formal glove is what, [MASK]?” “Kid.” “That’s my boy. But it’s not only the kid, son, it’s the tanning.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Merry	Was she the gang leader, this tiny white-faced thug? In a gang the authority is given to the one who is most ruthless. Is she the most ruthless or are there others who are worse, those others who are holding [MASK] captive right now?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Merry	The street where [MASK] lived was paved with bricks. There couldn’t be more than a dozen of these brick streets intact in the entire city. The last of the cobblestone streets, a pretty old cobblestone street, had been stolen about three weeks after the riots.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Sheila	Was it bigger, more important, worthier things that inclined others to a lifelong mate? Or at the heart of everyone’s marriage was there something irrational and unworthy and odd? [MASK] would know. She knew it all. Yes, she’d have an answer to that one too....
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Jerry	asked the woman who had sent [MASK] scurrying. Smiling warmly, she had taken my two hands in hers. Beneath the short-cropped hair, her head looked imposingly well made, large and durable, its angular mass like the antique stone head of a Roman sovereign.
<name>Snip</name>	Snip	Harry	No. Nobody could want to do away with the saliva. That was part and parcel of all that they loved, the son and heir no less than the founding father. “[MASK] can cut a glove as good as any of them.”
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Dawn	Nothing that isn’t admirable in that— abandon first the face assaulted by the child, abandon next the house assaulted by the child. This is her life, after all, and she will get the original [MASK] up and going again if it’s the last thing she does.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Merry	What does one thing have to do with the other? No, [MASK], it does not hang together. What does any of this ranting have to do with you, who will not even do harm to water? Nothing hangs together—none of it is linked up.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Merry	The psychiatrist got [MASK] thinking that the stutter was a choice she made, a way of being special that she had chosen and then locked into when she realized how well it worked. The psychiatrist asked her, “How do you think your father would feel about you if you didn’t stutter?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lou	“Without transgression there is no knowledge.” “Well, that ain’t what they taught me,” he replied, “about the Garden of Eden. But then I never got past eighth grade.” “What did they teach you, [MASK]?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Seymour	“That’s leather,” his father told him. “What makes kidskin so delicate, [MASK]?” “I don’t know.” “Well, what is a kid?” “A baby goat.” “Right. And what does he eat?”
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Dawn	What he had been doing out on the road—which, as though it were a shameful or superficial endeavor, he could not bring himself openly to confess even to [MASK]—was making love to his life. About the intensity of his physical intimacy with his young wife he was actually more discreet.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dawn	Was that why she was in heat over the sink—because of his inbred sense of entitlement? Or was it the laudable environmentalism? Or was it the great art? Or was it simply his cock? Is that it, [MASK] dear? I want an answer!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dawn	“But that’s where the boys went...” “Look, why don’t we save this discussion? There’s nothing wrong with asking questions but [MASK] will be in and out—” “I’m sorry, you’re right,” his mother replied.
<name>Bukowski</name>	Bukowski	Socrates	Can’t argue with that.” “And pussy?” “Over. Live without dinner, live without pussy.” “Who are you, [MASK]? I don’t buy it. Purely the writer. The single-minded writer. Nothing more.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Dawn	The Saturday afternoon the tank sat out in front of the factory—and the Swede, seeing it there, could at last phone [MASK] to tell her, “We’ll make it”—Vicky had gone up and knocked on the lid with her fists until they opened up.
<name>madness</name>	madness	Merry	Could this lead to [MASK], this onslaught of sneering and mockery? She could not insult him enough. Was she impersonating someone, acting from a script prepared beforehand? Or was he dealing with a person who could not be dealt with because she was mad?
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Danny	No! I just wanted to win the money so [MASK] could go to college without the burden on my dad! I didn’t do it for boys to go traipsing after me everywhere—I was trying to help out at home! But then you arrived.
<name>Good-bye</name>	Good-bye	Americana	Good-bye, [MASK]; hello, real time.” “This passed me by. I had no idea.” “That was ’68, back when the wild behavior was still new. People suddenly forced to make sense of madness. All that public display.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Merry	[MASK] herself would be there waiting for him—an absurd fairy-tale hope for which there wasn’t a shred of justification, but which he didn’t have the heart to oppose, not when he saw his wife shedding another layer of sanity whenever the telephone rang.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Seymour	I like you too.” “Do you?” “Of course I do. You know that.” “Yes, I like you, [MASK]. I always liked you. Did you know I liked you?” “Yes, I did.”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Vicky	But the hand itself is an intricate thing. It moves. There is no other part of a human being that is clothed that is such a complex moving structure....” And that was when [MASK] popped in the door with the size-four finished gloves.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Merry	Wondering: If there was some point in their lives before she took the wrong path, where and when was it? Thinking: There was no such point, there was never any controlling [MASK] however many years she managed to deceive them, to seem safely theirs and under their sway.
<name>Annika</name>	Annika	Dawn	The dark colors, according to [MASK], signaled a revolution of the painter’s formal means. That’s what she told him, and the Swede, not knowing quite how to respond and with no interest in what “formal means” meant, settled lamely on “Interesting.”
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Merry	And so was the teacher the problem when she tried to spare [MASK] by not calling on her. So was everybody the problem when they started feeling sorry for her. And when she was fluent suddenly and free of stuttering, the problem was the compliments.
<name>Martin</name>	Martin	Jerry	[MASK] asked. About the cancer scare of the year before, and the impact on urogenital function of the ensuing prostate surgery, 1 said nothing directly. Or rather, said everything that was necessary—and perhaps not merely for myself—when I replied, “Because I’m sixty-two.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Seymour	“She’s not an animal. She’s not like a cat or a bird that you can keep in a cage. She was going to do whatever she was going to do. We had a trust, [MASK], and violating her trust at that point...
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Merry	He for one could not say he hated the kitchen in which [MASK] used to bake her cookies and melt her cheese sandwiches and make her baked ziti, even if the cupboards weren’t stainless steel or the counters Italian marble.
<name>He</name>	He	Sheila	She knew it all. Yes, she’d have an answer to that one too.... She’d come so far, [MASK] had said, she’d gotten so much stronger I thought that she could make it on her own.
<name>Not</name>	Not	Dawn	She hasn’t the faintest idea, really, of what she’s talking about. Know what my father used to say? ‘All brains and no intelligence. The smarter the stupider.’ Applies.” Not [MASK]? No.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Merry	[MASK] as a little girl saying to her classmates, “You want to make five dollars a dozen,” which was what glovemakers were always saying and what she’d been hearing since she was born— five dollars a dozen, that was what you shot for, regardless.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Jerry	A strong possibility: [MASK]’s flipping derisively through my pages and giving me, item by item, the bad news. “The wife was nothing like this, the kid was nothing like this—got even my father wrong. I won’t talk about what you do with me.
<name>Dracula</name>	Dracula	Nixon	“When they get [MASK] on and drive a stake through his heart, your mother will be in seventh heaven.” “And you won’t?” she said. “He can’t sleep,” she told the Swede, “because of that mamzer.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Merry	How could he now tell them what had happened to [MASK], find words to describe it to them that would not destroy them? They haven’t the faintest picture in their mind of what they’d see if they were to see her. Why does anyone have to know?
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Merry	[MASK] feels it’s all gone beyond writing letters to the president. She feels that’s futile. You feel that, futile or not, it’s something within your power to do and you’re going to do it, at least to continue to put yourself on record.”
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Wallach	“No. You wrote a paper for me on Red Badge of Courage. I got an A plus. I handed it in a week late and [MASK] said to me, ‘It was worth waiting for.’”
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Jerry	I thought I could let the rage out of him. But he just cried. He couldn’t let it go. I said this guy was going to get killed from this thing, and he did.” [MASK] said it and it happened.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Sheila	But saying this would be a betrayal of [MASK], would it not? He could no more justify his taking it solely upon himself to confess to her husband than he could had she taken it upon herself to confess to his wife.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Merry	He might as well turn for help to that hefty black woman with the scarred face, expect to find himself by asking her, “Madam, do you know where it is that I am? Have you any idea where I went?” [MASK] had seen him.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Grandma	“I’m sorry. I was remembering the phone calls.” “I understand,” he said. “She was a little girl. You’d call, you’d put her on, and she’d say, ‘Hi, [MASK]! Guess what?’
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Orcutt	“So what do you recommend for ‘richness’?” [MASK] asked her. “The high road of transgression?” The patrician architect was amused by the literature professor and the menacing figure she tried to cut in order to appall the squares. Amused he was.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Merry	he instructed himself. “I cannot let her go! Our life!” And by then [MASK] had seen him, and had it even been possible for him, he did not fall to pieces and run, because it was now too late to run.
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Sheila	“You never told me!” She did not answer. “I could kill you!” he said, and, immediately upon saying it, let her go. “You’ve seen her,” [MASK] said. Her hands neatly folded before her.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Susan	“Did I do the wrong thing? I never touched another person’s mail in my life. But how could I let him send this to [MASK]? Because she won’t keep it to herself. She’ll do what she did the last time.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Mend	“You shouldn’t worry, [MASK]—you still got your build, your looks. You’re amazing. You look great.” He did, too: well tanned, slender, a tall narrow-faced jogger wearing black alligator boots and a black silk shirt beneath a green cashmere jacket.
<name>Quiney</name>	Quiney	Merry	But in the three extra killings he had been confronted by something impossible to regularize, even for him. Being told it was horrible enough, but only by retelling it had he understood how horrible. One plus three. Four. And the instrument of this unblinding is [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mendy	Grandchildren 14, 12, 9, 5, 5, 3.” I wondered if the six grandchildren, including what appeared to be a set of twins, were what made [MASK] so fearful of death or if there were other reasons, like reveling still in whores and sharp clothes.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Dawn	[MASK] overhears things. “Lived here all my life. Never saw anything like this before.” “What can you expect? They have no business being out here to begin with.” “I thought they were nice people, but you never know.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dawnie	I can’t say no.” “Then say one.” “That’s a lie.” “[MASK], it won’t help anything if you say three. One is just the same as three. It gets your point over. Say it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Harry	[MASK] corrected him. “The Star-Eagle." “Right, before it merged with the Ledger." “Wonderful,” the girl said, laughing. “Your father must have been very skilled.”
<name>Orin</name>	Orin	Jerry	He cannot sit there imag- ining the rest of that story. If he hangs up, he will never know what [MASK] has to say after he says all this stuff that he for some reason wants to say about the beast. What beast?
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Eddie	At school they asked if I had brothers or sisters and I wrote ‘None.’ While I was at college, my parents signed some permission form for the nuthouse and they gave [MASK] a lobotomy and he went into a coma and died. Can you imagine?
<name>Kafka</name>	Kafka	Merry	[MASK] wouldn’t see a penny of it. Still, he said yet again—summoning all his strength so as not to lose hold—“I’ve brought the money you requested.” He was trying hard to continue to exist as himself despite the unlikeliness of everything.
<name>Chin</name>	Chin	Buck	“Come on, you’ve been terrific so far. You can keep it up. Come on. [MASK] up.” “I was looking at the snapshots, when she was a baby ...” “Don’t look at them,” he said.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Harry	Now he’s pulling the trank down like that, to the length again—[MASK] likes to bet you that he’ll pull it right down to the pattern without even touching the pattern, but I don’t bet him because I don’t like losing....
<name>Amma</name>	Amma	Jessie	“[MASK] doesn’t usually get all this attention when she goes out. It’s why she doesn’t go out. He’s a very generous man. He doesn’t hold anything back, does he? Nothing left undisclosed. You get the whole person.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Merry	Find a place for [MASK] to live where there is not that underpass. That’s all that matters. Start with the underpass. Save her from getting herself killed in the underpass. Before the morning, before she has even left her room—start there.
<name>Ulysses</name>	Ulysses	Dawnie	He told me the class. I forget it now. Eighteen seventy-nine? I’m full of dates, [MASK]. He told me everything. And all we were doing was walking around a cemetery out back of a church at the top of a hill.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Vicky	For the two worst, most terrifying days, Friday and Saturday, July 14 and 15, 1967, while he kept in touch with the state police on a walkie-talkie and with his father on the phone, [MASK] would not desert him.
<name>MacDuff</name>	MacDuff	Helpern	With Joy [MASK] once again close in my arms and quietly sobbing to hear the old pop tune enjoining all of us sixty-odd-year-olds, “Dream ... and they might come true,” I lifted the Swede up onto the stage.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Merry	He had the money packed into his briefcase, not just the five thousand in the tens and twenties she’d asked for but five thousand more in fifties. A total of ten thousand dollars—and with no idea why. What good would any of it do [MASK]?
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Seymour	And now, four months later, he was at it again. “[MASK], what should I do? He goes around screaming, ‘A second divorce, a second broken family, more grandchildren in a broken home, three more wonderful children without parental guidance.’
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jerry	He comes closest to crying when he tells his brother that she had twice been raped. “Are you done?” asks [MASK]. “What?” “If you’re done, if that’s it, tell me what you are going to do now.
<name>Morwenna</name>	Morwenna	Dawn	The horror of having killed, if only inadvertently, an innocent man, a man as good as any she would ever hope to know, had not taught her anything about that most fundamental prohibition, which, stupefyingly enough, she had failed to learn to observe from being raised by [MASK] and him.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Ira	“Nineteen sixty-nine. Twenty-six years. A long time,” I replied. “To whom? To him? I don’t think so. To the dead,” said [MASK], “it’s a drop in the bucket.”
<name>Wheelwright</name>	Wheelwright	Levovs	Diagonally across the street, alongside where there’d been the wheelwright shop, was the six-room school-house that would be the [MASK]’ daughter’s first school. Kids sat on the steps of the store. Your girl would meet you there.
<name>He's</name>	He's	Miami	Why this occasion for launching his protest at living in the shadow of me? Why, if he had to tell me all this, couldn’t he have told it to me when I was feeling my oats? Why does he even believe he’s in my shadow? [MASK]’s biggest cardiac surgeon!
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Seymour	He’s too tough. I can only lose. We can’t negotiate like this, [MASK]. I don’t want a bar mitzvah. you don’t want a bar mitzvah? With the Torah and all that? that’s right. No. NO?
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Orcutt	He works so hard to be one-dimensional. That Wasp blandness. Living completely off what they once were. The man is simply not there half the time.” Well, [MASK] was there now, right there.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Merry	[MASK] wound up on the platform in her pajamas. “It was absolutely horrendous. The train had already started up. I had to get all our things and throw them all out the window—you know, that’s the way people get out of the train there—and we ran out half dressed.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Swede	Step right up and take a whiff. The swamp. It sucks you in. Smell it, [MASK]. You know what a glove smells like. It smells like the inside of a new car. Well, this is what life smells like. Smell this.
<name>Josephine</name>	Josephine	Merry	[MASK] flitting from floor to floor, so proud and proprietary, flaunting her familiarity with all the employees, unaware as yet of the desecration of dignity inherent to the ruthless exploitation of the worker by the profit-hungry boss who unjustly owns the means of production.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dawn	Fine with me. Hate her all you want,” he said, “but not for something she hasn’t done. She didn’t do it, [MASK]. You are driving yourself crazy with something that cannot be true.” And it wasn’t true.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dawn	Go to where he had never been before. Ecstatically complicitous, he and [MASK]. He had no reason to believe she would ever do it for him, of course, and then one Sunday morning she just did it. He didn’t know what to think.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Merry	He kept such a sharp watch over each and every one of them to be certain that nobody wavered for a moment in their belief in that story. No one in this family was going to fall into doubt about [MASK]’s absolute innocence, not so long as he was alive.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Jerry	No, he is not expecting perfect consolation, but this attack—why is he launching this attack without even the pretext of consoling? Why, when he has just explained to [MASK] how everything has turned out thousands and thousands of times worse than the worst they’d expected?
<name>Chance</name>	Chance	Dawn	How could he allow the unexpected thing back into their lives now that [MASK] had ruled out of their lives forever the improbability of what had happened? Leading his wife back to herself had been like flying them through a five-year storm. He had fulfilled every demand.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Swede	“ You are going to take her away from me? You, who felt sick when you saw her? Sick because she refuses to be captured in your shitty little moral universe? Tell me, [MASK]—how did you get so smart?” He hung up.
<name>For</name>	For	Momentarily	[MASK] it was frightening. This was not anything he had ever worried about for a second, this was a taboo that you didn’t even think of as a taboo, something you are prohibited from doing that felt absolutely natural not to do, you just proceeded effortlessly—and then, however momentary, this.
