<name>John</name>	John	Hosea	She had never seen anything so beautiful. Morning light spilled slowly over the mountains, across the valley to the cabin and the woods behind, and up the hillside. She felt [MASK]’s strong hands on her shoulders.
<name>Mrs. Medlock</name>	Mrs. Medlock	Michael	“What are you doing?” “[MASK], those horrible birds! What are we going to do? They’re eating every seed we planted.” She threw a clod at another bird, and it fluttered off, perching in a nearby tree.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Michael	He drew rein and waited, wondering what she wanted. She was probably going to tell him to bring something back for her with [MASK]’s gold. Or maybe she was going to beg him to leave things alone. Well, let her.
<name>She</name>	She	Angel	“You’re thinking about leaving, aren’t you?” [MASK] glanced up. “Yes.” ‘You’re not happy with the work?” “It’s not the work. It’s...” What could she say? Sighing, she nodded toward the big crate.
<name>him</name>	him	Michael	Did her past show that clearly? Was it emblazoned on her forehead for the whole world to see? Had knowing [MASK] a year made no difference in her at all? Her back stiffened. “As a matter of fact, I was looking for work.”
<name>He</name>	He	Michael	“As soon as you left, things went back to the way they were,” he said, knowing it was a lie. [MASK] had never held a grudge. He was the one who couldn’t let it go. Nothing was the same.
<name>Jesse</name>	Jesse	Michael	“I just wanted to see you leave town with a smile on your face.” “You want to see me smile? Say my name.” “What is your name? I forgot.” He pulled her up off the bed. “[MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Duke	She had never seen him like this before, even that one time when he had lost his temper in the bam. This was not the quiet, patient man she thought she knew. This was a stranger bent on vengeance. She remembered [MASK] lighting his cheroot and broke out in a cold sweat.
<name>her father</name>	her father	Miriam	You rest.” She gave her an impish grin. “When you’re better, well let you do it all by yourself again.” Her mother smiled at the tender teasing. “I’ll get some heavier wood,” [MASK] said and went out.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Michael	[MASK] grinned across the table at him. “Did you tell her to bring you one?” “I didn’t have to. She already had one picked out and packed up, ready to come west.”
<name>John</name>	John	Michael	She couldn’t keep the bitterness from her voice, nor did she try. “So you haven’t forgiven me for that yet?” “I told [MASK] I couldn’t have children and why He said it made no difference to him.” “No?”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Angel	“I told them we’d go for a walk instead.” She lowered her voice so only [MASK] could hear. “One of the disadvantages to having a one room cabin is the lack of privacy.” She leaned her head against the trunk.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Angel	Missing a meal wouldn’t kill her. Three more men gave up on waiting to find out whether food was coming or not. [MASK] and four others remained. The little man appeared again, his smile tense and forced. “We got biscuits and beans.”
<name>Fran</name>	Fran	Angel	“Don’t tell me you can’t. You can. If you don’t know the words, just open your mouth and go ahhhhh. ‘Rock of Ages’ again. You’ve heard it enough to know a few words.” [MASK] joined in hesitantly.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Duke	“Oh, no, [MASK]. 1 carried you with me wherever I went.” She saw his smug smile and added, “What a waste of precious time.” His mouth pressed into a hard line. “I’m going to give you a choice, my dear.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Angel	Just an idiotic child who doesn’t know something precious when it’s staring her right in the face!” Her voice broke, and she hurried away [MASK] fled back to the bam. Clutching the camisole and pantalets, she sat with her back against the wall.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Amanda	“That’s a lie!” “No, it isn’t. It isn’t.” He leaned toward her, but she drew back, hugging herself even more tightly and looking away. “[MASK], we’ll make it through this,” he said.
<name>he</name>	he	Angel	Each time [MASK] saw him, her unrest grew. He talked, and she felt desperation stirring. She knew better than to believe anyone about anything. Hadn’t she learned the hard way? Hope was a dream, and reaching for it turned her life into an unbearable nightmare.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Angel	The merchandise on the table he chose had to be moved, too. She did as he said, feeling more and more tense as the day went on. Get out of here, [MASK]. Go. Now.
<name>Joffrey</name>	Joffrey	Satan	“Just say yes.” She would agree to wed [MASK] himself if it would get her out of the Palace. “Why not?” she managed. She drifted on a sea of pain and quiet voices. The room was full of them.
<name>Maui</name>	Maui	Michael	It was the same soft voice she had heard in [MASK]’s cabin. The one she’d heard in her dream.... Be still, for I am here. She looked around, but only her guard and the performers were there.
<name>Belle</name>	Belle	Angel	A couple of buildings were still in business. One was a big saloon. [MASK] knew if she walked through those swinging doors, she would be working in one of those upstairs rooms within the hour. Aimlessly, she continued down the street. What was she going to do?
<name>John</name>	John	Michael	Very easily.” He tapped his fingertips together. She stared at those aristocratic hands, hands without calluses, pale and manicured. Beautifully shaped hands that were capable of unspeakable cruelty She remembered [MASK]’s hands, large and strong, clearly used to hard labor.
<name>He</name>	He	Michael	Then it will be even worse. “I have to talk to you,” she said weakly. All she could hear was the pounding of her heart in her own ears and that dark voice driving her on in desperation. [MASK] frowned slightly.
<name>Midwife</name>	Midwife	Elizabeth	A few moments later, with the last contractions, she relaxed completely exhausted. “Tie the cord with the twine before you cut it,” [MASK] said wearily and smiled. “He has good lungs.” “Yes, he certainly does.”
<name>John</name>	John	Michael	On his way out of town, [MASK] drove by the brothel. It was big and fancy. The place was overflowing with men—mostly young, some bewhiskered and some smooth-cheeked—nearly all drunk or well on their way to being so.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Michael	How do I convince her there are good people in the world when everyone she has ever known used her and then condemned her for it? [MASK] lifted a strand of her pale hair and rubbed it between his fingers. He hadn’t made love to her since bringing her home.
<name>he</name>	he	Michael	She would never understand him. She had thought men like him were weak, but [MASK] wasn’t. He was quiet and steady, unyielding, like a rock. How could he still look at her with anything but loathing after all she had done?
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	A month of blissful happiness and he could feel her drawing away from him again. He was afraid. [MASK], don’t let her pull away from me again. Help me hold onto her. “Come here,” he said, putting a blanket before the fireplace.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Angel	[MASK] drew away slightly and stared up again. She wished she hadn’t brought up the subject. “Whatever you say. You’re the expert.” He smiled. “I studied the Scripture before we were together that first time.” She glanced at him in surprise.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Angel	[MASK] threw her napkin down. “Look! I don’t ask names. I don’t care who they are. 1 give them what they want, and they leave. That’s it.” “Then why does he keep coming back?”
<name>He</name>	He	Rab	“What’s her name?” he asked without taking his eyes from her. [MASK]’s mouth opened slightly and he looked dumbfounded. “I dunno.” He gave an uneasy, befuddled laugh, clearly drunk. “What did her mother call her?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Paul	[MASK] smiled wryly. “Thanks.” He fell into step beside him. “It wasn’t anything like I expected out there.” “No pot at the end of the rainbow?” “Not even a rainbow.” He was feeling better already.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Jonathan	You would believe it.” She shook her cape out and hung it up, tossing her bonnet on top with a careless air. [MASK] noticed the difference in her immediately. Her face was aglow, and the smile she wore was one of joy.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Sarah	Her eyes were bright and her cheeks full of lively color. She smiled as she folded the letter and tucked it into her sleeve. She stood and came to [MASK], lifting her and swinging her around gaily. “Thank you for getting the flowers, darling.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Angel	“By the way,” she added, tossing weeds into the bucket. “I wouldn’t be so embarrassed about your unmentionables.” At [MASK]’s startled response, she laughed. ‘You should see mine!”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Leah	he asked, knowing perfectly well she could make it down on her own. “This would make a great swing tree,” [MASK] said, climbing down next to him. “See that big fat branch? You could tie the rope right there.”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Joseph	“I’ve put up the ounce of gold a time or two to get my name in a hat,” [MASK] said over his shoulder. “That was before I found out it took more than that just to get your name in the right hat.”
<name>He</name>	He	Paul	Run away to your mountains and your gold panning.” She slammed the door behind her. [MASK] sat motionless, shattered. He wanted to go after her and explain, but what could he say? That he was in love with her and it was driving him mad?
<name>Prospector</name>	Prospector	Paul	[MASK] grimaced. “Dismal and cold. ” “Did you find what you were looking for?” “If there’s gold in them thar hills, I never saw much of it. What I found was barely enough to keep body and soul together.”
<name>Mr. Chang</name>	Mr. Chang	Duke	Breathing slowly, she forced herself to remain calm as she sat. “You must be famished,” he said and pulled the bell cord. The Chinese servant entered with a tray. As soon as it was placed on the table before her, [MASK] waved him out.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Miriam	And give him the children I can’t.” [MASK] let go in shock. Her face went fiery red and then white. “No. Oh, no!” She started running after the coach, but it was picking up speed and not slowing down.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Miriam	It would keep him from looking for her. Only she need know that she would never go back to prostitution. Even if it meant starving to death. [MASK] argued and pleaded all the way to the road and only stopped because she was finally out of breath.
<name>James Bond</name>	James Bond	Michael	“He came to the Palace.” “Don’t make me laugh! [MASK] wouldn’t set foot in that stink hole. He doesn’t drink and he doesn’t gamble, and he’s sure never consorted with prostitutes.” She smiled, taunting.
<name>John</name>	John	Michael	The next morning, she saw a flock of birds in the wheat field. Dropping the water bucket, she ran into the field to chase them away Laughing, [MASK] rested his arms on the corral fence he was fixing and watched. “What are you doing?”
<name>He</name>	He	Duchess	She cupped her hands and made a shape. “A sack about this big is all I expect. One of the men you sent my way last night was an accountant, and he made a few calculations for me.” [MASK] glared at her.
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Bonnie	She gave up marrying a fine young man because her father was ill and needed her. She nursed the old miser for fifteen years before he died. He wasn’t even cold in his grave when my loving mother dumped me on her doorstep with a note. It said, ‘This is [MASK].’
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Angel	You’ll get room, board, clothes, whatever you want. I’ll take good care of you.” The shaking began inside her again. [MASK] cupped the glass of whiskey between her hands and stared bleakly into the amber liquid. All her prospects were gone.
<name>John</name>	John	Miriam	He let out his breath sharply. “[MASK], I wanted to hit him.” He clenched his fist. “1 wanted to shake him. He was praying when I got there. Down on his knees in the bam, praying for her.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Angel	“No need,” [MASK] said. “My mother didn’t worship any idols that I remember, but she prayed a lot.” Not that it ever did her any good. “What’d she pray for?”
<name>Wyatt</name>	Wyatt	Angel	I think it’s just going to take time. It’s going to take us getting to know one another better. It’s going to take trust.” [MASK] stared up at the star-studded sky. “I knew soiled doves who fell in love.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Michael	“What are you doing to yourself?” “I have to wash. You didn’t give me the chance—” “You’ve washed enough.” He tried to put the jacket around her, and she pulled away “I’m not clean yet, [MASK].
<name>London</name>	London	Michael	Something squeezed tight inside her at the thought of leaving [MASK]. She forced herself to think instead of the satisfaction she would feel when she faced the Duchess again and demanded her money. She could always enlist the bartender’s help if she had to.
<name>John</name>	John	Steven	He wasn’t going to be a rich man’s pastor. Apparently one night a man was being badly beaten in an alley, and [MASK] tried to stop it. He was stabbed to death.” Her face jerked, and she bit her lip.
<name>She</name>	She	Angel	He made his apologies and said supplies were low. [MASK] couldn’t eat, anyway She tried, but the food stuck in her throat. She sipped the coffee instead and tried to drown her fear, but it was there like a hard knot inside her chest.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Michael	“Let go of me!” She struggled frantically. [MASK] saw she was hurting herself and released her. She stepped well away from him. “Did all that make you feel any better?” “Yes!” she hissed, lying through her teeth.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Hosea	And she had no tears, not anymore. [MASK] perplexed her. “I’ve done everything for you but the one thing I know best.” She searched his eyes. “Why not?” His expression changed, and she felt a softening toward him.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Michael	The man had never set foot in a brothel in his life. He had never had a woman. Not that the chance hadn’t been presented often enough. Against all reason and natural drives, [MASK] had set his mind to wait for the right one.
<name>He</name>	He	John	The sooner he got out of here the better. Frowning, [MASK] looked at his wife. “Let me think about it. I’ll let you know by the end of the week.” Three more days. Could he stand three more days?
<name>Almanzo</name>	Almanzo	Michael	“Forget I mentioned her.” He followed [MASK] outside and watched him jump up onto his wagon. “Town got a pastor just last Wednesday. If you’ve a mind to hear him, he’s preaching at the Gold Nugget Saloon.”
<name>She</name>	She	Angel	I’m out of business.” He walked to the front door, flipped the sign over and put his forehead against the wall. [MASK] felt sorry for him. She knew what it was like to be down on her luck. “Should I leave?”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Sarah	[MASK] finally saw the sea. There was garbage floating in it. But still she liked it very much. Sometimes she would go down and sit on the wharf. She liked the salt smell and the ships coming in loaded with cargo.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Michael	He didn’t even see the fist coming. He didn’t even know what happened. Pain spread along his jaw, and he was lying on his back, [MASK] standing over him, fists clenched, face livid.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Michael	And if this man figured he could make her.. .She had learned early that what you don’t believe in can’t hurt you. “Do you remember anything about the wedding?” [MASK] said, startling her from her grim thoughts.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Michael	What could she say? Sighing, she nodded toward the big crate. “[MASK]’s stove. He’ll come for it soon.” “And you don’t want to see him?” “I can’t.” “Was it so terrible?”
<name>Him</name>	Him	Michael	He opened her mind to things she hadn’t noticed before. And a quiet voice in her head said over and over, Come forth, beloved Come forth from what? She couldn’t get enough of [MASK]. He filled her mind and heart. He was her life.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Paul	“When are you going to open your eyes?” “When are you?” [MASK] shot back. “If she loved you, don’t you think she’d stay? You wouldn’t be able to drive her out.
<name>she</name>	she	Miriam	What was the use? She would only leave again. And again and again. Couldn’t [MASK] understand? Once a prostitute, always a prostitute. Apparently, some truths came too hard for a girl as sweet and naive as his wife.
<name>they</name>	they	Miriam	If he had reached out just once as [MASK] had said, maybe things would have been different, but he had been too proud, too sure he was right. “I’m sorry,” he said. “So very sorry. Can you forgive me?”
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Sarah	[MASK] feels it, too. She asked me about it once, and I told her we were different from other people. 1 didn’t know what else to say” Her voice broke. “I’ll probably go to hell for what I’ve become.”
<name>Mrs. Hirsch</name>	Mrs. Hirsch	Virgil	“She could have had a job with [MASK] if she had known how to cook. As it is, he was kind enough to let her stay if I’d go down and work with her for the next few weeks until she knows what to do.
<name>Ygritte</name>	Ygritte	Angel	“Stop running from me!” [MASK] wanted to cry out, “Not from you! From this. From the mindless, selfish grasping for pleasure. Theirs and yours, not mine. Never mine.” But she didn’t. Instead she challenged him in anger.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Henri	Her courage faltered. “No.” “You hungry? [MASK] just put something together for the Duchess.” Maybe food would staunch the queasiness. She nodded, and he left the glasses and went out the door at the end of the bar.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Michael	[MASK] sank the ax deeply into the log. It went straight through and imbedded in the block. He gave it a hard tug and freed the blade again. He set up another log and split it with one swing.
<name>He</name>	He	Michael	She was working in the garden when [MASK] returned. She made no move to go out to meet him. He swung down from his horse and strode toward her purposefully. Putting his hand on the support post, he swung over the gate and caught hold of her.
<name>they</name>	they	Michael	She made the bed, washed the dishes and put them away, and shook out the hearth rug. The flowers were still fresh. She banked the fire so that it would still be going when [MASK] returned home. She jumped when someone tapped at the door.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Michael	He was so close, she could see his eyes. Oh...“God, let me die. Let me die for him/’ No, came a soft voice. She looked up and saw [MASK] standing before her. A small flame burned where his heart was.
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Torie	Warmth filled her, then a burst of energy and assurance such as she had never experienced before. She reached out quickly and stopped [MASK]. “Have lunch with me,” she said, so excited she was trembling. “Me?”
<name>today</name>	today	Priss	He laughed softly and kissed her forehead. “I don’t really know, my love.” “But you don’t drink or gamble,” she said. “Whatever possessed you?” “It was a strange day [MASK]. Something gnawed at me from noon on.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Mae	“You’ll be pleased. I swear. She’s a good kid. Looks like [MASK]. Pretty Real pretty. And smart.” She was relieved when he opened the door. He wasn’t drunk, just lightly in his cups, his eyes bright and merry.
<name>Nina</name>	Nina	Priss	She was so young, and she walked to the center of that stage with such quiet dignity. You can’t even imagine it, [MASK]. Those men, they were like all the hounds of hell baying at her. And then she sang.
<name>The fear</name>	The fear	Duke	[MASK] was right. It was insidious. It was a trap. It grew like ivy, forcing its way into the smallest cracks of her defenses, and eventually it would rip her apart. If she let it. If she didn’t kill it now.
<name>Aunt Em</name>	Aunt Em	Cleo	“Hush that noise! My heavens, what is the ruckus all about?” [MASK] said, hurrying toward her. “One would think you were a chicken without your head the way you’re running about.” “Where were you?”
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Ruth	“It has to come from inside, and I don’t have anything left inside.” “Really?” [MASK] said, amazed. “How did that happen?” “It all just drained out.”
<name>she</name>	she	Paul	She couldn’t understand his animosity. “But why shouldn’t he, [MASK]? She’s his wife, and he still loves her.” His face set in hard lines. “A wife? Can’t you see what she’s done to him?”
<name>Monica</name>	Monica	Angel	“No. I’m quite serious.” She rested her hands on the box. “I know it sounds ridiculous, but it works. I’m a fixer, [MASK]. A worrier. I’ve never been able to just let things go.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Rab	He shrugged. “She ain’t mine anyway. Is he here? The big man, I mean.” “He will be shortly, and you’ll keep your mouth shut if you’ve any sense in your head.” [MASK] headed for the stairs.
<name>he</name>	he	Michael	I don’t know if 1 can go through this. I have not given you a heart of fear. She knew the moment [MASK] saw her. He glanced up as she was crossing the meadow. He stood very still, staring at her in the distance.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Paul	If he had hit her back once, he would have killed her. He had almost gone out of his mind when she left him. He searched on foot until he found the wagon marks and realized what had happened. She had left with [MASK].
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Michael	He cupped her face. “Look at me. Say it again.” “[MASK].” Was he satisfied now? She waited for his triumphant grin and instead saw his adoring eyes and heard his tender voice. “Keep on saying it....”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Michael	“I’m sure you two have lots to talk about.” She looked right at him before she went out the door. It struck him like a blow in the face. She doesn’t even care if I tell him. [MASK] was looking at him solemnly.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Susanna	“I can’t stay here and live off your family for the rest of my life.” “You won’t.” “It’s been six months, [MASK], and I’m no closer to knowing what I should do than I was the night I came here.”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Stella	A woman in a thin wrapper answered his knock. Her curly brown hair fell about her pale shoulders and she had circles beneath her hazel eyes. “I need your help, [MASK].” After he explained all, she frowned and chewed on her lower lip.
<name>He</name>	He	Paul	Her whole body was shaking with her sobs. [MASK] stared down at them and felt a stab of pain go through his middle. This was what he wanted, wasn’t it? This was what he had planned.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Paul	Her throat closed, and she smiled. Another burden lifted, and she was grateful, but it wasn’t that easy or simple. She couldn’t let it be. “I can’t go back, [MASK]. Not ever.” “Why not?”
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Michael	She got up and turned her back on him. Pushing the lace curtains back from the window, she looked down at the busy city street. V/hat’s happened to all the fine moral strength I possessed while I was with you, [MASK]?
<name>someone</name> (There is no specific name given in the passage)	someone (There is no specific name given in the passage)	Michael	The only thing that came to mind was going back to what she knew. Every time she passed a brothel, she knew she could walk in the door and have food and shelter. She could have physical comfort. All she had to do was sell her body again—and betray [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mara	“What are you really afraid of, [MASK]? Why don’t we get down to that?” She threw the buttonhook aside and straightened. “I’m not afraid of anything, least of all a dirt farmer like you.” He opened the door.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jacob	You’ve never climbed a tree in your life.” She grinned mischievously “It’s about time you did.” “You pulled her up by yourself? She might have been hurt.” “We helped,” [MASK] said, coming down from a higher branch.
<name>Aladdin</name>	Aladdin	Michael	He sat waiting for her impatiently. She winced as she climbed up onto the wagon seat with him. “How’d you meet [MASK]?” he said as he snapped the reins and they started off again. “He came to the Palace.”
