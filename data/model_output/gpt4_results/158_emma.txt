<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but [MASK] only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very little.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	poor [MASK]!” She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved. Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Frank	Do not defer it. What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, [MASK]; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided.
<name>Weston</name>	Weston	Weston	“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair, however. [MASK] may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hetty	I hope you find a chair. I wish [MASK] had not gone. I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I am sure she will be here presently.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you.” [MASK] submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love.
<name>Woodhouse</name>	Woodhouse	Woodhouse	I must order the carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.” “I am,”--she answered--“I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss [MASK], we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Isabella	A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed [MASK]'s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear [MASK]--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.” “Ah! you will never guess. You, (to [MASK]), I am certain, will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.” “I do remember it,” cried [MASK]; “I perfectly remember it.--Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	But [MASK], in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK] recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off. “Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried [MASK] warmly, and taking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted even--”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--” She paused a few moments. [MASK] could not speak.
<name>Highbury</name>	Highbury	Highbury.--“He	He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on [MASK] did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same.
<name>Donwell</name>	Donwell	Donwell	She had no objection. She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers. Her eyes were towards [MASK] as she walked, but she saw him not. “The ladies were all at home.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jane	I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.” “My dear [MASK], say no more about it.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know _that_ is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as [MASK] is exactly what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:--“one can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear [MASK], I am longing to talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	The superior degree of confidence towards [MASK], which this one article marked, gave her severe pain. On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a little reflection, venture the following question.
<name>Woodhouse</name>	Woodhouse	Woodhouse	She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone, “This is most kind, indeed!--Miss [MASK], it is impossible for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely without words.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK]'s answer was ready at the first word. “While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this answer, however, was admitted.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made [MASK] acquainted with the whole.
<name>James</name>	James	James	We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that [MASK] will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. [MASK] returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret-- “I am glad I have done being in love with him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	Which of them is it?--I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.” “Upon my word, [MASK].”-- “Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing [MASK] again. “This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.” The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency. [MASK] was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon now.” She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of [MASK]'s wondering questions.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Harriet	Do you think I am right?” “Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest [MASK]; you are doing just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Jane	Towards the end of [MASK]'s second song, her voice grew thick. “That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--“you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.” Another song, however, was soon begged for.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, [MASK] guessed to be good behaviour to his father. “I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.-- “I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that [MASK], accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.
<name>Perry</name>	Perry	Perry	A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have consulted [MASK].”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Frank	He had done his duty and could return to his son. “When [MASK] left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has been completely unexpected.
<name>serle</name>	serle	Serle	They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as [MASK] boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	what she should do.--” [MASK] was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful. “Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK], alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to [MASK], said, “Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might expect.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true. 'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily, but you, [MASK].”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	I will have nothing to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.” “I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said [MASK], contemplating the letter.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	He is an excellent young man, and will suit [MASK] exactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jane	Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist; but [MASK] is taking them in.” “What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all in the street.
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Jane	we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, [MASK], take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“[MASK]!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”--but checking himself--“No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Knightley!--There	qualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--not in the least.--Poor [MASK] would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him!
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Highbury	“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?” “Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended.” “Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.” “[MASK] gossips!--Tiresome wretches!”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more, and [MASK] hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	but I cannot admit him to be [MASK]'s equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK] was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them. “Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	She had no doubt of [MASK]'s happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and improvement.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear [MASK], suppose we all have a little gruel.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.” [MASK] was silent.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	She now resolved to keep [MASK] no longer in the dark. She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.” It would be impossible to say what [MASK] felt, on hearing this--which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	With the view of passing off an awkward moment, [MASK] smilingly said, “You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Hartfield	Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to [MASK] as you apprehended; and now you have
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jane	As the door opened she was heard, “So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And [MASK] declares--Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	It confesses that you have long understood me.” “No, sir,” cried [MASK], “it confesses no such thing. So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	“Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and she came in his way.” “I dare say,” returned [MASK], sighing again, “I dare say she was very much attached to him.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you.” [MASK] could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not speak.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that [MASK] would not forget what was due--or rather what would be kind by me.” This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	His dejection was most evident. He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say, “Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.” “But you will come again,” said [MASK].
<name>Flattery</name>	Flattery	Vanity	You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. [MASK] working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK] made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of [MASK], in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so.” “There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear [MASK]. I have a very strong notion that it comes from him.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	but herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible, and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If [MASK], from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too. CHAPTER XII
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, [MASK], by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave her out.” [MASK] denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Emma	You and I, [MASK], will venture to take the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jane	I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading [MASK]'s letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	simpleton	“Yes, [MASK] as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK] saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question-- “She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	not she very charming?” There was a little hesitation in [MASK]'s answer. “Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.” “I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.” “Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”
<name>Elinor</name>	Elinor	Emma	“Poor girl!” said [MASK]. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?” “Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself. '
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK] then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied, “Never marry!--This is a new resolution.” “It is one that I shall never change, however.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and [MASK], eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Emma	He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into 'poor [MASK]' with him at once.--His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	[MASK] was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father began his inquiries.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	“If I know myself, [MASK], mine is an active, busy mind, with a great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	“My dear [MASK], I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jane	[MASK] very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold. “Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Harriet	Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on [MASK]'s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. [MASK] could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bella	“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little [MASK]'s throat.” “Oh!
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jane	They were both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of [MASK]; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“Has he been here on this occasion--or has he not?” “He has not been here yet,” replied [MASK]. “There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my dear [MASK], there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	I think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, [MASK]. You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.” “I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	No, she had heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away. “If we were in the other room,” said [MASK], “if I had my writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said [MASK]. “As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	“Here,” resumed [MASK], turning to her box again, “here is something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a [MASK]! Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a pleasure.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Emma	I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.” “I am very much obliged to you,” said [MASK], laughing again.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Harriet	It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance--! After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than [MASK]'s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.
<name>Elton</name>	Elton	Elton	“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.--Mr. [MASK] was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now.”-- “Well, go on.” “Oh! that's all.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, [MASK], it would not have been taken with such indifference.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emma	After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with, “I have something to tell you, [MASK]; some news.” “Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.
