<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nnaife	Then she stopped short, for right there in front of her, just a few feet away from where she stood on the wet grass, was [MASK], stooping in his work, his concentration so deep that the song he was whistling was completely tuneless.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Oshia	“I’m not going! I am a boy. Why should I help in the cooking? That’s a woman’s job,” [MASK] yelled back, and went on playing with his friends. All the people sitting around in the compound laughed.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Nnaife	She noticed that [MASK] was beginning to refer to them as her children, whom she had borne to kill him before his time. His anger grew when he knew that it was going to take a longer time for him to be granted his retirement pension than he had expected.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nnaife	“Go and get a job, you! Who is your father that you can come here and beat me, just because we are far away from anywhere?” [MASK] did not chase her. He sagged down on a chair rubbing his shoulder.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Adim	Say four to five years after that.. . then I shall be able to do something for them. Not now.” [MASK] opened his mouth and closed it again, swallowing the night air. “What of me, what will become of me?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nnaife	He would be laughing one minute, then start to whisper like a child the next. There was one thing that did not change with [MASK] and that was his lack of judgement. Now that he had money, it had to be spent.
<name>Yonggang</name>	Yonggang	Nnaife	Had her belly really become bigger? She could not tell for sure. The more positive she became, the more afraid she was. Her husband [MASK] would get up at six in the morning by the clock the master and his wife had given him.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Nnaife	“The shop steward came to me just by the road there, to say that she is repentant and that she admits she was in the wrong.” The others laughed again. “You mean they have given up so soon?” [MASK] shook his head.
<name>Amaka</name>	Amaka	Agunwa	The funeral dancing and feasting started very early in the morning and went on throughout the day. Different groups of people came and went and had to be entertained. In the evening it was time to put [MASK] in her grave.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Adim	[MASK]’s schoolwork began to suffer and the boy was losing weight. It was true what they said, she thought, that if you don’t have children the longing for them will kill you, and if you do, the worrying over them will kill you.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nnaife	“Listen, old boy,” the man called to one of his friends. [MASK], catching the word “boy”, thought he was being addressed and replied, “Yessir! ” This amused the man and he laughed, throwing his cap behind his head.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	Nnaife	They looked at the pathetic figure of [MASK] sitting there, being responsible for all these children. Even the judge looked at him with a kind of masculine admiration. “Your husband is a very strong man,” the prosecuting lawyer said cynically and the court roared in laughter.
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Agbadi	That night, after she had given [MASK] his meal and helped his men rub life into his stiff side and shoulder, she curled up to him and asked: “Would you like me to go now? My father will be worrying, wondering what your people are saying.”
<name>Nnu</name>	Nnu	Nnaife	She was being shaken by someone. It was [MASK]’s brother. “New wife, what is all this shouting for? You are having a bad dream. Wake up, wake up, it is only a dream.” She opened her eyes, startled.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Adim	‘‘That butcher and his son — I will teach them! My daughter! ” His family could not hold him. He was so wild, he was so determined. [MASK] somehow guessed where he was going, though how he knew was something of a miracle.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Abby	It is better to lose respect among people who do not know who you are; don’t do it nearer home or it will rebound on your people. You must work partly for your keep, helping [MASK] to clean his shoes, wash his new motor cycle. .
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Agbadi	[MASK] lay silently on his back on the goatskin, sometimes gazing at the bamboo ceiling, sometimes letting out grunts in agreement with the many prayers being said. For most of the time his eyes were closed, and the sweat on his matted chest had to be mopped with cold water time and time again.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Agbadi	[MASK] smiled contentedly and invited everybody in his own compound to drink. “My daughter has been found an unspoiled virgin. Her husband’s people are here to thank us.” Each visitor would peep into the kegs of palm wine and shout, “Oh, the kegs are very full.
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Nnaife	“Yes,” she replied in the cultured, distant voice which she invariably used when addressing the native servants. “Yes, [MASK], I shall not need you till the morning. Good night.” “Good night, madam. Good night, sah.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Oshia	After all, they still had enough money to pay for the rent. She also made sure of another term’s fees for [MASK]. She was now able to have a modest permanent stall of her own, at the railway yard, instead of spreading her wares on the pavement outside the yard.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Abby	[MASK] will not be back until three this afternoon. If we hurry now, we shall soon be back.” They were not kept waiting long, even though there were many families there. They were handed an envelope with several peculiar stamps fixed to it.
<name>James</name>	James	Nnaife	[MASK] was given a generous reference: it said he was a devoted servant, that he knew how to bleach sheets white, knew the correct amount of blue to add to a shirt and that he never overstarched his master’s khaki shorts.
<name>Ekwefi</name>	Ekwefi	Adaku	All the people sitting around in the compound laughed. “Just like a boy,” they murmured amusedly. But that childish remark set [MASK] off. She started to cry afresh for her dead baby, certain that people were mocking her because she had no son.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Agbadi	Not knowing she was being watched, she put the child to her breasts. The next thing she felt was a double blow from behind. She almost died of shock to see her husband there. The child was snatched from her, and her father [MASK] was summoned.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Na	One of them said, “Fancy threatening someone with the Lagos police, when a pound given to the right person would set you free anyway.” They laughed again. “No, no, sah! No police, sah! [MASK] work me de find.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nnaife	After recovering from the initial shock of his wife and family getting rich through his going to fight for the white man, [MASK] wanted to know how often this payment would be made. He was informed that it would be about two to four times in the year.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Adaku	When we go to the market, we have to keep wandering from stall to stall in search of bargains, because we can never afford anything,” [MASK] said breathlessly. “Is this the only way you could tell me about it?
<name>Elayne</name>	Elayne	Ona	“We did not force you. remember,” [MASK] said, anger rising in her. “Is it my fault that you decided to treat me as a wife and not a lover? You knew of my father’s determination before you came to me.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Nwakusor	She looked away, her hands shakily stringing the beads she was going to tie as decorations round the twins’ legs. “The food money you give us is too small. [MASK] and the other men give their wives double the amount you give us.
<name>He</name>	He	Ubani	“I wonder where my wife is at the moment — away to sell at the market, perhaps?” It was more a remark to elicit reassurance than a question. [MASK] said nothing, just went on briskly towards the house, his head bowed.
<name>Ezinma</name>	Ezinma	Agbadi	This is the age of the white man. Nowadays every young man wants to cement his mud hut and cover it with corrugated-iron sheets instead of the palm leaves we are used to. You’ll just have to accept a man of today, [MASK].”
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Oshia	So learn as much as you can from school, because when they demand the next school fees, I don’t think I shall be able to pay.” [MASK] looked the image of dejection and cried: “But I love school. Mother.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ubani	[MASK] guessed what he was thinking from his keenness and smiled sadly. He might have laughed but for the unsavoury task ahead of him. All young people were the same: they never imagined they would get old. Why, not so long ago he had thought that way himself.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Nnaife	The woman looked up and asked, “Are you all right, [MASK]’s wife? Why do you look at me like that? I am not your enemy, eh? Why are you looking at me like that, as if you don’t want to see me?
<name>Yashim</name>	Yashim	Agbadi	What else do you expect? Is it her fault that you have no son?” [MASK] was beginning to roar like the wild animals he was wont to hunt and kill. “Please, please, aren’t you two happy that I have survived the birth?
<name>Mugo</name>	Mugo	Cordelia	He could see no sign of her. He saw [MASK] standing between the wooden poles that held the veranda roof up, looking at them rather speculatively. “I wonder where my wife is at the moment — away to sell at the market, perhaps?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Nwakusor	She must go and put her house in order, prepare the midday meal. Three months after [MASK] had rescued her from the Carter Bridge, she found it so much easier to dream of all that might have been than of what might still happen.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oshia	and kept telling [MASK] to be a big boy, because now he was the big brother. He hated the “big brother” part of the whole thing, and the fact that his mother and her friends were making such a fuss over this tiny brother of his.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Nnaife	After five years of living with him, she was used to him; listening in the dark to his snores, she coiled inside with shame, remembering some of the evil things she had once thought of [MASK]. Her new Christian religion taught her to bear her cross with fortitude.
<name>Antanas</name>	Antanas	Agbadi	She was softer and plumper, and relaxed and happy. Her good humour returned and when her peals of laughter rang out [MASK] would jump up from where he was usually lying, thinking that her mother, his Ona, had come back to him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ato	“Then take that mad look from your face, and let it go for ever. Do you want me to leave?” “Oh, [MASK], I am glad you came. I thought I was hearing things. I did not know that you were back yet.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Nnaife	No wonder she was pregnant again so soon after the twins, because she knew how to sneak behind people’s backs and make up to [MASK]. “Wait until that man returns,” she vowed to herself, “I shall give him a piece of my tongue.”
<name>He</name>	He	Nnaife	But had she been right? [MASK] had looked at her with so much venom that she knew that when it neared the time of his release, if she was still alive, she would find a way to live with her own people.
<name>Ezinma</name>	Ezinma	Ona	Having died a “complete woman”, she was to be buried in her husband’s compound. “Make sure that her slave and her cooking things go with her. We must all mourn her.” [MASK] moved about like a quiet wife.
<name>Snitterfield</name>	Snitterfield	Nnaife	The only money he had ever handled before was in coin, and he knew that somehow you could make a penny go further by changing it into four farthings. [MASK] chortled loudly. “Now you must carry your strike to the bitter end.
<name>He</name>	He	Nnaife	He soon stopped thinking about the incident and later when people talked about it he was not quite sure that he was not in the wrong. But [MASK] gained the reputation of a master musician whose music could move even the spirits.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Nnaife	[MASK] was wide awake now, staring at the ceiling of their one-room home. This aspect of his wife’s trade was illegal and could land her in trouble if she were caught. But what was he to do? Ask her to stay?
<name>Adaku</name>	Adaku	Agunwa	He soon went into a trance and began to speak in a far-off voice, strange and unnatural: “This child is the slave woman who died with your senior wife [MASK]. She promised to come back as a daughter. Now here she is.
<name>Equiano</name>	Equiano	Nnaife	They were paid — paid slaves — but the amount was so ridiculously small that many a white Christian with a little conscience would wonder whether it was worth anybody’s while to leave a wife and family and stay almost a year on a voyage. Yet [MASK] was delighted.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Adaku	“I’m not sorry for what we did,” [MASK] said. “I’m not saying that I’m sorry. All I’m saying is that we can’t carry on this way and let the children starve.” “He wouldn’t let us starve.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Oshia	None of them was well dressed. [MASK] wore his khaki school pants, with one of his mother’s butterfly-patterned lappa cloths wound round him and tied in a neat knot at the back of his neck; most of the other boys were similarly clothed.
<name>Yejide</name>	Yejide	Amatokwu	Remember how you used to want me here with only the sky for our shelter? What happened to us. [MASK]? Is it my fault that I did not have a child for you? Do you think I don’t suffer too?”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Ubani	“Oh, my God! Poor woman. She endures me only because of this child, you know. She thinks I’m ugly. She hates me, she has always hated me.” “Nonsense, my friend,” [MASK] tried to console him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Agbadi	“Well, it is true. What are you going to say to your father?” “Oh, please, [MASK], don’t take my joy away. You know I like staying here with you, but I am my father’s daughter.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nevertheless	Do you know what you are doing?” [MASK] she went up to the front, to the envious glances of the other passengers. “Mothers come first,” said the driver with an exaggerated show of courtesy. “She is your mother, is she not?
<name>Amadioha</name>	Amadioha	Agbadi	She went from one dibia to another in secret, and was told the same thing — that the slave woman who was her chi would not give her a child because she had been dedicated to a river goddess before [MASK] took her away in slavery.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Oshia	[MASK] was so overjoyed that he piled several spoonfuls of the rice into the empty tomato pur6e tins his mother had used making the stew and took them to show magnanimously to his friends. “It’s like Christmas,” he boasted to his schoolmates the next oay.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nnaife	It was comparatively easy when there was no war; one could always be a domestic servant. Now with the war, the masters were at the front fighting. Money was short and so were jobs. And in [MASK]’s family there were many more mouths being added to those to be fed.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Amatokwu	This one worked himself into an animal passion. She was sure he had never seen a woman before. She bore it, and relaxed as she had been told, pretending that the person lying on her was [MASK], her first sweetheart of a husband.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Nnaife	Some boys from nearby St Gregory’s school came to do the job, but one look at [MASK]’s bloodshot eyes sent them scurrying like a group of frightened mice, and from a distance they taunted him and called him “grandad the ball-picker”.
<name>Adaku</name>	Adaku	Ona	Since he has not taken a bride price from you, do you think it would be right for me to stay with you permanently? You know our custom does not permit it. I am still my father’s daughter,” [MASK] intoned sadly.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oshia	Many a time [MASK] would look at his father and wonder whether those things were part of the art of becoming a man. He soon stopped thinking about the incident and later when people talked about it he was not quite sure that he was not in the wrong.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Cordelia	If you are going to be my wife, you must accept my work, my way of life. I will not have it any other way. You must understand that. So go out and gossip with [MASK], and let me finish my food in peace.”
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Taiwo	“That will be a good idea. But you and your sister will have to water it during the day.” “The boys can help too,” grumbled [MASK] the other twin, known in the family as the moaner.
<name>Whitemen</name>	Whitemen	Christians	She tried desperately to control her feelings, to put on a pleasant face, to be the sophisticated Ibuza wife and welcome another woman into her home; but she could not. She hated this thing called the European way; these people called [MASK] taught that a man must marry only one wife.
<name>Yakubu</name>	Yakubu	Agbadi	Some days when he could not come to her, she knew he was with his other wives. Being [MASK], however, he never talked about them to her, and she respected him for it. It was on such a night that she came into labour.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Adaku	Tired of sitting, [MASK] got up and asked in tones of mock politeness, “Would you like me to take his food indoors? He can hardly eat out here on the veranda now, in this darkness.” “Yes, please take it in.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Agbadi	She did not tell anyone that [MASK] had regained consciousness; she watched hopefully, yet with fear, for further signs of recovery. That evening while she was trying to ease the bamboo splints that had been fixed to straighten his shoulder, two men had to hold his strong long legs to prevent him from kicking.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ona	“What is the matter with her? She was all right last night.” Momentarily he forgot himself and made as if to get up; [MASK]. wide awake now, restrained him. “Damn this shoulder,” he grumbled.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Adaku	“Well, if you’re going to stand there and stare at me. I’ll just step into your veranda and wait for my cousin [MASK].” The woman mounted the two cement steps and looked round for a chair. There was none.
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Oshia	Whenever his mother started to cry, [MASK], realising that she took his asking for something in particular as a sign that he was improving, did his best to put on a steady voice and say, “Mother, please give me some water. I’m thirsty.”
<name>Felicity</name>	Felicity	Ngozi	A kind of life seemed to be forced into him with that statement. “Yes, where is my wife, and where is [MASK]?” he asked eventually, waking up from his dream and wanting to know which part of it was actually real.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Oshia	There was nothing I could do to amuse him, so we went into the big house to see what we could find. And we found this. We’ve been busy cleaning it all day. Now I have something to amuse [MASK] with.” “And amuse yourself.
<name>Ade</name>	Ade	Nnaife	So [MASK] and his family moved to a mud house in the Onike area, an area where there was no running tap water and no electricity, to which flocked young Ibos who would rather save money than pay the new exorbitant rents some landlords were asking.
<name>Baby</name>	Baby	Baby	But she knew she could not wait for ever; the child was now six weeks old and everybody simply called him “[MASK]”. She washed him, and with the money she had saved from the rent went out in search of a place to buy cigarette cartons on the black market.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Agbadi	“You can’t go now. You have to finish what you started,” [MASK] observed. She whirled round. “Who is going to stop me? Who dares to stop me? You?” she wailed, very near hysteria. “Bah!
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nnaife	[MASK] was growing old fast and, like an old man, he had become too sensitive even to bother to offer his wives any explanation of his now frequently explosive behaviour. His skin had acquired a kind of ashy dryness due to exposure in the foundry workshop where he now worked as a supervisor.
<name>Adunni</name>	Adunni	Kehinde	We have to uphold the Law now, young woman. And did the Yoruba family abduct you?” “No, no,” [MASK] answered slowly. “I ran to them. And I am going to marry Aremu the butcher’s son.”
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Agbadi	One of these mistresses was a very beautiful young woman who managed to combine stubbornness with arrogance. So stubborn was she that she refused to live with [MASK]. Men being what they are, he preferred spending his free time with her, with this woman who enjoyed humiliating him by refusing to be his wife.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Cordelia	“Eh, but he left you only about an hour ago.” "I know, he has taken some of my housekeeping money,” [MASK] lied, forcing herself to make a sound that was meant to be laughter, but which sounded croaky even to her own ears.
<name>Ezinma</name>	Ezinma	Nnaife	And if you are ever in a bad patch with the boys’ education, don’t forget that girls grow very quickly; the twins’ bride prices will help out. But [MASK] would be back by then. Go, and save your sons’ inheritance.”
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Nwakusor	The man was gasping breathlessly. He had swerved so dramatically that some of the passengers hanging outside the bus had to jump down to save themselves from injury. There were screams and the squeaking of brakes. [MASK] realised that he had had a narrow escape from death.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Iyawo	He crawled from the mat on which he was lying, and at his efforts to reach the bowl of porridge his mother wept — he was like a moving carcass. But he refused her help, and reached the wooden tray just as [MASK] brought in the spoons.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Nwakusor	“We have no choice,” the landlord concluded. In the evening, they were even more dismayed to learn from [MASK] that newly-recruited soldiers were usually taken out of the country within twenty-four hours.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Agbadi	[MASK] was no different from many men. He himself might take wives and then neglect them for years, apart from seeing that they each received their one yam a day; he could bring his mistress to sleep with him right in his courtyard while his wives pined and bit their nails for a word from him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Nnaife	"So it’s all my fault, is it?” [MASK] laughed and said, “You answer your father back, eh, son? Well, maybe if your mother was not so keen on getting money, maybe you would have won a scholarship.
<name>Thyestes</name>	Thyestes	Agbadi	he shouted. “Stop that at once!” [MASK] roared, limping up to his son. “What do you call this, bravery? You make my stomach turn.” The slave woman turned her eyes, now glazed with approaching death, towards him.
<name>Nkem</name>	Nkem	Oshia	He gave her a little housekeeping money which bought a bag of garri for the month and some yams; she would have to make up the rest from her trading profits. On top of that, he paid the school fees for [MASK], who was growing fast and was his mother’s pride and joy.
<name>Adolph</name>	Adolph	Agbadi	“Good; but remember that you are not married to [MASK]. I don’t want his money. You must come home as soon as he is better.” “Why do you not turn her into a man?”
<name>Chika</name>	Chika	Adim	There was a suppressed ripple of laughter in the court. “But your husband told us he pays the school fees, how is that?” “Yes, he pays the school fees.” “Do you mean the two of you pay [MASK]’s school fees?”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Nnaife	Did the woman think that [MASK] might be dead? Had she received news of it from somebody? She told herself not to be foolish. Catastrophic news would not be imparted to her in this way; it would be done in a more theatrical way.
<name>Leah</name>	Leah	Amatokwu	You who put [MASK]’s manhood in question so that he had to marry again quickly and have many children in quick succession. Now you come here, where I did not particularly press you to be pregnant in the first month, and you talk this foolishness.”
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Taiwo	They are predicting that none of you will come to any good. Are you going to fulfil their hopes by rejecting yourself too? You can blame me if you like, but listen, good son; so far you and your sister [MASK] are my only hope.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Nnaife	I am not even well enough to dry them out. I am ill with a child, [MASK]. So you have to think fast. You always need something to push you into action — well, here it is: another child is on the way.”
<name>Yashim</name>	Yashim	Ubani	“They stopped being men long ago. Now they are machines. But I love [MASK]. I was married into his family when I was only five. His mother brought me up, and I had grown to like and respect him long before he sent for me.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Nnaife	[MASK]’s heart was singing. He quickly disappeared and could even afford to go home by bus. On reaching the Loco Market, he bought a small bag of rice, a large tin of herrings and some fruit, costing him less than a shilling altogether.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Ona	He worked on her, breaking down all her resistance. He stroked and explored with his perfect hand, banking heavily on the fact that [MASK] was a woman, a mature woman, who had had him many a time. And he was right.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Amatokwu	I’ve given you a home and, if all goes well, the child you and your father have been wanting, and you still sit there staring at me with hatred in your eyes. The day you mention [MASK]’s name in this house again I shall give you the greatest beating you have ever had.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Nnaife	Her grey eyes were sunken, and [MASK] was always uneasy when she talked to him, for not only must he watch her lips to catch what she was saying, he had to watch those eyes right inside her head. It was like watching the eyes of a cat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nnamdio	“Wait until you are asked to speak. I am talking to this fool on whose stupid head I spent all the money I sweated for in the army.” [MASK]’s contribution was: “I don’t want to go to a silly school.
