<name>me</name>	me	Giles	They were in her handwriting, so they couldn't be forgeries." "Of course they were forgeries! But that is where he overreached himself. He was so anxious, you see, to stop you and [MASK] making investigations.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Gwenda	Anywhere on the dividing wall would have done equally well, but she had always gone au- tomatically, thinking of other things, to the one place where a door had actually been: "I hope," thought [MASK] uneasily, "that I'm not clairvoyant or anything...."
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Gwennie	That is why I was attracted by your advertisement and hoped that I should get news of her." He added gently: "I'm very sorry about this, [MASK]. But you had to know. I only wish you could have left well alone...."
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Giles	"You know, there's a great deal of—well, queerness about— more than people imagine. I have seen some of it...." Her face was thoughtful. "There can't be, you see, any normal explanation," said [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Halliday	You're suggesting that he'd be willing to put himself in jeopardy as an accessory after the fact. I don't believe he would. He'd do his best for [MASK] by giving evidence as to his mental state—that, yes.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Gwenda	"You've had a shock, you know. We'll talk about it in the morning. Don't worry about anything. Just go to sleep." She drew the covers up, smiled, patted [MASK] and went out.
<name>he</name>	he	Gwenda	She was civil enough"—he paused—"but she didn't ask me to stay to dinner. No, I didn't meet your father." Had there, [MASK] wondered, been a trace of rancor in that "She didn't ask me to stay to dinner"?
<name>She</name>	She	Gwenda	I'll get her to write to you. In the meanwhile, eleven o'clock on Thursday?" [MASK] went out of the office and down the stairs. There was a cobweb in the angle of the stairway. In the middle of the web was a pale, rather nondescript spider.
<name>Mrs. Bixby</name>	Mrs. Bixby	Gwenda	"Is it your poor child, my dear?" [MASK] looked slightly taken aback. She said doubtfully: "No—no. It isn't." "Ah, I wondered." The old lady nodded her head and sipped her milk.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	Tell me, did [MASK] say anything to you about my father? That she was worried about him? Or—or afraid of him? Anything like that?" "Afraid of him? Why? Oh, I see, you thought he might have been jealous.
<name>Wyncot</name>	Wyncot	Storkleg	"I think that will be very nice indeed. And I always find [MASK] so reliable. It really doesn't shrink. I think I'll take an extra two ounces." The assistant remarked that the wind was very cold today, as she wrapped up the parcel.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	"No. I was thinking of [MASK] dead. I don't like to think of her dead." "You're right there. I don't like to think of it myself. Stunning looks she had."
<name>Gregory</name>	Gregory	Gwenda	We know that there was a body." He paused and went on. "From his point of view, everything fits in. Missing clothes and suitcase, the farewell note. And later, two letters from his sister." [MASK] stirred. "Those letters.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Walter	"[MASK] always says he really cannot be bothered with the modern young woman. They don't appeal to him. He and I have so much in common that I'm afraid he doesn't go out as much as he should.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	This might cut both ways. Supposing [MASK] was in love with him—the first man she ever was in love with, and supposing she went on being in love with him. Perhaps they had an affair together and she didn't let anyone know about it.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Kennedy	Some confidential matter relating to one of their clients." "Was he—sore about his dismissal?" [MASK] gave him a sharp glance and said briefly: "Yes." "And there wasn't any other reason at all for your disliking his friendship with your sister?
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Gwenda	I didn't know what to think. I got out the car again, and we drove along here. The house was quiet and dark. We went up to the bedroom—" [MASK] broke in: "The bedroom?" Her voice held pure astonishment.
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Lilacs	Still they was growing a treat—never seen a healthier lot of forsythia. [MASK] isn't much, but them wiglers costs money—and mind you—they're too old to replant." "Oh, I know. But this is much, much nicer."
<name>Miss Blacklock</name>	Miss Blacklock	Giles	Just advising you (because I've lived a long time and know how very upsetting human nature can be) to let well alone. That's my advice, let well alone." "But it isn't letting well alone." [MASK]'s voice held a different note, a sterner note.
<name>Blore</name>	Blore	Afflick	"What about her brother, the doctor chap, doesn't he know where she is?" "No." "I see. Regular mystery, isn't it? Why not advertise?" "We have." [MASK] said casually: "Looks as though she's dead.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gwenda	"God bless my soul. Grown-up and married. How time flies! It must be—what—fifteen years—no, of course, much longer than that. You don't remember me, I suppose?" [MASK] shook her head.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gwenda	The bath with the mahogany surround. You told me that you thought of sailing ducks in it as soon as you saw it." [MASK] said thoughtfully: "It's true that I seemed to know right away just where everything was—the kitchen and the linen cupboard.
<name>him</name>	him	Gwenda	He was polite but obviously irritated by colonial insistence on sentimental family ties. "And you think my sister—my half-sister—and possibly myself—are connections of yours?" he asked [MASK] civilly, but with slight hostility. "
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gwenda	It's rather loose, but I couldn't bear to lose it because it's my engagement ring." The hunt was soon under way. [MASK] retraced her steps of yesterday, tried to recollect where she had stood and what flowers she had touched.
<name>She</name>	She	Gwenda	Immediately [MASK] felt a throb of appreciation— almost of recognition. This was her house! Already she was sure of it. She could picture the garden, the long windows—she was sure that the house was just what she wanted.
<name>she</name>	she	Gwenda	He talked of ordinary things in an ordinary manner, but there was something—that something that women are quick to recognize and to which they react in a purely female way. Almost unconsciously [MASK] adjusted her skirt, tweaked at a side curl, retouched her lips.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	Yes—that's it. [MASK] and my father felt they were alike—and there was me to be looked after, and she thought she could make him happy—and she even thought, perhaps, that she'd be quite happy herself in the end."
<name>Heidi</name>	Heidi	Leonie	but she didn't know who to. If we could get hold of her, we might learn a lot more." "And from [MASK], the Swiss girl." "Perhaps—but she was a foreigner and wouldn't catch on to much of what went on.
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Walter	But [MASK], poor boy, fell very much in love with her. As I say, quite unsuitable, no money and no prospects, and not the kind of girl one wanted as a daughter-in-law. Still, what can a mother do?
<name>he</name>	he	Giles	After all, when [MASK] came home, they would go together to the musical shows and all that. She flinched slightly at the prospect of They Walked Without Feet, but supposed she might enjoy it—only the point about "significant" plays was that you usually didn't.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Lily	Or of someone? My stepmother, I mean." "I do remember—now that you say that—" "Yes?" "[MASK] came into the kitchen one day. She'd been dusting the stairs, and she said, 'Ructions!'
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Gwenda	Why not rely on the story that she'd 'left him'?" [MASK] pushed back her hair from her forehead. She was less stiff and rigid now, and the patches of sharp color were fading. "I don't know," she admitted.
<name>Uncle Vernon</name>	Uncle Vernon	Afflick	"Don't look martyred. I'll get it." She ran back into the house. Through the open door of the study she heard [MASK] say loudly: "What do you want to come butting in for? Never any sense."
<name>He</name>	He	Giles	"You came to see her more than once, didn't you?" He hesitated a moment. "Twice—perhaps three times. Just dropped in." He nodded with sudden finality. "Sorry I can't help you." [MASK] got up.
<name>Mr. Nuttel</name>	Mr. Nuttel	Raymond	All her dressing tables have their legs swathed in chintz. She lives in a village, the kind of village where nothing ever happens, exactly like a stagnant pond." "Something did happen there once," his wife said drily. [MASK] waved his hand.
<name>George</name>	George	Helen	But now that you have mentioned it, I do remember thinking that [MASK] was worried... "Worried?" "Yes. I thought perhaps it was because of my wife—" He broke off. "But it was more than that."
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Gwenda	That fits in very well with her being so mysterious about who the man in question is." "But if she was going to leave her husband for him, why did he kill her?" asked [MASK]. "Perhaps because she suddenly changed her mind.
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Giles	Because after this lapse of time there is nothing that you can do—nothing, I mean, of a constructive nature." "You mean that after this lapse of time, there is nothing we can find out?" asked [MASK].
<name>Minnie</name>	Minnie	Gwenda	[MASK] fitted them on over her hands and began to wash up the dishes. She might as well keep her hands nice. She washed the plates and put them in the rack, washed and dried the other things, and put everything neatly away.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Manning	[MASK] was a bent, crabbed-looking old man with a rheumy and slightly cunning eye. The pace at which he was raking a path accelerated noticeably as his employers drew near. "Morning, sir. Morning, m'am.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Giles	"My goodness—not that chap?" "Yes." "But he was a miserable little rat. So he's come up in the world?" "Will you tell me something, sir," said [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kennedy	and they followed him. A trail of sr retreating slowly along the valley. "There goes the train," said [MASK]. "Coming into the station?" "No, leaving it." He paused. "She'll be here any minute now."
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Foster	"Old times? How?" [MASK] tapped with his spade. "I come on the old steps—see, that's where they went—just as you want 'em now. Then someone planted them over and covered them up."
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Helen	I didn't know why. I was always a strait-laced sort of fellow—a believer in marital fidelity. [MASK] wouldn't have wanted me to know what was going on. I'd heard rumors—one does—but there was no mention of any particular name.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Gwenda	Supposing he threatened that if she married anyone else, he would kill her." "Most improbable," said [MASK]. "Things like that do happen. Remember what you overheard his wife say to him. You put it all down to jealousy, but it may have been true.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Gwenda	[MASK] looked slightly dubious—she said slowly: "I suppose that might be it...." "I wish you could remember a bit more.... Come down here in the hall. Shut your eyes. Think... Doesn't anything more come back to you?"
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Gwenda	Yes, very pretty." "Who were her people?" "No idea at all. No idea. You don't look like her." [MASK] nearly said: "She was only my stepmother," but refrained from complicating the issue.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Giles	"You couldn't actually see the man who said the words?" "I can't remember seeing him. He must have been just a bit farther back—yes, there. I could only see his paws." “Paws." [MASK] frowned.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Gwenda	A very likeable young man, tall and fair, with a disarming way of blinking every now and then out of a natural shyness. She noted his determined chin and the set of his jaw. "We'll have tea in the little writing room, the dark one," said [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Walter	And he hadn't been out there a year (doing very well, too; [MASK] does everything well) than would you believe it, this impudent chit of a girl changes her mind and writes out that she'd like to marry him after all."
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Dorothy	She held the floor and was enjoying the opportunity to reminisce to this sympathetic friend of dear [MASK]'s. "A most unsuitable girl—as seems always to be the way. Oh. I don't mean an actress or anything like that.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	Suppose it wasn't quite like that. Suppose he fell desperately in love with [MASK], and that it was she who wouldn't run off with him. Supposing he threatened that if she married anyone else, he would kill her."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Gwenda	First that net—and then her bad foot." "A bad foot?" asked [MASK]. "Yes—fell over a scraper or somesuch and cut it. Not much more than a graze, it seemed, but it wouldn't heal.
<name>He</name>	He	Gwenda	"And I did live there, didn't I?" [MASK] said. "Yes, of course you did." He stared at her, amused. "Why did you want to come back there? You can't remember much about it, surely?"
<name>Marple</name>	Marple	Marple	There was no body, a suitcase and clothes were taken—what else could I think?" "And your sister had been—recently—rather— ahem"—Miss [MASK] coughed delicately—"interested in—in a certain gentleman?"
<name>He</name>	He	Gwenda	"A very simple will. When would you like to come in and sign it?" [MASK] said whenever he liked. There was no particular hurry. "We've got a house down here, you know," she said.
<name>the police</name>	the police	Kennedy	So go on from there and explain, if you can, what happened to the body." "Perhaps my father buried it somewhere—in the garden?" "And then went to [MASK] and told him he'd mur- dered his wife? Why?
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Helen	"Oh, I see. How stupid of me. I've got it all wrong. It was [MASK]—my stepmother. Of course it's all long before I remember. I was only a child when my father's second marriage broke up.
<name>Werewolf</name>	Werewolf	Gwenda	"They were paws. Gray paws—not human." "But look here, [MASK]. This isn't a kind of Murder in the Rue Morgue. A man doesn't have paws." "Well, he had paws."
<name>John</name>	John	Giles	I hear that he is considered locally as rather a scrimshanker—more talk than work." "Talk and tea is his specialty," said [MASK]. "He has about five cups of tea a day. But he works splendidly when we are looking."
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Giles	[MASK] looked like a different kind of little boy—a little boy who has had his nice new toy taken away from him. "1 suppose it might have been a nightmare," he admitted grudgingly. Then his face cleared suddenly. "No," he said.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Giles	"Well—surely—that is very nice, isn't it?" "Is it? When I'm not sure if I'm mad or not? If I'm mad, I ought never to have married [MASK]. And the house and everything.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Gwenda	Just a boy and girl affair. Neither of us took it seriously." He added drily, "We weren't encouraged to do SO." "You must think us dreadfully impertinent," began [MASK], but he interrupted her. "What's the odds?
<name>she</name>	she	Gwenda	Perhaps that was what really worried her. Because, strictly speaking, it would be much more satisfactory if you could only make out a good case against one of them. One ought to be sure, by now, which. And [MASK] wasn't sure.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Haydock	"Murder in retrospect, in fact?" "Just exactly that." [MASK] reflected for a moment. "There had been no miscarriage of justice? Nobody had suffered as a result of this crime?" "As far as one can see, no."
<name>women</name>	women	Helen	I should think he was frightfully upright and all that, and devoted to his mother, and with a lot of virtues. But from a woman's point of view, terribly dull. I can see why he didn't cut any ice with [MASK].
<name>Mr. Satterthwaite</name>	Mr. Satterthwaite	Giles	[MASK] had spoken up then. He had said: "I think, perhaps, we could help you with a suggestion or two." And he told the inspector about the shifting of the steps leading down to the lawn, and took the inspector out onto the terrace.
<name>she</name>	she	Lily	And when she run on about it, I didn't listen because, mark you, she was working it all up out of nothing. Liked a bit of crime, [MASK] did. Used to take the Sunday News what was running a series about Famous Murderers.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Giles	But you must remember that the doctor's car was actually standing outside the hospital that night—he probably leaped to the conclusion that she meant his car. The adjective posh was meaningless to him." "I see," said [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Giles	One of those two, and the police, who were cleverer and had more resources than she and [MASK] had, would find out which. And in the meantime both of those men would be watched. They wouldn't be able to—to try again.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Gwenda	"She didn't help us with any ideas of how to set about it," said [MASK]. "And yet I feel, from the glint in her eye, that she had a few. I wonder how she would have gone about it."
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Giles	You've been very wise to say nothing of that until now. Very wise. But I think the time has come." [MASK] said slowly: "She was strangled in the hall, and then the murderer carried her upstairs and put her on the bed.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Gwennie	"Good for you, [MASK]," he said gently. "I hope you're right. Now this is what I think we'd better do. I'll answer her letter and tell her to come here on Thursday. The train connection is quite good.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gwenda	"Really, [MASK], you might be six years old! You ought to have bunny shoes, with rabbits on them." She got into bed with a sense of relief and was soon asleep. The next morning she had various matters to see to in the town.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Hillside	[MASK]. You've told me, you know, that the house felt like home to you as soon as you got inside it. And that room you chose to sleep in, it was probably your nursery—" "It was a nursery.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	Some friend had mentioned it as a pretty place and quiet. She didn't know, of course, about [MASK]— Can you imagine the temptation? To see her again. To see what this man she had married was like."
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Helen	As soon as I came in, he looked up and said: " 'I’ve killed [MASK].' "For a moment I didn't know what to think. He was so cool and matter-of-fact. I said: 'You mean—you've had another dream?'
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Gwenda	He polished them with a silk handkerchief, looking down at the desk. "Oh yes," he said. "On the Leahampton road?" He looked up and [MASK] thought how different people who habitually wear glasses look without them.
<name>she</name>	she	Helen	He walked restlessly up and down the room. His face was lined and haggard. "I don't understand," he said. "I don't understand in the least what it all means. If [MASK] never left that house, if her letters to me were forgeries.
<name>her</name>	her	Janet	If it had been only [MASK]—but there were the boys. It was all hopeless. We agreed to say good-bye and try and forget." He laughed, a short mirthless laugh. "Forget? I never forgot—not for one moment.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Helen	These dreams, he said, were always the same, and they ended in the same way—with his throttling [MASK]. I tried to get at the root of the trouble—there must, I think, have been some conflict in early childhood.
<name>He</name>	He	Gwenda	The present superintendent was a young doctor there at the time, and will probably be able to give you full details of your father's case." [MASK] said: "And you got another letter from your sister—after that again?" "Oh yes.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	That is— he was never really normal. He's told us about himself and [MASK]—but we'll agree now that that was all a pack of lies. He didn't just think she was a cute kid— he was madly, passionately in love with her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	"What a time you've been," he greeted her. "Get anything?" "Yes. I know all about it now. It7s really rather pathetic. He was terribly in love with [MASK]." She narrated the events of the morning.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Giles	" "Suppose she gets cold feet and doesn't turn up after all?" "Oh, she'll come. [MASK], if that flashy car was there that night—" "Think it was a yellow peril like this?" "Admiring my bus?"
<name>Dickon</name>	Dickon	Jane	"Heard you were back, [MASK]," she said. "Aren't my new delphiniums doing well? Have you seen these new little gentians? I've had a bit of trouble with them. but I think they're all set now.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Gwenda	But a third person, [MASK] thought, didn't make sense. For a third person, surely, would have telephoned to only one of the two men. A third person would have wanted one suspect, not two. And anyway, who could the third person be?
<name>he</name>	he	Afflick	Everyone against him. Discharged from his employment by a faked charge made up by an "enemy." Surely that did show that [MASK] wasn't normal. And what a feeling of power a man like that would get out of killing.
<name>in fairies</name>	in fairies	....	I want to believe[MASK] But I go on feeling sure—quite sure—that when I looked down, she was dead—quite dead." "But how could you possibly tell? A child of barely three." She looked at him queerly.
<name>Lawrence</name>	Lawrence	Gwenda	She may be able to tell us a good deal." "That's wonderful," said [MASK]. "I've thought of something else," she added. "I'm going to make a new will.
<name>kiss</name>	kiss	Tcill	It seems that what actually occurred was that he went into the drawing room, read the note his wife left saying she was leaving him, and that his way of eluding this fact was to prefer to [MASK]' her. Hence the hallucination."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gwenda	[MASK], her eyes on the doctor, said: "What did my father die of?" "I couldn't really tell you, my dear. As I say, he was in rather poor health for a while, and he finally went into a sanatorium—somewhere on the east coast.
<name>John</name>	John	Kelvin	Beats it quickly. And that explains everything. [MASK]'s belief that he has killed her. The disappearance of the clothes; packed and taken away earlier in the day. And the subsequent letters which are perfectly genuine. There you are—that explains everything."
<name>George</name>	George	Walter	A gentle quiet-looking person, slightly diffident and apologetic in manner—colorless. A very nondescript personality. The devoted type of young man whom women ignore and only marry because the man they love does not return their affection. [MASK], who is Always There.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Helen	But at the revelation that his victim and [MASK] were going to escape him, he became completely unhinged. From the hospital he went through into the garden of St. Catherine's and he took with him a pair of surgical gloves.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Gwenda	On the outside of it, clearly presented to their view, was a melodramatic caption— WHO WERE THE MEN IN HER LIFE? Slowly, [MASK] nodded her head. She looked down again at the diary. There was someone—I know there was someone—
<name>She</name>	She	Helen	He says he doesn't know where she is ... that's because he knows that she's dead and that I killed her ... he's a good fellow, but I'm not deceived.... [MASK] is dead.... When did I begin to suspect her?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lily	but she'd be in any minute now, and sure enough she came in that very minute and he took her upstairs to the mistress's room. Wanted to know if she'd taken any clothes away with her and what? So [MASK] looked about and told him
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Lily	Never content with plain fact, [MASK] wasn't. Long rigmarole she told me, about the master doing in the missus and maybe putting the body in the cellar— and something about a French girl what had looked out of the window and seen something or somebody. '
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Gwenda	He was positive you were expecting him. Wouldn't take no for an answer. Waited twenty minutes. I wondered if you'd had some idea of a tea party and forgotten it." "No," said [MASK]. "How odd."
