<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Mary	“As for sheep, [MASK], well, there are plenty grazing in the mountains back home. But a soft, willing woman, now. lass, it’s a pity to admit I’m lacking one of those.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Jamie	His eyes misted with tears and his voice was strained when he whispered, “And I love you, [MASK]. You’ve been a line daughter to me. I’ve always considered you mine.” “Promise me you won’t forget me.”
<name>William</name>	William	Alec	Then I considered the fact that you’re a Scotsman, after all, and mayhap your training didn’t include . . . [MASK], why are you looking at me like that?” He couldn’t answer her. “Does my gift please you?”
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Jamie	[MASK] moved like a queen. Her back was as straight as a clean lance, she bowed her head to no man, and he decided it would have cost her mightily to affect any female weakness. She was dressed for mourning, but she still looked magnificent.
<name>her</name>	her	Angus	Don’t build me a box.” She could tell by his puzzled look that he didn’t know what she was talking about. “You were going to build [MASK] a box,” she reminded him. “Please . . .”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jamie	“It would take a war to bring me back.” “You needn’t sound so cheerful over that possibility,” [MASK] countered before she thought better of it. She let him see her frown, too, and didn’t care if she offended him.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Alec	I’m . . . worried.” He stated the obvious then. “You’re blushing like a virgin.” She gave him a disgruntled look before answering. “I can’t help that. I am a virgin.” [MASK] laughed in spite of himself.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jamie	He wasn’t as mean-looking as the other one. [MASK] came to that conclusion when he smiled at her. He had an appealing dent in the side of his cheek when he smiled, too, and his green eyes were alive with mischief.
<name>he</name>	he	Jamie	He wasn’t smiling now, but [MASK] decided not to mention that fact. “You’re happy because you’re going home?” “Because we’re going home.” His voice was back to sounding like steel again.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Alec	His eyes looked suspiciously misty to her. She realized then that she must have caused him considerable worry. “I’m going to be fine, [MASK]. I told you I wouldn’t leave you.” He couldn’t believe she was trying to comfort him.
<name>Sirius</name>	Sirius	Alec	The soldier grinned as he walked toward the entrance. His intent was to stand guard in front of the double doors. “Have a fair rest, [MASK],” he called out, the laughter in his voice quite obvious.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Jamie	It was only a little chore, she realized, but it was still a beginning. He would come to depend on her eventually, when he saw how much nicer his home was going to be. [MASK] straightened her shoulders and started up the hill.
<name>Thorin</name>	Thorin	Jamie	The burr in the soldier’s voice was so thick [MASK] couldn’t catch every word. She heard enough, though, to blush in reaction. The two giants were taking turns insulting each other. It was yet another odd habit, she supposed.
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Jamie	He would take her, of course, but he didn’t want her cringing away from him or waiting in dread. He decided to use a little diplomacy. “Until you wear my plaid, [MASK]. We’ll wait until then.”
<name>oak</name>	oak	Gavin	“I need more light, linen strips, a goblet of warm water, bowls with more water, and two slats of wood, [MASK], about this size and length,” she instructed, showing him with her hands the desired dimensions.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jamie	I don’t want to know what they wear underneath.” “Oh, but 1 want to tell you.” He was smiling just like a rascal. [MASK] had to sigh over his ungentlemanly remarks and her own unladylike reaction.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Alec	“Why does my honesty make you laugh?” “ ’Twas the way you gave it.” “I don’t want to continue this discussion, [MASK]. If you’ve finished your meal, I’ll put the food away.”
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Alec	“I’m insignificant and foolish? [MASK], you must find me most inferior,” she countered. “Yet you’re ready for sainthood, aren’t you? Why, you never lose your temper or get angry. Isn’t that what you told me?”
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Jamie	“Well, of course you wouldn’t come after me. I’m too insignificant to bother with?” “No, I wouldn’t come after you.” [MASK] had to lower her gaze to the ground lest he turn around and see how much his words had hurt her.
<name>Murtagh</name>	Murtagh	Jamie	“How do they keep their britches rolled up above the hem of their plaids?” she asked. “They don't.” “Then what . . .” From the devilish look in his eyes, [MASK] decided she didn’t want to know.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Jamie	“Here’s the goblet of water you wanted. The bowls are behind you.” [MASK] opened one of the medicine jars, pinched a sprinkle of brown powder between her thumb and forefinger, and mixed it with the water in the goblet.
<name>John</name>	John	Gavin	“None of us want her to worry. We're all bent on making her happy, now. aren’t we?” [MASK] grinned. “Aye, we are.” They shared a laugh, but the sound was drowned out by all the noise the women were making.
<name>He</name>	He	Alec	The man was as stubborn as she was. “Have we crossed the border yet?” [MASK] shook his head. “We’ve only a stone’s throw to go.” “Then why were you smiling?” “In anticipation.” “Oh.”
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Jamie	He tells me often enough.” She had the audacity to look disgruntled with him. “I’m your husband and your laird, wife. Are those two reasons sufficient for you?” The muscle in his jaw flexed again. [MASK] was fascinated by it.
<name>Brianna</name>	Brianna	Jamie	You look like an angel, but you sound . . . English.” He’d roared the last of his statement and immediately started struggling. [MASK] leaned so close to his right ear she was almost kissing him, then whispered in Gaelic, “Rest easy, friend.
<name>Lisbeth</name>	Lisbeth	Jamie	“You can’t mean it.” “I told you to shut your mouth,” the enemy ordered again. He gave her hair another vicious yank to emphasize his command. [MASK] slammed her foot down on top of his in retaliation.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Jamie	“It’s yours to keep, [MASK].” “A wedding present?” She wouldn’t look at him. Though her head was bent, he could still see how red her cheeks were. Her embarrassment was terribly obvious. And vastly amusing.
<name>Ross</name>	Ross	Alec	She actually seemed surprised. [MASK] let her see his exasperation. “You wore a black gown to your wedding,” he reminded her. “I happen to like this gown,” she returned, pausing to brush a bit of dust off the hem.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Jamie	His skin warmed her shivers away, too. “It’s better now?” His voice was whisper-soft against her ear. [MASK] nodded, yet still didn’t pull away from him. His other hand was resting on her silky thigh.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Alec	“’Tis good of you to notice.” [MASK] left the hall before she could stifle her laughter enough to bait him again. His soldiers would be waiting in the courtyard and the bailey below, wishing to hear how their friend was doing.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Beak	“You’re forever reminding me,” he added. “I should have realized you were skilled,” he admitted then. “[MASK] told me you were the only one who could seat the mare. Still, he added that you didn’t ride often.”
<name>Fezzik</name>	Fezzik	Jamie	The shorter of the two giants made that statement. [MASK] had been staring at the space between the two warriors and immediately turned to look at the one who’d just spoken. He wasn’t as mean-looking as the other one.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Alec	[MASK] closed his eyes in reaction. She was too tired and obviously too sore to be attacked by her husband. He would have to wait, he told himself. It was the only decent thing to do. It was going to be his most difficult challenge.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jamie	“I told him you were timid.” “You didn’t!” “Said you were weak, used to be being coddled.” “No.” “And that you liked to spend your days sewing and churchgoing.” [MASK] started to laugh.
<name>John</name>	John	Gavin	“Did you see . . . Was there a chair among the items in the wagon?” “There wasn’t a wagon’s worth,” [MASK] explained. “It isn’t possible for a wagon to make the narrow climb.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Alec	He claimed her for his own, though. I’ll give him that much kindness. Did you get a good look at her, then?” he added in a rush. [MASK] nodded. “You’ll be taking her with you, won’t you?”
<name>Jon Snow</name>	Jon Snow	Beak	[MASK] asked, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice. "Aye,” the lord answered. “With no one seeing to your backsides?” “We don’t need anyone else seeing to our protection,” the lord answered.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Cholie	“Well, if you’d bothered to mention that fact, I wouldn’t have believed any of your tales. You know as well as I do that the kitchen help tips the jug of ale all day long. [MASK] was probably sotted.”
<name>He</name>	He	Jamie	He hadn’t shouted, but his cold tone of voice sent shivers down her spine. [MASK] started wringing the rest of the pleats out of her plaid. A few minutes later, she found herself in the most ludicrous position.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Alec	You’ve still to say it, [MASK].” “It’s a man’s name.” “Are we back to that?” “Aye, we are.” She refused to look at him until he finished laughing, then said, “My name certainly seems to give you vast amusement.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Alec	“I don’t care,” he told her over his shoulder. She frowned at [MASK]’s back, irritated because he hadn’t even bothered to say good-bye, then wondered what he was up to when he reached up and claimed his sword from the wall.
<name>him</name>	him	Alec	I have his promise. Please don’t worry. I’ll go inside and explain it all to [MASK]. I’m certainly not afraid.” “ ’Tis your lack of fear that has me most afeared,” the old man admitted.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Alec	“Yes, she will wonder,” he agreed. “Then let the woman wonder,” [MASK] snapped. “Just tell 266 her it is by my order. The woman shouldn’t be doing common chores, damn it all,” he added.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alec	The woman hasn’t quit complaining since we reached my home. Do you know, she actually took exception to the fact I have a mistress?” [MASK] smiled. “They’re funny that way,” he said.
<name>Catelyn</name>	Catelyn	Jamie	And if it’s a girl . . .” “Yes?” “I shall name her after you, milady.” [MASK] would have laughed if she’d had the strength. She was so exhausted, though, she could only manage a smile.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Angus	Let the potion woo you to sleep.” The soft burr she’d deliberately put in her voice sounded awful to her. [MASK] was too drowsy to notice, though. He quit his struggles and closed his eyes again. He fell asleep with a smile on his face.
<name>she</name>	she	Mary	You may see her as often as you like.” His explanation didn’t make sense to her. “We go for three days in the opposite direction, you tell me, yet [MASK] will end up only an hour’s ride away when we finally reach your home?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jamie	[MASK] decided it would be best for her to leave before her husband turned his attention to her. She certainly wasn't running away, she told herself. No, she just needed a little time to sort this confusing matter out.
<name>the husband</name>	the husband	Alec	“You shouted your love in front of everyone, wife. Don’t deny it now,” [MASK] demanded. “You’ll put that boy down first,” she countered. “You’ll answer me first.” “Yes, I love you.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Jamie	She jumped off the ridge above the pasture.” “It couldn’t have been an accident? She didn’t fall?” “No, it wasn’t an accident. She was seen.” [MASK] shook her head. “I don’t understand.
<name>He</name>	He	Jamie	He needs me. He still needs to tell me he loves me, she thought. And just where in bloody hell was he? [MASK] was suddenly furious. After he saved her, she was going to give him a good lecture on the merits of being prompt.
<name>Arin</name>	Arin	Alec	When their mounts were side by side, he still didn’t let go of the reins. His face was impassive now and he stared straight ahead. “Is there danger, [MASK]?” She hadn’t been able to keep her worry out of her voice.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Alec	He became rougher in his quest. “We aren’t going to stop, are we, [MASK]?” “Nay, love, we aren’t.” He withdrew his fingers, then thrust them demandingly into her tight sheath again. She cried out in pain.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Mary	How dare he criticize her in front of their guests? “[MASK] asked me if she could stay here, and I gave her permission,” she said. “If you want to call it sanctuary, then by all means do so.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Beak	My, you are nervous today. You keep looking over your shoulder. Do you think someone’s going to pounce on you from behind? What in—” “I missed me nap,” [MASK] blurted out. “That’s why I’m surly.”
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Jamie	“If you take another step back, you’ll end up on top of the heap.” [MASK] took one look over her shoulder, saw the stack of bodies, and felt her knees give out on her. She would have fallen on her face if he hadn’t held her up.
<name>Lyanna</name>	Lyanna	Jamie	Her presence was as commanding as her beauty, too. [MASK] had been endowed with her mama’s handsome looks. She had long raven-colored hair, violet eyes that reminded her papa of springtime, and skin as flawless and pure as her heart.
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Jamie	“He isn’t dying?” The priest asked that question. The old man struggled to his feet, wheezing from the effort. He stared at [MASK] with a frown as fierce as any she’d ever seen.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Alec	His tone didn’t leave room for her to argue. “But where?” she persisted. “Do we sleep behind the screen, [MASK], or in one of the rooms above the stairs?” She turned to motion to the balcony and suddenly froze.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Jamie	“Do you always have such trouble waking after a nap?” he asked. “I don’t know,” [MASK] answered. “I’ve never taken a nap before.” She missed his frown when she turned to look around.
<name>Brom</name>	Brom	Daniel	It was a pitiful effort, though. Oh, how he wished the other warrior were the more powerful of the two. At least the one called [MASK] smiled on occasion. “Are you strong enough to protect what belongs to you?”
<name>The soldier</name>	The soldier	Marcus	Her whisper was so soft that only he could hear what she was saying. [MASK]’s expression didn’t change, but when she was finished, he gave her a quick nod. She thanked the soldier, then turned to confront his sister.
<name>He</name>	He	Alec	Neither one of them was capable of speaking again. [MASK] did withdraw from her, then thrust deep inside once more. She raised her hips to meet him halfway. She wanted all of him to squeeze tight. Passion, like wildfire, raged between them.
<name>Jaime</name>	Jaime	Kincaid	"Aye,” the lord answered. “With no one seeing to your backsides?” “We don’t need anyone else seeing to our protection,” the lord answered. “That’s an English inclination, not ours. Isn’t that right, [MASK]?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Marcus	“It was a deliberate insult. 1 did it on purpose. I restrained myself though. I wanted to give that horrible woman a few good bruises to remember me by.” “1 spit on it.” [MASK] had made that announcement.
<name>Mr. Bates</name>	Mr. Bates	Alec	“Now, while we’re on the topic of your dear little wife, I was wondering if you’d give her permission to use one of the empty rooms above the stairs. She asked me to put the question to you, [MASK].”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Beak	“I can’t explain it,” she whispered. “I just think he wouldn’t. . .” She let out a sigh, then added, “You’ll think me daft, [MASK], but his eyes . . .
<name>the bouquet</name>	the bouquet	Justin	There, are you happy?” He tossed [MASK] to the ground with a quick flick of his wrist. His casual strength didn’t upset her, she realized. The opposite was really the truth. She not only liked his strength, she depended upon it.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Alec	“Have me now, [MASK],” she whispered. “Don’t make me wait any longer. I want...” Her moan of pleasure when his fingers stretched inside her ended her plea. She arched against him even as she tried to pull his hand away.
<name>her</name>	her	Jamie	The woman didn’t make a sound, though, a fact that made [MASK] admire her all the more. Under similar circumstances, she’d probably be wailing uncontrollably. She peeked around her husband to get a better look at the man they were mourning.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Jamie	“I will try in future to remember this dictate,” he promised. “[MASK], there will be times when I will forget again.” “I’ll have to get used to it, I suppose,” she said. “Your shout could fell a pine tree.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Alice	“These Highlands can’t be very far away.” “I’ll pack your beautiful tapestries,” [MASK] interjected. “I promise I won’t forget anything. In no time at all you’ll be feeling right at home.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Alec	He nodded again. “Identical.” She was horrified. A crowd had gathered, too, making her humiliation all the more stinging. “Well, spit,” she muttered, low enough for only [MASK] to hear. “Why didn’t you tell me?
<name>He</name>	He	Alec	Her breasts were flattened against his chest, her nipples hardened by the erotic touch of his crisp hair and hot skin against her sensitive skin. “I want you to stop now,” she moaned. [MASK] didn’t pay any attention to her weak protest.
<name>Desdemona</name>	Desdemona	Jamie	“Why didn’t you tell me? I’ve injured the wrong man.” [MASK] immediately dropped her weapon and tried to help her victim to his feet so she wouldn’t have to look at her husband’s dark expression any longer.
<name>she</name>	she	Jamie	The soldier’s eyes widened over that confession. “I’m certain your wife would have done the very same thing,” [MASK] continued. “No lady wishes to be pawed by any man but her husband.” “I’m not married,” he countered.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Alec	[MASK] gave her other breast the same blissful attention, then trailed hot kisses down her stomach. He made her forget to breathe. He knelt down in front of her, cupped her smooth buttocks with his hands, and roughly pulled her up against his open mouth.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Gavin	The lass had even folded the garment on the floor and tried to stretch herself out atop it. Aye, she’d tried ways I’d never heard of until she confessed them to me.” “And so you assisted her,” [MASK] interjected with a nod.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Jamie	“Well, you should have,” [MASK] muttered. “In future, I would ask you do keep count. It’s the least you could do.” “Why?” “Because I only have eight shillings left, that’s why.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Alec	She quickly did as he had ordered. [MASK] was sure her blush could start a fire. “How long do you think it’s going to take you to get used to seeing me dressed this way?” he asked, his exasperation obvious. She recovered quickly.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Alec	“I slowed the pace because of your condition,” [MASK] explained. “What condition?” “You were tender, or have you forgotten that fact?” She immediately blushed, telling him she hadn’t forgotten at all. “And you’re clearly exhausted.”
<name>He</name>	He	Alec	He was puzzled by her comment, too, for she’d inadvertently failed to include herself. Or had it been inadvertent? [MASK] beckoned her forward with a crook of his finger. When she stood directly in front of him and no one could overhear their conversation, he asked her to explain.
<name>David</name>	David	Lindsay	He shook his head. “You’ll tell.” “No, I won’t tell. What are you doing here, then?” The child lifted his shoulders in a shrug. “I like to go hunting. My name’s [MASK].”
<name>she</name>	she	Jamie	He couldn’t understand why [MASK] was so concerned. She didn’t even know the man. Still, her sympathy pleased him. “He isn’t late,” he announced. “Tardiness would be an insult to me, wife. No, something has happened to him.”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Alec	She jerked her hands away. “Look at me.” He waited until she obeyed his command before speaking again. “You’ve shown me how courageous you are, wife. I’m very pleased with you.” Her eyes widened in surprise. [MASK] smiled.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Alec	The cramp caught her off guard. She’d nearly gained the shore when the arch in her right foot twisted into an excruciating knot. The pain doubled her over. She grabbed hold of her foot while underwater, then shot up for a gulp of air. “[MASK]!”
<name>Stefan</name>	Stefan	Beak	She brushed the wetness away, straightened her shoulders, and then nudged Wildfire into motion. [MASK] stood in the center of the courtyard, watching his mistress leave. He prayed she wouldn’t turn around. He didn’t want her to see him in such an undisciplined state.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Jamie	He guessed she didn’t want him killing anyone. That was such an amusing thought that he couldn’t help but smile. Hell, he’d probably killed twice that number. The fight had been fierce. He wasn’t about to share that information with [MASK], though.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Jamie	He’ll calm down in an hour or two. Then you can—” “Have more faith in your laird,” [MASK] countered. “He’ll see the rightness in the change, once it’s finished.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Alec	“[MASK], I’ll close my ears to your conversation just as soon as you give me your answer. Surely you can see the wisdom in my request. We could be moved upstairs before—” “We?” “What?
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Gavin	From where they stood, [MASK] could keep his eye on the door above the stairs. No one could go in or out without him noticing. “I want two soldiers below the window.” “What window?”
<name>she</name>	she	Helena	I don’t think she killed herself. I’m sure it was an accident.” “You have a tender heart, lass, and if it makes you feel better to believe that’s how [MASK] died, then I’ll agree with you.”
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Jamie	“And when I find him . . .” [MASK]’s voice reached the men then. She was singing to herself while she had her bath, a rather bawdy English ballad it was. which drew smiles and raised eyebrows from her appreciative audience.
<name>She</name>	She	Jamie	She’d just seen him kill so easily, so brutally, so casually. And now he looked as if he wanted to smile over it. [MASK] couldn’t make up her mind if she wanted to run away from him or stay and throttle him.
<name>Waterloo</name>	Waterloo	Philip	“After you hit [MASK]?” “Sir, this isn’t the time to laugh. Nay, this is a serious matter.” “I do apologize, my lady,” the soldier returned. “And then what happened?”
<name>Mairi</name>	Mairi	Jamie	“I agree with you, lass,” the priest answered. He glanced up and saw the exasperated look on his laird’s face. He had trouble restraining his chuckle. “Well, now,” [MASK] said, her sigh of relief evident.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Jamie	When she stood a foot or two away from him, the soldier straightened away from the mantel. [MASK] managed a smile. Her plaid fell to the floor when she affected a second proper curtsy. And that was simply the last upset she could take.
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Jamie	“You’ll wear my colors to keep warm, [MASK].” He couldn’t resist brushing his mouth against the top of her head. He was beginning to think his wife was the most imazing creature. She could fall asleep within the blink of an eye.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Jamie	His arrogant grin changed her mind. He didn’t realize he cared, she guessed, and he’d probably just get angry with her if she dared instruct him in his true feelings. [MASK] let out a lusty laugh. He’d have to settle in first.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jamie	“Throw the woman out.” “He’d get angry with me, [MASK],” her sister whispered. “I’ve grown to like his smiles too much to prick his temper. He’s being very kind to me, too, now that I’ve quit crying.
