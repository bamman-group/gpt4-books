<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Rene	“And you are younger than I thought to have been a soldier, for my boy there is but twelve years old and he was bom before the war.” [MASK] shifted his position, as if preparing to flee when the time came.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Mary	They got a word to explain things like that, when it is all right to use a word and when it isn’t, but I don’t understand it too good yet Something about a relative.” “I don’t care,” said [MASK].
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Zelda	“Maybe we can cop some cherries.” It was nighttime by the time they returned from their walk, and a game of hideandgoseek was in progress. They had long ago outgrown such games, but there seemed nothing else to do, and [MASK] was playing.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Obregdn	You may blame him for the suffering and for the killing, but that was a necessity, and the nation has been liberated and will again be liberated. [MASK] is not immortal, you know.” He stopped for a moment as an idea crossed his mind.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Richard	[MASK] took the hand that had always been at once so tender and so harsh. “I cannot keep myself from crying. Rare that always in this family I remember tears. When we are happy we cry, and when we have tragedy we cry.”
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Richard	This was happiness! EIGHT As the months went by, [MASK] was quieter, sadder, and, at times, even morose. He was aware that the family was undergoing a strange metamorphosis. The heretofore gradual assimilation of this new culture was becoming more pronounced.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Zelda	One rainy afternoon, they were all playing in the hayloft, pushing each other and wrestling on the molding straw, when suddenly one of the boys came out of the melee bleeding at the mouth. “You son of a bitch!” screamed [MASK].
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Juan	Yes. . . .Yes, your prerogative entirely, mi general. . . . Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.” He slowly put the receiver down. “He said he will personally flog me for bringing you here,” he said to [MASK].
<name>Ernie</name>	Ernie	Richard	[MASK] did not stand too close to him, because he was always trying to pants him, and he would have died of shame if he did it tonight, because he knew his BVDs were dirty at the trapdoor.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Richard	It seemed that he had all the time in the world to talk to his son, and what had happened a few minutes ago seemed forgot. “This acquaintance I spoke about, he is a writer.” “That is what I will be,” said [MASK].
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Cirilo	There was something here. He glanced at [MASK]’s wife as he ate. She was looking right at him, stared into his eyes for a moment, her face expressionless. He felt a sudden quickening in his groin. How rare! That it could happen like this.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Zelda	“This is my place!” “I’m hiding here, too,” he said. “I’m warnin’ ya,” said [MASK]. “Beat it!” When he tried to get down into the hole with her, they began to fight.
<name>Arty</name>	Arty	Richard	He died the next day. He just got a pain and died. [MASK] knew the story; his father had told him about it over and over. His mother’s lips were very wet when he kissed her, and they did not smell too good.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Richard	Instead, he started saying things to him to make everybody laugh, like “Why don’t you go home and eat some tortillas,” and [MASK] told him he had just finished eating, and anyway he did not see anything funny about it, because he liked tortillas better than bread any old day.
<name>Sodapop</name>	Sodapop	Mary	What you got against him, huh, anyhow?” “I just can’t go the sucker! You know how I hate to fight, but if he wasn’t [MASK]’s brother, I would have taken him a long time ago.”
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Richard	[MASK] was walking away by then, and the man followed him. “I’ll give ya seven-fifty and the Jap a fin.” “No, thanks.” He kept walking. They would never be able to make him do anything like that.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Joao	They would give names of relatives and friends, in the hope of finding a mutuality that would bring him closer to them in this alien land, but [MASK] disappointed them by recognizing few names and not knowing any of the people at all.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	For the first time in months, [MASK] recognized the tender look of longing in her face, and he knew that she had had a happiness in that remote land, in spite of the things she said of late.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Luz	he shouted. “If I am a whore, it is having your blood that makes me one!” [MASK] stood up to him, shouting back. “What hour is this—three o’clock in the morning—for a decent girl to be coming home?”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	“Stop swearing at me,” she said angrily. “All right, [MASK],” he said, and handed her his handkerchief. “I’m sorry.” She wiped her eyes and sat silent. After a time, he asked her if she was angry with him.
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Richard	On the bed, [MASK] heard the sound of the automobile fade away. Forgive me, my father, he thought. Forgive me because I cannot really talk with you, and for my transgressions against you. And I am sorry your life is very nearly spent.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richard	They were full of fantastic theories on what would happen to them if they overindulged. The big barn in [MASK]’s back yard became the rendezvous for the neighborhood adolescents. They clambered up into the hayloft, where they would release their desires, sometimes engaging in speed contests as an added incentive.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Richard	You’re so scared you’re shaking!” [MASK] gave him a look of hurt dignity. He was not crying, now that he knew he was past the most dangerous part of this thing in which he had somehow become involved, but his voice quavered.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ricky	They told them that it was just a feeling and that they were too little to get it yet. It was nighttime almost, and the big guys were standing by the gas station talking. They were going to a hookshop, they said, and he and [MASK] wanted to know what it was.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Luz	“Every year, more and more of us decide to remain here in the valley.” “They are funny,” said [MASK], who, along with two or three of the girls, had come into the kitchen.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richard	She did not have girl friends, because she had never associated with girls and now found their talk silly and boring, so she strove instead to become interested in the things [MASK] liked. She thought reading was laborious and painful, put persevered and found enjoyment.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richard	“Hoo, that shows how much you know. That is only in the moving pictures, but if you knew anything about horses, you would know that a good horse is not chosen for his color.” [MASK] teased his father.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richard	[MASK] looked at his father with a new respect. It was not like the innate respect he had for him because he was his father; rather, it was something real, for an abstract— an understanding, perhaps.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Zelda	“They shouldn’t’ve done that,” he said. “Why not?” asked a boy. “It’s against the law for an old bastard like that to run around sticking girls!” “The hell it was,” said [MASK].
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Luz	“Go!” he said to the little girl. “Go and bring my sisters here—and [MASK], too.” “But her head smells of coal oil,” protested his mother. “She cannot go out among her neighbors smelling like that.”
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Juan	“I know what the General was to you—what he was to your people. And, believe me, I, too, want no part of what these men will propose.” “Thank you,” said [MASK]. “Let me move.”
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Ronnie	We’re gonna ’nitiate ya.” “What do you mean?” asked [MASK] warily. “We’re gonna pants ya, stoopid!” The boy started to run, and she shouted, “Hold ’im, ya guys!”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Zelda	Then he cast a surreptitious glance over his shoulder, lest someone had seen him knocking hell out of the air. He passed [MASK]’s house, and his heart beat suddenly faster, for fear that she might come out and beat his cu off. Someday . . .
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Rene	A second man, younger than the others, spoke. “I know you,” he said. “I have seen you before.” “You know me?” asked [MASK], a look of fear momentarily crossing his face.
<name>Youssef</name>	Youssef	Richard	For sure he will be blind one of these days,” she said. “Blind? Bah! The boy is learning to see by reading in the poor light.” And he turned to [MASK] and said, “Learn, my son.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Richard	He snapped his fingers. “No, not just like that. I knew it a long time ago, the first time I went to your house. Don’t laugh at me, [MASK], and please don’t swear.” “I’m sorry.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Richard	Then, “I guess I love ya, [MASK].” Jeez, he thought. Twice on the same day! He felt extremely good. “You’re my girl now,” he said. “You’re going to have to be different from now on.
<name>Marget</name>	Marget	Mario	“I did no such thing,” said [MASK]. “He himself threw it on the ground when he went away. I but put it aside, out of the way of the children, for I knew he must come back to get it.”
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Luz	‘Tell me where you were!” he insisted. ‘This is still my house, and as long as you are in it, you answer to me!” “Wake up!” screamed [MASK], and her face was ugly. ‘This your house!”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Will	She can’t insult him by telling him it’s dirty.” She gave him a look of scathing reproach. “He was good enough to lend her a load of germs, that’s what he was,” she said. “And listen to me, [MASK].
<name>Arcturus</name>	Arcturus	Mamd	If I do ruin them, it would be worth it, for I do not need eyes where I go then. I travel, [MASK]. I travel all over the world, and sometimes out of this whole universe, and I go back in time and again forward.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Ren6	‘Then we are finished,” said [MASK]. “Our work here is done, my friends, for we have lost the one man who could have taken the ragged and the hungry, the lame—and, yes, even the blind into the fight once more.
<name>Emilio</name>	Emilio	Mario	There were more men with him now, and one of them saw the rifle and brought it to a big man who was the sheriff. The sheriff spoke, and it amazed [MASK] that this man so far from his own country could speak Spanish.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	In this new routine, [MASK] lost part of the restlessness that had tortured him for so long. He still felt the need for that unknown; that substantiality that had eluded men from the beginning of time, but it lost its importance for the present.
<name>Yankees</name>	Yankees	Obregon	Fanatic, yes, he had been a fanatic for he went about it like a fanatic, but only for that reason—not for killing [MASK]. That ennobled the killer, but his stupidity in getting himself killed made him a fanatic.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Genevie	“What about him?” he asked. “Probably just Portagee gossip!” “He gave [MASK] the works!” Something like this could not be a rumor. There must be some basis for its being said. His first thought was. Good!
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Ricky	And they were hurt also, but such a betrayal by [MASK] was not entirely unexpected. An officer! And all their older brothers ever wrote home about the service was what big pricks officers were, and now their buddy was going to be an officer!
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Pap£.	Are we so rich that our food can be thrown away?” “No, [MASK] It is only that I don’t feel good. I am worried about my mother.” “Do not worry, son.” He did not sound mean this time.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	May.	The father laughed, and said, “Come now, [MASK] The kid wasn’t far wrong. You are making a snob out of our boy.” “Because I teach him he’s better than the riffraff around here?” she asked angrily.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Luz	Then he noticed that his sister [MASK] sat in a car in front of the house, talking to a boy from school whom he vaguely knew. Inside the house, he was suddenly filled with sorrow mingled with disgust, as he always was these days when he came home.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Richard	“Tell me all about it.” [MASK] almost laughed, because now he was being conned; and he suddenly realized that this was the last of it and the detective would not hold them, because he had nothing to keep them on.
<name>Ramona</name>	Ramona	Mary	“They talk funny—Spanish he called it. I’m going to learn to talk that way.” “I knew a feller once who knew the lingo,” said her father. The mother went to the kitchen, and [MASK] climbed on her father’s knee.
<name>Despair</name>	Despair	Silly	He had slowly dropped into oblivion even in his mind, the one place where once he had soared above the multitude. What to do? What to do? Even death I can think of, he thought. But, no, not death—the finality of it. [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Zamora	His face was pale, and he said that which he knew was not true. “You lie, son of a bitch! You lie! I do not know your motives, but you liel” ‘The details, man,” said [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richard	When the sheriff and his deputies arrived, [MASK] stayed beside his father. Policemen frightened him, and he thought his father would be arrested. The sheriff told the men to go to work, but they ignored him. The road was public domain, and he lacked the authority to make them leave.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richard	They took seats, and [MASK] waited for things to begin. First they would play that march on the old graphophone while everyone stood, and then they would all sing their own songs. Words had been written to the tunes of popular songs of the day and to old favorites.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Richard	“Help yourself,” he said casually, and walked toward an old man who was talking to [MASK]’s father. “They told me I’d find you here,” he said, and embraced the old man warmly. “How are you, my son?
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Consuelo	The house was unkempt and the father complained, but [MASK], who had always been proud of her talents for housekeeping, now took the dirty house as a symbol of her emancipation, and it was to remain that way until her death.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Richard	“You can eat at my place, so you don’t have to go all the way home and back.” “Okay,” [MASK] said, “but your old lady is gonna spaghetti me to death.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Richard	Don’t lose it,” he said. It was a doubledup bicycle chain, one end bound tightly with leather thongs to form a grip. [MASK] held it in his hands and, for an unaccountable reason, said, “Thank you.” Goddamn!
<name>Two-Bit</name>	Two-Bit	Richard	It’s no fun going up there unless all the gang goes. Like old times.” Jesus! Did he have to say that? “I can’t see paying two bucks for a couple of minutes of fun,” said [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Richard	He kept moving toward then in one motion, and as [MASK] was the closest to him, he got it first, in the face, and the back of his head hit the brick wall and he slid down to the sidewalk.
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Ronnie	“We want to play, too,” he said. “Watcher name?” When the boy did not immediately answer, she added, “You gotta name, ain’tcha?” “I’m [MASK], I’m ten.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Richard	I spent all my time in the library, reading the classics.” “What are they?” asked [MASK]. “The greatest books ever written. You cannot imagine how large the library was at the university.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Protestants	“It’s all right for [MASK] to read it, but it’s a mortal sin for us heathens. I’m going to finish it before I tell the priest, though. And, boy, will I get it then!”
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	Now, you’re going to tell me! What were you doing by that car?” [MASK] decided to keep silent, like the others, and the detective left the room. Then a cop began taking them one by one.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mary	asked [MASK]. “Out the pit. I got most all my books there, too.” “What’s the pit?” “The city dump. People throw all kinds of things out there. If you want to go the next time I go.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Ricky	You had to ruin it, you’re so dumb! You think you’re such a smart guy, and just like that you killed one of the nicest things we both have!” He threw his cone at [MASK]. “What’s the matter with you?
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Richard	For that I am happy. I am sorry only that you will not speak to me now, that you do not try to understand me as a man, because it pleases you to think of me as a child at this moment,” said [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ricky	More than ever he knew they could never be friends again, because somehow he represented an obstacle to the attainment of certain goals [MASK] had imposed upon his life. He stopped crying then, because it was not worth crying for people.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Juan	He looked at [MASK] with pride and respect, and there was a quality almost of possessiveness in his attitude as he spoke. “You have never told me that before. There are not many of you left.” “You have never asked me before.”
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Thomas	He thought back to the pictures in Ring Magazine and tried to imitate the poses, but before he could really decide which he liked best, [MASK] was all over him. He kind of clinched and said, “What the hell you trying to do, you crazy bastard?”
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Richard	Always he tells me that, and he never takes me out of school to work, the way the other men do with their children,” said [MASK]. “I know. But he talks aloud to drown out the thoughts in his head and the knowledge in his heart.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Richard	As they ran to hide, [MASK] followed her. She chose as her hiding place an indentation in the earth about two feet deep. which had been made by the removal of an old oak stump. The grass was tall, and it was dark in the empty lot.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Maml	He has never hit me since we came to this country, but then he knows better than to try that!” There was a smugness in her voice that he had never heard before. “What do you mean, [MASK]?” he asked.
<name>Francisco</name>	Francisco	Richard	She thought for a moment. “Maybe he seems to be funny because he’s going to be a minister.” “A minister!” [MASK] laughed. The idea was so ridiculous to him that he said, in Spanish, “jEse no lo sera!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Victor	“Come on,” [MASK] said. They had to go a quarter of a mile before they found a suitable place to park the truck. When they returned, the first load of pears was ready to leave for the packing house. The men were milling around the driveway.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Richard	“If that’s so,” said [MASK], “then it’s my right to not vote if I don’t want to vote, isn’t it?” The man dropped it. “This little girl I was telling you about . . .
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Mat	The townspeople demanded help from the county, and learned that their success in this was greater if it was done collectively, rather than individually, so the Unemployed Council was born. [MASK]’s barn was cleaned and used as a meeting place and headquarters for the organization.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Richard	And [MASK] knew that although his father was not one of the vanquished, as he claimed, there was little resistance left. He was disappointed, and suddenly afraid, that a man who had lived such a life as his father could call this existence happiness.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Ricky	“Boy, you must,” said [MASK]. “You really must. If I didn’t work with you, I probably wouldn’t get to see you at all. Even at work, you never want to talk to a guy any more.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Richard	It was not an uncommon sight to see a truck lying on its side, with men scurrying antlike, back and forth, carrying pilfered food to their homes. [MASK] was often nearby, not showing his impatience, quietly calculating until he saw what he wanted.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Richard	[MASK] knew of it and was ashamed, but did not blame his father, and no longer blamed his mother, because everything was so wrong, and he was to blame as much as anyone else, and no one could do a thing about it.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Joe	“And [MASK]’s dead.” He waved his arms in a helpless gesture and, in his frustration, ordered the road cleared. He was in an uncomfortable position, he knew, for the people were not itinerant laborers, but lived in town and were taxpayers.
<name>Tex</name>	Tex	Richard	After a bit, he asked, “How about you, [MASK]. What’re you gonna be? You got ideas already, haven’t you?” "Yeah, I got ideas—like hitting that guy up there with a brick.”
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Ricky	“Aw, he’s all right. Just got the bighead, that’s all,” said [MASK]. “Hey,” he asked as an afterthought, “you ain’t been fooling around that little kid, have you? Honest?”
<name>Why</name>	Why	WTiy	“Because the day you do, I will leave your side forever!” She was talking to him, but he walked away from her. There is hate in my mother, he thought. Why? [MASK] is she changing so?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Mam£	“[MASK], does my father really know about horses?” “That is the one thing he does know, son—that and about women,” she said. “I do not think that there is anybody in the whole world who knows as much about those things as he does.”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Richard	“Then your fruit’ll rot, ’cause none of us will work for less’n twenty!” The girl had been sitting on the bumper of a car talking to [MASK]. She got up and returned to her father’s side. “Listen,” she said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	[MASK] was horrified. “You shouldn’t say things like that! You know teachers are the smartest people there are.” “Okay, if you say so,” he said. He turned away from her. “Is it true what she said?
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Richard	“There isn’t anything to tell,” he said, and the officer made a little joke about how [MASK] was the only one who would speak up, and how that showed he was not afraid, like the others—though he knew all along it was just the opposite.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Richard	You know exactly where I am,” answered [MASK]. “Will you help this young lady select a book?” She turned to the girl and smiled. “Go ahead. He’ll help you.” Goddamn kid, she thought; he was always disconcerting her.
<name>Heavens</name>	Heavens	Barbarians	“She said by the legs.” “The ruffians! [MASK]!” The mother was highly incensed. “I knew we shouldn’t have come to this place. Living with this foreign element. Maybe there isn’t even a church for us here!”
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Richard	“[MASK]!” she exclaimed. He was surprised. “Well, what do you call it, then?” he asked. “Manure,” she said. “You don’t have to always be vulgar.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Papi	He was angry now that his son questioned his authority. “Yes, [MASK], but can you not see that I cannot stand living this way?” He knew he was doing wrong by every standard his father believed in, but he could not stop talking.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	Every one of us has his own meaning of the word ‘better’ —his own meaning of any word. So I have fought that feeling all my life, even though I was always taught I was superior to those around me. “You see, [MASK], there is much more to it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richard	[MASK] went out to the back yard to a point where he could see into the room. The bed was by the door, and it was not really dark yet, so he could see him very plainly on the bed.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mexican	Always worried about his being [MASK] and he never even thought about it, except sometimes, when he was alone, he got kinda funnyproud about it. As he walked toward home with the guys, he thought about the things he had just discovered.
<name>Marjory</name>	Marjory	Richard	He waited until she had disappeared, and then said, “I will tell you, [MASK]. It will not matter that you do not understand. I have tried too long to forget it, and cannot. It will do me good to speak of it.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richard	“And you’re being mean!” [MASK] realized he had been cruel, and besides he was easily defeated by tears. “Okay, okay!” he said placatingly, trying to restore the harmony that was lost. “So I admit I’m wrong.
