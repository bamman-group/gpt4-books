<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Okonkwo	His wives and children were very happy too, and so were his cousins and their wives when he sent for them and told them who his guest was. "You must take him to salute our father," said one of the cousins. "Yes," replied [MASK].
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Okonkwo	"You know very well, [MASK], that I am not afraid of blood,- and if anyone tells you that 1 am, he is telling a lie. And let me tell you one thing, my friend. If I were you I would have stayed at home.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	Violent deaths were frequent, but nothing like this had ever happened. The only course open to [MASK] was to flee from the clan. It was a crime against the earth goddess to kill a clansman, and a man who committed it must flee from the land.
<name>Obierika</name>	Obierika	Obierika	[MASK] again drank a little of his wine. "And so they killed the white man and tied his iron horse to their sacred tree because it looked as if it would run away to call the man's friends. I forgot to tell you another thing which the Oracle said.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	He exchanged greetings with [MASK] and led the way into his obi. "1 was coming over to see you as soon as I finished that thatch," he said, rubbing off the grains of sand that clung to his thighs. "Is it well?"
<name>Nwoye</name>	Nwoye	Nwoye	He went into the obi and saluted his father, but he did not answer. [MASK] turned round to walk into the inner compound when his father, suddenly overcome with fury, sprang to his feet and gripped him by the neck. "Where have you been?" he stammered.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	[MASK] had committed the female, because it had been inadvertent. He could return to the clan after seven years. That night he collected his most valuable belongings into head-loads. His wives wept bitterly and their children wept with them without knowing why.
<name>Thon</name>	Thon	Agbala	No one had ever beheld [MASK], except his priestess. But no one who had ever crawled into his awful shrine had come out without the fear of his power. His priestess stood by the sacred fire which she built in the heart of the 17 cave and proclaimed the will of the god.
<name>Obierika</name>	Obierika	Obierika	A bowl of pounded yams can throw him in a wrestling match. His two younger brothers are more promising. But 1 can tell you, [MASK], that my children do not resemble me. Where are the young suckers that will grow when the old banana tree dies?
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Iweka	"My son has told me about you, and I am happy you have come to see us. I knew your father, [MASK]. He was a great man. He had many friends here and came to see them quite often.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	And many more people were coming from every quarter of the nine villages. It warmed [MASK]'s heart to see such strength of numbers. But he was looking for one man in particular, the man whose tongue he dreaded and despised so much. "Can you see him?"
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	And they might also have noticed that [MASK] was not among the titled men and elders who sat behind the row of egwugwu. But if they thought these things they kept them within themselves. The ec)wuc)wu with the springy walk was one of the dead fathers of the clan.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Obierika	The hole would not let a man through. It was to this bush that [MASK] led the Commissioner and his men. They skirted round the compound, keeping close to the wall. The only sound they made was with their feet as they crushed dry leaves.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	As the day wore on his in-laws arrived from three surrounding villages, and each party brought with them a huge pot of palm-wine. And there was eating and drinking till night, when [MASK]'s in-laws began to leave for their homes.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	He could fashion out flutes from bamboo stems and even from the elephant grass. He knew the names of all the birds and could set clever traps for the little bush rodents. And he knew which trees made the strongest bows. Even [MASK] himself became very fond of the boy— inwardly of course.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nwakibie	He had one consolation. The yams he had sown before the drought were his own, the harvest of the previous year. He still had the eight hundred from [MASK] and the four hundred from his father's friend. So he would make a fresh start.
<name>Kambili</name>	Kambili	Ezinma	After her father's rebuke she developed an even keener appetite for eggs. And she enjoyed above all the secrecy in which she now ate them. Her mother always took her into their bedroom and shut the door. [MASK] did not call her mother Nne like all children.
<name>Nyasha</name>	Nyasha	Ezinma	He passed her a piece of fish. "Go and bring me some cold water," he said. [MASK] rushed out of the hut, chewing the fish, and soon returned with a bowl of cool water from the earthen pot in her mother's hut.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Nwoye	It was only from [MASK]'s mother that he heard scraps of the story. The arrival of the missionaries had caused a considerable stir in the village of Mbanta. There were six of them and one was a white man. Every man and woman came out to see the white man.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	The oldest man present said sternly that those whose palm-kernels were cracked for them by a benevolent spirit should not forget to be humble. [MASK] said he was sorry for what he had said, and the meeting continued. 27
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Okonkwo	I have come to pay you my respects and also to ask a favor. But let us drink the wine first." Everybody thanked [MASK] and the neighbors brought out their drinking horns from the goatskin bags they carried.
<name>Mma</name>	Mma	Ezinma	Because of her size she made her way through trees and creepers more quickly than her followers. The bush was alive with the tread of feet on dry leaves and sticks and the moving aside of tree branches. [MASK] went deeper and deeper and the crowd went with her.
<name>John</name>	John	Okonkwo	"So you must finish this." She sat down and stretched her legs in front of 64 her. [MASK] ate the food absent-mindedly. 'She should have been a boy,' he thought as he looked at his ten-year-old daughter.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	She set the pot on the fire and [MASK] took up his machete to return to his obi. "You must watch the pot carefully,” he said as he went, "and don't allow it to boil over. If it does its power will be gone."
<name>Once</name>	Once	Eneke	So we must do what our fathers would never have done. [MASK] the bird was asked why he was always on the wing and he replied: 'Men have learned to 204 shoot without missing their mark and I have learned to fly without perching on a twig.'
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Nwoye	[MASK]'s mother went to him and placed her hands on his chest and on his back. He was ill for three market weeks, and when he recovered he seemed to have overcome his great fear and sadness. He was by nature a very lively boy
<name>Nwoye</name>	Nwoye	Nwoye	The drums begin at noon but the wrestling waits until the sun begins to sink. Go and see if your father has brought out yams for the afternoon." "He has. [MASK]'s mother is already cooking." "Go and bring our own, then.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Obierika	And as if they had been waiting for that, [MASK]'s relatives and friends began to arrive, every man with his goatskin bag hung on one shoulder and a rolled goatskin mat under his arm. Some of them were accompanied by their sons bearing carved wooden stools.
<name>Umuofia</name>	Umuofia	Mbanta	That night a bell-man went through the length and breadth of [MASK] proclaiming that the adherents of the new faith were thenceforth excluded from the life and privileges of the clan. The Christians had grown in number and were now a small community of men, women and children, self-assured and confident.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	Some days later, when the land had been moistened by two or three heavy rains, [MASK] and his family went to the farm with baskets of seed-yams, their hoes and machetes, and the planting began.
<name>Nwoye</name>	Nwoye	Okonkwo	But he was happy to leave his father. He would return later to his mother and his brothers and sisters and convert them to the new faith. As [MASK] sat in his hut that night, gazing into a log fire, he thought over the matter.
<name>Tsotsi</name>	Tsotsi	Ezinma	But you said it was where they bury children?" asked the medicine man. "No," said [MASK], whose feeling of importance was manifest in her sprightly walk. She sometimes broke into a run and stopped again suddenly. The crowd followed her silently.
<name>Ezeulu</name>	Ezeulu	Ezeudu	It was a great funeral, such as befitted a noble warrior. As the evening drew near, the shouting and the firing of guns, the 123 beating of drums and the brandishing and clanging of machetes increased. [MASK] had taken three titles in his life.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Nwoye	He 152 seized a heavy stick that lay on the dwarf wall and hit him two or three savage blows. "Answer me!" he roared again. [MASK] stood looking at him and did not say a word. The women were screaming outside, afraid to go in.
<name>He</name>	He	Okonkwo	It was only when he had got there that it had occurred to him that the priestess might have chosen to go round the villages first. [MASK] had returned home and sat waiting. When he thought he had waited long enough he again returned to the shrine.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	This year they were the wise ones. They sympathized with their neighbors with much shaking of the head, but inwardly they were happy for what they took to be their own foresight. 24 [MASK] planted what was left of his seed-yams when the rains finally returned.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Okonkwo	"I remember when I was a young boy there was a song about them. He could not do anything without telling her." "I did not know that," said [MASK]. "1 thought he was a strong man in his youth."
<name>Ezinma</name>	Ezinma	Ezinma	She prepared it the way he liked—— with slices of oil-bean and fish. "You have not eaten for two days," said his daughter [MASK] when she brought the food to him. "So you must finish this."
<name>Ananse</name>	Ananse	Ukegbu	But as the dog said, 'If I fall down for you and you fall down for me, it is play'. Marriage should be a play ;.nd not a fight; so we are falling down again." He then added ten sticks to the fifteen and gave the bundle to [MASK].
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Okonkwo	His love of talk had grown with age and sickness. It tried [MASK]'s patience beyond words. Chapter Four "Looking at a king's mouth," said an old man, "one would think he never sucked at his mother's breast."
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Danda	akwa oligholi Ebe [MASK] nechi eze Ebe Uzuzu nete egwu Sala He sang it in his mind, and walked to its beat. If the song ended on his right foot, his mother was alive. If it ended on his left, she was dead.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	I know more about the world than any of you. If there is any one among you who thinks he knows more let him speak up." He paused, but no one spoke. "Why is [MASK] with us today? This is not his clan.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Ikezue	Dusk was already approaching when their contest began. The drums went mad and the crowds also. They surged forward as the two young men danced into the circle. The palm fronds were helpless in keeping them back. [MASK] held out his right hand.
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Ekwefi	It was [MASK]'s turn to tell a story. "Once upon a time," she began, "all the birds were invited to a feast in the sky. They were very happy and began to prepare themselves for the great day.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Obierika	[MASK] was a man who thought about things. When the will of the goddess had been done, he sat down in his obi and mourned his friend's calamity. Why should a man suffer so grievously for an offense he had committed inadvertently?
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	He rose and left the hut. [MASK] did as the priest said. He also took with him a pot of palm-wine. Inwardly, he was repentant. But he was not the man to go about telling his neighbors that he was in error.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Okonkwo	And supporting his mother also meant supporting his father. She could not be expected to cook and eat while her husband starved. And so at a very early age when he was striving desperately to build a barn through share-cropping [MASK] was also fending for his father's house.
<name>Ekwefi</name>	Ekwefi	Ekwefi	When his wife [MASK] protested that two goats were sufficient for the feast he told her that it was not her affair. "I am calling a feast because I have the wherewithal. I cannot live on the bank of a river and wash my hands with spittle.
<name>Zadkiel</name>	Zadkiel	Okagbue	[MASK] was a very striking figure, tall, with a full beard and a bald head. He was light in complexion and his eyes were red and fiery. He always gnashed his teeth as he listened to those who came to consult him.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Okonkwo	And so no one had seen the approach of the five court messengers until they had come round the bend, a few paces from the edge of the crowd. [MASK] was sitting at the edge. He sprang to his feet as soon as he saw who it was.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Enoch	[MASK] was short and slight of build, and always seemed in great haste. His feet were short and broad, and when he stood or walked his heels came together and his feet opened outwards as if they had quarreled and meant to go in different directions.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	The drums beat the unmistakable wrestling dance —quick, light and gay, and it came floating on the wind. [MASK] cleared his throat and moved his feet to the beat of the drums. It filled him with fire as it had always done from his youth.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	When [MASK] heard that he would not eat any food he came into the hut with a big stick in his hand 28 and stood over him while he swallowed his yams, trembling. A few moments later he went behind the hut and began to vomit painfully.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	Some of them were accompanied by their sons bearing carved wooden stools. [MASK] was 116 one of them. They sat in a half-circle and began to talk of many things. It would not be long before the suitors came.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Obierika	The children made endless trips to the stream. Three young men helped [MASK] to slaughter the two goats with which the soup was made. They were very fat goats, but the fattest of all was tethered to a peg near the wall of the compound.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ekwefi	Her back was turned on the footpath that led out of the hills. She must have heard a noise behind her and turned round sharply. A man stood there with a machete in his hand. [MASK] uttered a scream and sprang to her feet.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Unoka	[MASK] was an ill-fated man. He had a bad chi or personal god, and evil fortune followed him to the grave, or rather to his death, for he had no grave. He died of the swelling which was an abomination to the earth goddess.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	If ever a man deserved his success, that man was [MASK]. At an early age he had achieved fame as the greatest wrestler in all the land. That was not luck. At the most one could say that his chi or personal god was good.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	The missionary ignored him and went on to talk about the Holy Trinity. At the end of it [MASK] was fully convinced that the man was mad. He shrugged his shoulders and went away to tap his afternoon palm-wine. But there was a young lad who had been captivated.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Ekwefi	[MASK] brought her to the fireplace, spread her mat on the floor and built a fire. But she had got worse and worse. As she knelt by her, feeling with her palm the wet, burning forehead, she prayed a thousand times.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Obierika	She saw the other children with their water-pots and remembered that they were going to fetch water for [MASK]'s wife. She went back to the hut and brought her pot. “Have you slept enough?" asked her mother. "Yes," she replied.
<name>Kino</name>	Kino	Nwoye	"Those that hear my words are my father and my mother." [MASK] did not fully understand. But he was happy to leave his father. He would return later to his mother and his brothers and sisters and convert them to the new faith.
<name>she</name>	she	Ezinma	When he had swallowed them, he took up the rag with his left hand and began to untie it. And then the smooth, shiny pebble fell out. He picked it up. "Is this yours?" he asked [MASK]. "Yes," she replied.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ekwefi	"They are young tubers." "They are not all that young," said [MASK]. "I planted the 165 farm nearly two years ago. It is a poor soil and that is why the tubers are so small."
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Nwankwo	He could not understand it until he looked back and saw that what he led at the end of the tether was not a goat but a heavy log of wood." "Do you think a thief can do that kind of thing single-handed?" asked [MASK].
<name>shiftless</name>	shiftless	agbala	It was the fear of himself, lest he should be found to resemble his father. Even as a little boy he had resented his father's failure and weakness, and even now he still remembered how he had suffered when a playmate had told him that his father was [MASK].
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	He listened carefully, and could just hear the criers voice. But it was very faint. He turned on his bed and his back hurt him. He ground his teeth. The crier was drawing nearer and nearer until he passed by [MASK]'s compound. "
<name>Ani</name>	Ani	Ifejioku	I also kill a cock at the shrine of [MASK], the god of yams. I clear the bush and set fire to it when it is dry. I sow the yams when the first rain has fallen, and stake them when the young tendrils appear.
<name>Ezinma</name>	Ezinma	Akueke	[MASK] moved to the other end of the hut and began to remove the waist-beads. It had to be done slowly and carefully, taking each string separately, else it would break and the 71 thousand tiny rings would have to be strung together again.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	It was like the good old days again, when a warrior was a warrior. Although they had not agreed to kill the missionary or drive away the Christians, they had agreed to do something substantial. And they had done it. [MASK] was almost happy again.
<name>She</name>	She	Ezinma	[MASK] asked after a suitable interval. "Yes," he answered. "Will you go?" "Yes.” And after a pause she said: "Can I bring your chair for you?" "No, that is a boy's job.
<name>Adaku</name>	Adaku	Chielo	She began to run, holding her breasts with her hands to stop them flapping noisily against her body. She hit her left foot against an outcropped root, and terror seized her. It was an ill omen. She ran faster. But [MASK]'s voice was still a long way away.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	If one says no to the other, let his wing break." After the kola nut had been eaten [MASK] brought his palm-wine from the corner of the hut where it had been placed and stood it in the center of the group.
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Ikemefuna	It descended on him again, this feeling, when his father walked in, that night after killing [MASK]. Chapter Eight wine from morning till night, and his eyes were red and fierce like the eyes of a rat when it was caught by the tail and dashed against the floor.
<name>Anandi</name>	Anandi	Ekwefi	She went back to the hut and brought her pot. “Have you slept enough?" asked her mother. "Yes," she replied. "Let us go." 112 "Not before you have had your breakfast," said [MASK].
<name>Mei</name>	Mei	Ezinma	"Your chi is very much awake, my friend. And how is my daughter, [MASK]?" "She has been very well for some time now. Perhaps she has come to stay." "I think she has. How old is she now?"
<name>Macandal</name>	Macandal	Kotma	As they cut grass in the morning the younger men sang in time with the strokes of their machetes: "[MASK] of the ash buttocks, He is Jit to be a slave. The white man has no sense, He is fit to be a slave."
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Okonkwo	The crier's voice had once more become faint, and the distance had taken the harsh edge off his iron gong. [MASK] turned from one side to the other and derived a kind of pleasure from the pain his back gave him. "
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Okonkwo	The elders sat in a big circle and the singers went round singing each man's praise as they came before him. They had something to say for every man. Some were great farmers, some were orators who spoke for the clan,- [MASK] was the greatest wrestler and warrior alive.
<name>Ezeulu</name>	Ezeulu	Okonkwo	"It wounds my heart to see these young men killing palm trees in the name of tapping." "It is so indeed," [MASK] agreed. "But the law of the land must be obeyed."
<name>Anyanwu</name>	Anyanwu	Ojiugo	There was nobody in the hut and the fireplace was cold. "Where is [MASK]?" he asked his second wife, who came out of her hut to draw water from a gigantic pot in the shade of a small tree in the middle of the compound.
<name>Akueke</name>	Akueke	Nwoye	A sudden hush had fallen on the women, who had been talking, and they had quickened their steps. [MASK] had heard that twins were put in earthenware pots and thrown 62 away in the forest, but he had never yet come across them.
<name>Tortoise</name>	Tortoise	Obierika	She beckons in front of her and behind her, to her right and to her left." "And so everybody comes," said another man, "honest men and thieves. They can steal your cloth from off your waist in that market." "Yes," said [MASK].
<name>Nyasha</name>	Nyasha	Nwoye	There was a light wind blowing, so she cupped her right hand to shelter the flame. [MASK]'s mother, also carrying an oil lamp, emerged from her hut. The children stood in the darkness outside their hut watching the strange event.
<name>Tortoise</name>	Tortoise	Tortoise	They painted their bodies with red cam wood and drew beautiful patterns on them with uli. "[MASK] saw all these preparations and soon discovered what it all meant. Nothing that happened in the world of the animals ever escaped his notice,- he was full of cunning.
<name>Adaku</name>	Adaku	Anasi	[MASK] was a middle-aged woman, tall and strongly built. There was authority in her bearing and she looked every inch the ruler of the womenfolk in a large and prosperous family. She wore the anklet of her husband's titles, which the first wife alone could wear.
<name>Mumbo</name>	Mumbo	Ekwensu	turned to the long rope he trailed behind. He sang, in a terrifying voice, that [MASK], or Evil Spirit, had entered his eye. But the most dreaded of all was yet to come. He was always alone and was shaped like a coffin.
<name>Adaku</name>	Adaku	Ekwefi	[MASK] had been returning from the stream with her mother on a dark night like this when they saw its glow as it flew in their direction. They had thrown down their water-pots and lain by the roadside expecting the sinister light to descend on them and kill them.
<name>Ezinma</name>	Ezinma	Ezinma	As each of the six men got to his compound, he turned in, taking some of the crowd with him. The village was astir in a silent, suppressed way. [MASK] had prepared some food for her father as soon as news spread that the six men would be released.
<name>Anitun</name>	Anitun	Akueni	I did not hang myself, and 1 am still alive. If you think you are the greatest sufferer in the world ask my daughter, [MASK], how many twins she has borne and thrown away. Have you not heard the song they sing when a woman dies?
<name>Okeke</name>	Okeke	Obierika	She took it to him in his obi. He ate absent-mindedly. He had no appetite,-he only ate to please her. His male relations and friends had gathered in his obi, and [MASK] was urging him to eat.
<name>Mafuta</name>	Mafuta	Ezinma	"Bring me my bag," he asked, and [MASK] brought his goatskin bag from the far end of the hut. He searched in it for his snuff-bottle. It was a deep bag and took almost the whole length of his arm.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Ezinma	It filled him with fire as it had always done from his youth. He trembled with the desire to conquer and subdue. It was like the desire for woman. "We shall be late for the wrestling," said [MASK] to her mother.
<name>Uzoma</name>	Uzoma	Obierika	he asked his two companions, and they nodded their heads. "Three moons ago," said [MASK], "on an Eke market day a little band of fugitives came into our town. Most of them were sons of our land whose mothers had been buried with us.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Ezeudu	People made way for him on all sides and the noise subsided. Even the smell of gunpowder was swallowed in the sickly smell that now filled the air. He danced a few steps to the funeral drums and then went to see the corpse. "[MASK]!"
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Okonkwo	He sighed heavily, and as if in sympathy the smoldering log also sighed. And immediately [MASK]'s eyes were opened and he saw the whole matter clearly. Living fire begets cold, impotent ash. He sighed again, deeply. Chapter Eighteen
<name>Nyasha</name>	Nyasha	Ezinma	I shall give you some fish to eat." She went into the hut again and brought down the smoke-black basket in which she kept her dried fish and other ingredients for cooking soup. She broke a piece in two and gave it to [MASK], who clung to her.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Ukegbu	73 "We are at last getting somewhere," [MASK] said, and then turning to his brother and his son he said: "Let us go out and whisper together." The three rose and went outside.
<name>Nyame</name>	Nyame	Okonkwo	The rainbow was called the python of the sky. [MASK] called his three wives and told them to get things together for a great feast. "1 must thank my mother's kinsmen before 1 go," he said.
<name>Ezeulu</name>	Ezeulu	Okonkwo	This year they talked of nothing else but the nso-ani which [MASK] had committed. It was the first time for many years that a man had broken the sacred peace. Even the oldest men could only remember one or two other occasions somewhere in the dim past.
