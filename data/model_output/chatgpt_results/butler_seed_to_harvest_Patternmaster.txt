<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Joachim	He had waited so long to avoid being taken as an outsider. If now, on his first day out of the school, all his waiting was to prove in vain... "You were talking about strength," [MASK] was saying.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Iray	He had only recently eaten part of his dinner. [MASK] had been sitting up. Now she lay down beside him. He put his arm around her and drew her closer so that her head rested on his shoulder. How to say it?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Teray	[MASK] opened his mouth to give him a defiant "No!" but somehow it was not that easy to say the word that could condemn him. He dosed his mouth and stared down at his plate. Finally he found his voice. "I can't.
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Teray	He had always wanted a House of his own anyway, and he knew he'd never have one. He was almost too strong to be a teacher, but not nearly strong enough to be a Housemaster." "A stronger man would have reacted more reasonably." [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Teray	"[MASK]," she said softly, "I have to tell you—" She broke off suddenly as he looked at her. "I'm sorry," she said. "That can't mean much to you now, but I am sorry."
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Iray	And [MASK] was young—just out of school. It was one thing for her to resist the attentions of wealthy lords who came to the school, where they would flaunt little of their wealth or power before her. Where they were just other men.
<name>Laman</name>	Laman	Jansee	If he understood, he might not have had to die. I wouldn't have sacrificed one of [MASK]'s sons if he hadn't had to die. Do you really think anyone could have talked him out of wanting the Pattern? You could have, perhaps.
<name>Loki</name>	Loki	Teray	"You see? Already he proves his usefulness to me. 1 was careless about maintaining my shield, and immediately he reminded me." And to [MASK], "What else did you pick up... brother?"
<name>Fiona</name>	Fiona	Coransee	"I won't contest," he said quietly. The words were surprisingly difficult to say. To be Master of the Pattern, to hold such power... "I let you live thinking that you wouldn't." [MASK] looked across at him calculatingly.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Teray	As strong as he is, even he couldn't have done it if I had resisted. So I didn't resist. By then, I would have done anything to get free. Anything." "You call what you have now freedom?" [MASK]'s own contempt was coming through.
<name>Drottnings</name>	Drottnings	Rayal	Disease carriers that they were, they had deliberately mutilated [MASK], bitten him to give him the one disease that no Pattemist healer could cure—the Clayark disease. Were they now seeking out his children, his possible heirs, to do the same to them?
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Jackman	But on a physical parallel it was too much like slapping a child. [MASK] reeled back against the wall as though he had been hit physically. For a moment he stood still, bent slightly from the waist, his head down, cursing.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Teray	[MASK] shook his head, fearing to believe. It was too much, and far too easy. "You offer me all this at no cost? You give it to me?" "What price could you pay me?" "None. You're right.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Amber	Then she smiled ruefully. "1 was. She's not only good at bluffing, but at seeing through a bluff, so 1 had to be." "No, you didn't." She said nothing. "Stay with me, [MASK].
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Amber	"Only a small group," said [MASK]. "About twenty. They might go around the hill and pass us by." "Yes, and then they might notice our trail and follow us while one of them goes for reinforcements. Best to kill them."
<name>John</name>	John	Teray	1 hope they don't have many rifles or riflemen who can make that kind of shot." "Well, at least now they have one less." "No. We lost him." [MASK] stared at him incredulously. "All of you?
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Amber	[MASK] was not beside the fire. He looked around and saw her preparing their pallet a short distance away from the others against the ledge. He went over to her and she turned to look at him apprehensively. "I couldn't help feeling some of that through the link," she said.
<name>Big Brother</name>	Big Brother	Darah	They slept as usual since the canopy of their awareness guarded them, once set, whether they were awake or asleep. The next morning they ate a quick skimpy breakfast and rode on early. They were no longer within [MASK]'s sector but they were still close enough to it to be nervous.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Teray	"With you stronger than she is and possessing so much of her knowledge and experience... I don't think she would have dared to take you back." "I'm glad she didn't have to decide." [MASK] changed the subject abruptly.
<name>Stubbornness</name>	Stubbornness	Stubborn	"He won't." She winced. "If we weren't so close, you and I, I'd try to get you to change your mind." "No." "I know. We're alike that way. [MASK] beyond any reasoning.
<name>Sarek</name>	Sarek	Teray	However clumsily." "What do you want?" "The woman has told you what I want. I saw it in your mind when you called to me a few minutes ago." [MASK] looked away from him in silent defeat and desperation.
<name>Moiraine</name>	Moiraine	Coransee	"I'm not after the Pattern," he said. "As I told [MASK], I want my freedom and a chance to establish a House of my own. That's all." She looked at him for a long moment, one eyebrow lifted.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Teray	And I can change my mind." "No, [MASK], so I can be sure of us living at least that much longer." She spoke wearily, her words reaching him both through his ears and his mind. She was open again.
<name>Doro</name>	Doro	Rayal	Something was done to him. He was disoriented for a moment, then he lost his focus on the Pattern and found himself channeled through to [MASK] as though to a friend—as though he had simply reached out to the Patternmaster. And he was no longer held.
<name>John</name>	John	Coransee	"What's the point of buying my life with the one thing I still have that makes it worth living? Go ahead and kill me." [MASK] leaned back and shook his head. "I wish I had read you less correctly, brother.
<name>he</name>	he	Teray	"You can. I won't open to you, but I won't betray you either." "Has he hurt you? Has he done something you don't want me to...?" "No, [MASK]. Why should he hurt me?"
<name>Wesley</name>	Wesley	Rayal	They're fine. Even the one you had to knock out is still all right. They wonder what's the matter with you. They aren't the only ones. [MASK] projected amusement. You're fine. Recovering faster than I expected. You'd better be fine.
<name>Littlefinger</name>	Littlefinger	Joachim	That's common sense. When you're Master of your own House, see how you feel about accepting an underling who just might learn enough from you to snatch your House away." "Did you help [MASK] win his House from its previous Master?"
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Clayarks	He had seen pictures of [MASK] at the school, but nothing as lifelike as this. His hands could almost feel warmth and a texture of flesh. He folded his hands around the figurine, closed his eyes, and opened his mind to whatever experience awaited him.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Teray	[MASK] seized her by the shoulders and shook her. "Cut him off!" Her eyes refocused on him sharply. She sat still, glaring at him until he let her go. "If he's almost here, surely you can wait to talk to him."
<name>Cersei</name>	Cersei	Amber	He was startled to realize that it was still possible for him to like her. He shook his head and smiled briefly. "[MASK], why the hell haven't you gone out and started your own House?" "I will, sooner or later," she said.
<name>John Coffey</name>	John Coffey	Teray	A cook had dropped a pan of hot cooking grease on his foot. The foot was badly burned. [MASK] bent at once to examine the foot. He could read the man's pain on his face but he was careful not to read it in his mind.
<name>Magdalena</name>	Magdalena	Amber	She read his glance and pointed past the clusters of waiting outsiders and women. Just beyond a ragged edge of wall, he could see two outsiders working at something, digging a hole, a grave. "No," he said quietly. [MASK] looked at him.
<name>John</name>	John	Teray	"Then help us," demanded [MASK]. "We need your help, not your fear!" "I can't help you." "You mean you won't help us. No one outsider is worth the trouble you could give him for taking me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Michael	"Good," she said as she turned and saw him. "I've got to talk to you." "You came all the way up here to talk to me?" "Necessary. I have a message for you from [MASK].
<name>Zechariah</name>	Zechariah	Iray	But the restriction [MASK] had in mind was the one that said outsiders could not marry. They were free enough to have all the sex they wanted with any woman in the House who would have them—as long as they were careful to father no unauthorized offspring.
<name>she</name>	she	Amber	He tried to remember what had happened. Then it came back to him and he sat up abruptly. Too abruptly. He would have fallen back had [MASK] not been there to help him. She had come from nowhere, kneeling beside him, steadying him.
<name>Yaz</name>	Yaz	Amber	Then, knowing that he was out of his depth, he called the healer. The healer's name was [MASK]. She was a golden-brown woman with hair that was a round cap of small, tight black curls. And she had a temper.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Coransee	"You know," said [MASK] quietly, "I would have stopped you some words back if I didn't realize you were speaking out of your feelings for the woman. But even for that, you've said enough."
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Joachim	"You're asking me to step from physical slavery into mental slavery!" "I'm offering you everything you claim to want. Are you getting ambitious already? My controls would do nothing other than make certain you kept your word." "[MASK] told me how you use your controls."
<name>Death</name>	Death	Coransee	The pain continued, grew. He could have stopped it, but if he gave his attention to his body, [MASK] would be free to break down the defenses of his mind. But his heart. He was dying.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Amber	He must know about some of it at least." [MASK] looked away. "He knows. I've told him often enough myself. He won't let me do anything about it unless I give up my independence and settle here.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Kai	He looked at the truths the Housemasters had ignored, then decided in [MASK]'s favor. He didn't make them take me back, but at least he made them leave her alone." "It was too late anyway. You couldn't have gone back to her then."
<name>Lackman</name> (The passage does not provide any context clues to suggest a different name.)	Lackman (The passage does not provide any context clues to suggest a different name.)	Teray	lackman glared back at him, livid with rage. Then, slowly, the rage dissolved into weary submission. "If there was any way for me to kill you, boy, I'd do it gladly. And slowly." "I've linked us," said [MASK].
<name>Thrawn</name>	Thrawn	Coransee	I gave him some special training." "But why? And why keep control of him?" [MASK] gave him a long, calculating look. "Sector politics," he said finally. "I wanted to be certain of a majority vote on the Redhill Council of Masters.
<name>Corwin</name>	Corwin	Teray	The Housemaster had been her second when she made the difficult transition from childhood to adulthood and membership in the Pattern. She would probably have gone into his House as one of his wives if she had not met [MASK].
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Amber	It was then that he realized that it was not he who had been shot, but [MASK]. The link, fulfilling its function too well, had given him so great a share of her experience that if they had been alone he could have been shot too while he was recovering.
<name>them</name>	them	Coransee	You'll have to take my word for that." She lifted an eyebrow. "In trouble with [MASK] already, eh? I see. Well, I can't help there, but if you find that you need help with any of the others, you can call on me.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Iray	"[MASK]!" She switched in mid-sentence. "... trade you. He wouldn't. He needs you. You're the strongest man he's ever been able to fit into his House." "I didn't say he was going to trade me.
<name>David</name>	David	Teray	[MASK], watching him, felt the beginnings of fear. He had waited so long to avoid being taken as an outsider. If now, on his first day out of the school, all his waiting was to prove in vain...
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Joachim	"Then why didn't you let me try?" "You can try if you want to." [MASK] shook his head wearily. "You probably will, sooner or later, because he wants you to. He wants to know just how strong you are.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Teray	But even as he lay on the ground clutching his chest, trying to prevent himself from bleeding to death, he took his revenge. [MASK] found himself suddenly disoriented. His head hurt. His head was exploding. He tried to reach up, clutching it between his hands.
<name>Esk</name>	Esk	Coransee	[MASK] frowned, thinking. "They've captured more than one of my mutes over the years, but that last one... you're right. He would have had quite a bit to tell them. But as for the Clayark who identified you, you did kill it, didn't you?"
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Teray	Things have gone too far, young one. Too far ? You're going to have to face him. You mean you won't give me sanctuary? Not even for... [MASK] caught himself, stopped the thought.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Teray	Imagine killing thirty per cent of the Pattemists in even an average-size House. [MASK] winced away from the idea. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell him? If he understood, he might not have had to die.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Coransee	He put down the fork and looked at [MASK]. "So that's it." "That's it." "Are you going to kill me?" "If I was, you would have died last night."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Amber	I got out just ahead of the group of Housemasters that had finally—twelve hours too late—realized what was happening." [MASK] stopped talking and they rode along in silence for a while, urging the horses faster as they came to a stretch of level ground, then slowing to climb another hill.
<name>Pattemist</name>	Pattemist	Teray	Nothing else. The link isn't a control or a snoop. Just an alarm." "Like the kind some Pattemist mothers keep on their kids to be sure the kids are okay, right?" [MASK] winced. He would never have said such a thing.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Teray	No woman of his House had the right to refuse him. His women could refuse any other man if they wished, but not him. "If you want her," said [MASK], "call her yourself."
<name>He</name>	He	Teray	And... there'll only be two of us." She said nothing to that. She went on eating. They traveled southwest toward the coast and toward the nearest borders of the sector. [MASK] had decided to take the coast trail south, if he could.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Darah	"The last time I came through, [MASK] didn't have a decent healer and she looked twenty years older than she does now. Of course forty years older would be more accurate. Anyway, I helped her. I had thought of her as an old friend.
<name>Leia</name>	Leia	Teray	I only got a flash of them before I shielded, but I think I would have sensed him if he had been with them." "People from this sector, perhaps," said [MASK]. "No matter who they are, we're fair game."
<name>any proper name</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	any proper name (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Coransee	Not that he wanted [MASK] inside. He was not ready for a confrontation. He had had no time to gather his thoughts, decide what battle strategy might give him the best chance. If he had a chance at all.
<name>Brander</name>	Brander	Several	[MASK] had offered to take him on as an outsider. If he had not still been under the protection of the school, some of them might have been tempted to take him by force. Doubtless that would be possible now, while he was still young and unskilled.
<name>Tavore</name>	Tavore	Coransee	"I don't want a turn." He touched her face. "I'll try to see to it." She left, glaring at [MASK] as she passed him. She was with her ten guards before they realized that they were on duty.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Teray	"Nosing into my life isn't teaching." [MASK] sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the floor. He had thought it would be easy, that a man so clearly attached to the mutes would be willing to sacrifice a little of his mental privacy for their good.
<name>the boss</name>	the boss	Rayal	"I can see that." "So you're right. If you contest, I will have to kill you." "Others will contest. You won't just step into [MASK]'s place." "I'll worry about them when they reveal themselves.
<name>he</name>	he	Lord	" He paused. "You understand." "I... yes, [MASK]." As long as he was still alive, he had a chance. Or did he think that only because he wanted so badly to live? No, there was a chance.
<name>Lady Brandon</name>	Lady Brandon	Darah	Lady?" he asked. She said nothing but her people looked more alert. He nodded. "I thought not. I have no more time for you." He whipped his horse forward suddenly, sending it straight into [MASK] and her companions.
<name>the entire court</name>	the entire court	Iray	"No chance at all. In a few years, maybe, when you've had more training, more experience, when you leam more control. But now... he'll humiliate you before the rest of his House, before [MASK]."
<name>Reinhold</name>	Reinhold	Clayarks	He came up to them, but his people stayed back, still mounted, apparently watching for [MASK]. "I don't suppose you persuaded him to submit." "I didn't try." "And you're staying with him.
<name>Dumas</name>	Dumas	Rayal	I... do you intend to keep her?" "Yes." "I was afraid you did. If [MASK]'s findings free me, will you let me buy her?" "Buy her with what?" "With service, brother, work.
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Teray	"Why did you do that? What's the matter with you?" "You want me to stay linked to you while I'm with him?" Understanding, [MASK] grimaced. For the second time that day, their extreme closeness made the link a handicap. "
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joachim	She jumped, and looked around like a person just waking up. Then she saw him and put the stone aside. "I think you may have come home just in time," she said. "Why? What's going on?" "Your friend [MASK].
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Rayal	Release only their strength. Keep your links with them. What am I being careful of? he asked coldly. You or my people? He would never forgive the old man for refusing him help when he needed it so desperately. [MASK] picked up his thought.
<name>Moiraine</name>	Moiraine	Rayal	/ will never gather the strength of the Pattern in my mind again, sent [MASK]. It would kill me. When the need arises next, young one, the Pattern will be yours. That will kill me, too, but at least I'll die alone—not take thousands of people with me.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Coransee	And it was good, and I'm home. I'm going to stay here." There was nothing he could say to her that would not twist back and indict him, too. Even his anger was more at his own helplessness, and at [MASK], than at her.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Amber	You'd better link up with me again, because when he hits you, I'm going to hit him. If we aren't linked, one of us is liable to get killed, without doing the other any good at all." "[MASK], no... !"
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Teray	"[MASK]..." He looked at her angrily. "We can't afford this. Only people safe and secure in Houses can afford to let their emotions get in the way of their judgment." "Do you want to stay behind?" "Yes.
<name>Jedao</name>	Jedao	Teray	Then he stood back in triumph and watched while his opponent died. [MASK] opened his eyes and stared at the small figurine in his hands. He could see its beauty, its perfection, even more clearly now. What was it the Clayarks called themselves?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Coransee	But he had never really believed she would. In spite of all [MASK]'s power and apparent attractiveness to women, he had never let himself believe it. She touched his arm and he savored her touch for a moment, then moved his arm away.
<name>Healer</name>	Healer	Amber	She probably could with her healer's propensity for poking around inside and outside of things. Fine. A moment later, as they rounded a bend, they came within sight of the mins [MASK] had spotted. These were just the shells of a cluster of buildings.
<name>Prince of Amber</name>	Prince of Amber	Pattemmaster	Brother, I have to know that when you're older and more experienced you won't decide that you gave up the Pattern too easily. I have to be certain that you'll be content as a Housemaster and not decide to try for [MASK]."
<name>Dany</name> (referring to Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones)	Dany (referring to Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones)	Iray	" "And what about me, My Lord?" If there had been any of [MASK]'s childishness left, it was gone now. "Will it also be 'not as bad as I think' with my husband forbidden to me, and his slaver my owner!"
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Coransee	[MASK] had chosen himself. But he said... That's right. He said. Of course, he could have succeeded me. No doubt he would have if you hadn't killed him. But you didn't want him to? He wasn't good enough, young one.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Kai	He had the idea that women from outside the school were better. He tried to attract them—and usually failed. But until I met [MASK], he had never lost one of his student girlfriends to one of them. It was too much."
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Coransee	"I could look into the boy's thoughts for verification, but I would rather not have to." [MASK] shrugged, almost lazily. "If you expect me to confirm all that, you're going to have to. It's true up to a point, of course.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Teray	"If you had come up and found me fighting for my life, you would have finished me off." "As you would have finished me in the same situation, brother," said [MASK] softly. "I learn from you.
<name>Ruby</name>	Ruby	Suliana	It might be easier if he had more to do. His mutes still seemed too efficient. Except for an occasional healing, they did not need him. Or so he thought until a small red-haired mute woman named [MASK] collapsed at his door one night.
<name>Corwin</name>	Corwin	Teray	[MASK], seemingly bodiless, only a point of light himself in this mental universe, discovered that he could change his point of view without seeming to move. He was suddenly able to see the members of the Pattern not as starlike points of light but as luminescent threads.
<name>He</name>	He	NowTeray	The anger flared for a moment. "Are you all right?" She did not answer. "Is the child all right?" "We're both all right... for now. I have to go back to him tonight." [MASK] felt anger of his own.
<name>Alai</name>	Alai	Jason	Now he knew that alongside some others, [MASK] could qualify as the House humanitarian. No one actually killed mutes, but certain of the outsiders and women made a grotesque game of coming as close to killing them as they could.
<name>Master</name>	Master	Coransee	There's a way out." He broke off, staring at her. "What?" "Listen. [MASK] said you were to report to him tomorrow... tomorrow morning. He said he might make you his apprentice. You're stronger than he thought.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Teray	A fraction later, he knew what it was, and used his new knowledge with fear-inspired accuracy. Without understanding quite how he knew, [MASK] realized that he had just avoided—or at least postponed—a cerebral hemorrhage.
<name>the scar</name>	the scar	Joachim	"So close inside the sector?" "And the most powerful one of us." The man with [MASK] spoke for the first time. "The raiders killed two of his outsiders and kidnaped a mute."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Leal	well they were more after vengeance than justice. The lead wife of the man I killed was there to goad them on. [MASK] was there telling as little of the truth as he could because he knew he was really to blame for the man's death.
<name>Azkaban</name>	Azkaban	Darah	A little of their urgency was gone, though. They reassured each other, calmed each other, without intending to. They had hardly spoken since escaping from [MASK]—had hardly communicated in any way beyond sensing each other's feelings. That had been enough until now.
<name>Corwin</name>	Corwin	Teray	"But you'd hold the Pattern by then. You could stop me from any attempt to usurp..." "Perhaps 1 could—and perhaps not. But I'm not about to wait and find out tne hard way." [MASK] knew the price now.
<name>Neo</name>	Neo	Teray	The group was slightly larger than the one they had met earlier. But [MASK] handled it in a fraction of the time he had needed to handle the first group. He handled it using less energy, since he was not required to puncture or tear anything.
<name>he</name>	he	Teray	Somehow, [MASK] held on to his temper. "You've made your point," he said quietly. "Now drop it." "Why?" Her voice was dryly mocking. "Are you ashamed? Good.
