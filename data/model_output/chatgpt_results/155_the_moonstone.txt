<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Profit	[MASK], good friends, I beseech you, by my example. It will save you from many troubles of the vexing sort. Cultivate a superiority to reason, and see how you pare the claws of all the sensible people when they try to scratch you for your own good!
<name>Isaac Watts</name>	Isaac Watts	Satan	When they were not riding, or seeing company, or taking their meals, or piping their songs, there they were with their heads together, as busy as bees, spoiling the door. Who was the poet who said that [MASK] finds some mischief still for idle hands to do?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Rachel	My lady saw there was no reasoning with her that night. “Come into my room, [MASK], the first thing to-morrow morning,” she said. “I shall have something to say to you.”
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rosanna	“Betteredge!” cries the voice, “where are you?” “Here!” I shouted out in return, without a notion in my mind of who it was. [MASK] started to her feet, and stood looking towards the voice.
<name>He</name>	He	Betteredge	he inquired, addressing himself to me. “I am quite at your service,” I answered. [MASK] took a chair and seated himself at the table. He produced a huge old-fashioned leather pocket-book, with a pencil of dimensions to match.
<name>Hyde</name>	Hyde	Betteredge	The poor wretch was evidently no favourite in the house. Out of the house, I had [MASK]’s word for it that he was unpopular everywhere. “What a life!” I thought to myself, as we descended the doctor’s doorsteps.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rachel	After what has passed here to-day, between us two, the dead-lock, in this case, is complete. [MASK]’s own innocence is (as her mother knows, and as I know) beyond a doubt.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Penelope	“Are you out of your mind?” I asked her. “Gone!” says [MASK]. “Gone, nobody knows how! Come up and see.” She dragged me after her into our young lady’s sitting-room, which opened into her bedroom.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Penelope	and I am too fond of her to hear it, and keep my temper. Leave me by myself.” I left him, miserable enough, leaning on the sill of my window, with his face hidden in his hands and [MASK] peeping through the door, longing to comfort him.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Rachel	But do try to get over the habit of paying compliments--do, to please me.” “I never paid you a compliment, [MASK], in my life. Successful love may sometimes use the language of flattery, I admit.
<name>his own brother</name>	his own brother	Rachel	I never remember feeling the presence of the lawyer to be more unwelcome than I felt it at that moment. He looked ready for anything in the way of an obstructive proceeding--capable even of keeping the peace with [MASK] for one of the combatants!
<name>her</name>	her	Rachel	I said I would wait in the library, on the chance of seeing her. In the fervour of my zeal to distribute the letters, it never occurred to me to inquire about [MASK]. The house was quiet, and it was past the hour at which the musical performance began.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Ella”--was	A woman’s name, as I suppose--the name of “[MASK] often on his lips at this time. A few minutes before the end he asked me to lift him on his pillow, to see the sun rise through the window. He was very weak.
<name>John</name>	John	Penelope	[MASK] mentioned his request through the door. The answer reached us by the same road: “I have nothing to tell the policeman--I can’t see anybody.” Our experienced officer looked equally surprised and offended when he heard that reply.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Samuel	When all the doors were made fast, except the side door that opened on the terrace, I sent [MASK] to bed, and stepped out for a breath of fresh air before I too went to bed in my turn.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Betteredge	This stroke of sarcasm put him in a better humour with himself and with me. We left the house, and passed through the lodge gates. Once clear of the grounds, the duties of hospitality (in [MASK]’s code of morals) ceased, and the privileges of curiosity began.
<name>do you?</name>	do you?	Betteredge	THEY can’t help themselves, you know. THEY must put up with the man with the piebald hair, and the gipsy complexion--or they would get no doctoring at all.” “You don’t seem to like him, [MASK]?”
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Samuel	At that moment, the carriage appeared in the distance, through the gap, on its way to the lodge-gate. There was another man, besides [MASK], plainly visible in the rumble behind. “All right!” said the Sergeant to himself.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachel	I approach [MASK] with the feeling of a criminal who is going to receive his sentence. When I find that she has changed her mind too--when I hear her propose to break the engagement--I experience (there is no sort of doubt about it) a most overpowering sense of relief.
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Rosanna	I was ready enough, in the girl’s own interest, to have a little talk with [MASK] in private. But the needful opportunity failed to present itself. She only came downstairs again at tea-time. When she did appear, she was flighty and excited, had what
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Betteredge	But what brings you now, sir?” “The Moonstone again, [MASK].” The old man suddenly stood still, and looked at me in the grey twilight as if he suspected his own ears of deceiving him.
<name>friend</name>	friend	Betteredge	“And I don’t want to leave her without what may be a needful warning. If you were in my place, [MASK], tell me, in one word, what would you do?” In one word, I told him: “Wait.”
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rosanna	But I was resolved to see for myself what new mystification was going on before I trusted [MASK]’s boot in the Sergeant’s hands. My old notion of screening the girl, if I could, seemed to have come back on me again, at the eleventh hour.
<name>Miss Bart</name>	Miss Bart	Rachel	[MASK] accompanied her. “I wish I could drag the chair,” she broke out, recklessly. “I wish I could fatigue myself till I was ready to drop.” She was in the same humour in the evening.
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Penelope	The clock had struck eight, and I was just going out to chain up the dogs again, when I heard a sudden whisking of petticoats on the stairs behind me. I turned about, and there was [MASK] flying down after me like mad.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Betteredge	Searching for something else in one of the pockets, I came upon a crumpled piece of paper, and, taking it out, found [MASK]’s forgotten letter in my hand. It seemed hard on my good old friend to leave him without a reply.
<name>The sailor</name>	The sailor	Gooseberry	Nothing happened; and nothing more was to be heard, or seen, of the sailor. [MASK] decided on going back to the office. Just as he came to this conclusion, who should appear, on the opposite side of the street as usual, but the mechanic again!
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Rosanna	Not feeling myself able to comfort her, there was only one other thing to do. That thing was--to take her in to dinner. “Help me up,” I said. “You’re late for dinner, [MASK]--and I have come to fetch you in.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Betteredge	“Not the least in the world.” [MASK] stared hard at me, in dead silence. He closed the book with great deliberation; he locked it up again in the cupboard with extraordinary care; he wheeled round, and stared hard at me once more.
<name>Eeyore</name>	Eeyore	Rosanna	but as if she had been looking at something too long. Possibly, it was a misty something raised by her own thoughts. There was certainly no object about her to look at which she had not seen already hundreds on hundreds of times. “Cheer up, [MASK]!”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Sir,--They	That was all he ever wrote, and that came regularly to the day; until some six or eight months since, when the form of the letter varied for the first time. It ran now: ‘[MASK] tell me I am dying.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Rachel	This is not a matter in which any stranger can help us. He adds to what I have to suffer; and he maddens [MASK] if she only hears his name. “My plans for the future are as well settled as they can be.
<name>horses</name>	horses	Rachel	“Some people are born boasters, and they never get over it to their dying day. I’m one of them.” There was only one way to take with him. I appealed to his interest in [MASK], and his interest in me.
<name>Uriah Heep</name>	Uriah Heep	Betteredge	I’m determined not to be behind ‘em, or before ‘em, by so much as a hair’s breadth. I’m a blind agent--that’s what I am. A blind agent!” repeated [MASK], with infinite relish of his own description of himself.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rosanna	Having reached his subject in this fashion, he described himself as making his inquiries about the lost Diamond, partly with a view to find it, and partly for the purpose of clearing [MASK] from the unjust suspicions of her enemies in the house.
<name>Dead Man's</name>	Dead Man's	Cobb	“Consequently, she must have been walking towards this place. Is [MASK]’s Hole on the other side of that point of land there? And can we get to it--now it’s low water--by the beach?”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Rosanna	Seeing no possible injury to [MASK] if I owned the truth, I answered that the girl had come to us rather sparely provided with linen, and that my lady, in recompense for her good conduct (I laid a stress on her good conduct), had given her a new outfit not a fortnight since.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Rachel	[MASK]!” I burst out. “Haven’t you seen yet, that my heart yearns to make a Christian of you? Has no inner voice told you that I am trying to do for you, what I was trying to do for your dear mother when death snatched her out of my hands?”
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Gooseberry	There he stopped before a public-house, under the sign of ‘The Wheel of Fortune,’ and, after examining the place outside, went in. [MASK] went in too. There were a great many people, mostly of the decent sort, at the bar.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Rachel	In the state of my feelings at that moment, I do sincerely believe that she had hit on the only possible way of forcing me to leave the room. By the mere worldly mind my position towards [MASK] might have been viewed as presenting difficulties of no ordinary kind.
<name>Cecily</name>	Cecily	Rachel	We agreed that we were to be cousins, and nothing more.” “I break the agreement, [MASK], every time I see you.” “Then don’t see me.” “Quite useless! I break the agreement every time I think of you.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Penelope	I never went back to my bed. Nothing happened until [MASK] came in, at the usual time in the morning.” I dropped her hand, and rose, and took a turn in the room. Every question that I could put had been answered.
<name>Mr.</name>	Mr.	Mr.	Their calculations were all thrown out, of course, by what happened in the house on Wednesday night; and they have no more to do with the actual loss of the jewel than you have. But I can tell you one thing, [MASK] Betteredge--if WE don’t find the Moonstone, THEY will.
<name>Lorna</name>	Lorna	Rosanna	Having now told the story of [MASK], I have only to notice one of the many queer ways of this strange girl to get on next to the story of the sands. Our house is high up on the Yorkshire coast, and close by the sea.
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	Gooseberry	The moment afterwards, I felt a soft pull at my coat-tails, and a small voice whispered, “Look here, sir!” [MASK] had followed us into the room. His loose eyes rolled frightfully--not in terror, but in exultation.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Betteredge	“She has just passed me, sir, with a very disturbed face, and in a very odd manner.” “I am afraid I am innocently the cause of that disturbance, [MASK].” “You, sir!”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Betteredge	And I must trust to you, at starting.” It is likely enough that I spoke rather carelessly. At any rate, [MASK] seemed to be piqued by something in the reply which I had just made to him.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Rosanna	I despatched the first woman-servant I could find to [MASK]’s room; and I sent the boy back to say that I myself would follow him with the boot. This, I am well aware, was not the quickest way to take of obeying the directions which I had received.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Betteredge	I know you can do that. Can you do no more?” “What more can you expect from me, sir?” asked [MASK], with an appearance of the utmost humility. “I expect more--from what you said just now.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Clack	She kissed her mother on the forehead, and looked my way. “Good-bye, [MASK],” she said, carelessly. Her insolence roused no angry feeling in me; I only made a private memorandum to pray for her.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Sergeant	“May I make so bold, [MASK], as to tell the women a third thing?” I asked. “Are they free (with your compliments) to fidget up and downstairs, and whisk in and out of their bed-rooms, if the fit takes them?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Betteredge	You’re miles away still from getting at the truth. Walk in your sleep? You never did such a thing in your life!” Here again, I felt that [MASK] must be right. Neither at home nor abroad had my life ever been of the solitary sort.
<name>Sir Percival</name>	Sir Percival	Lord	[MASK]! how the wind howled, and how the rain drove at the window, as I sat there waiting for one or other of them to speak again! “Be so good as to express yourself plainly,” said my lady. “Do you refer to my daughter?”
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Rosanna	My reliance on the tea-pot, as an ally, did not go unrewarded. In less than half an hour I knew as much as the Sergeant himself. My lady’s maid and the housemaid, had, it appeared, neither of them believed in [MASK]’s illness of the previous day.
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Rachel	“In plain English,” he said, “my house is to be turned into a trap to catch [MASK]; with a bait to tempt her, in the shape of an invitation from my wife and daughters.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rachel	From the moment when I knew that the evidence on which I stood condemned in [MASK]’s mind, was the evidence of her own eyes, nothing--not even my conviction of my own innocence--was clear to my mind.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name that fits in this context)	her (There is no proper name that fits in this context)	Rosanna	If I could only have got her away before she heard those dreadful words----” “There! there!” I said, “don’t lose your head. I can’t call to mind that anything happened to alarm [MASK].” “Nothing to alarm her, father.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rachel	“On what point?” “You shall hear. I admit that the mark of the name proves the nightgown to be yours. I admit that the mark of the paint proves the nightgown to have made the smear on [MASK]’s door.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rachel	“Colonel Herncastle knew my lady well enough to know that she would have refused to accept any legacy that came to her from HIM.” “How did he know that [MASK] might not refuse to accept it, too?”
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Gabriel	“But I can’t prevail on myself to see him alone. Bring him in, [MASK], and stay here as long as he stays.” This was the first attack of the megrims that I remembered in my mistress since the time when she was a young girl.
<name>me</name>	me	Rachel	She was so good as to feel great regret and much surprise, entirely on my account. She was at the same time, however, not in a position to offer me any explanation, or to press [MASK] on a matter which appeared to relate to a question of private feeling alone.
<name>my dear fellow</name>	my dear fellow	Betteredge	“Why not look into it?” he said, as if I had personally objected to looking into it. “Why the devil lose your patience, [MASK], when patience is all that’s wanted to arrive at the truth? Don’t interrupt me.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Rachel	“Then don’t see me.” “Quite useless! I break the agreement every time I think of you. Oh, [MASK]! how kindly you told me, only the other day, that my place in your estimation was a higher place than it had ever been yet!
<name>David</name>	David	Gooseberry	“And you ran out after him--eh?” “Yes, sir.” “[MASK],” said the Sergeant, patting his head, “you have got something in that small skull of yours--and it isn’t cotton-wool.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Godfrey	“Would you think, to look at me,” she went on, “that I am the wretchedest girl living? It’s true, [MASK]. What greater wretchedness can there be than to live degraded in your own estimation? That is my life now.”
<name>Mr. Lorry</name>	Mr. Lorry	Gooseberry	The moment he turned the corner of the street, he recovered his balance instantly, and became as sober a member of society as you could wish to see. [MASK] went back to ‘The Wheel of Fortune’ in a very bewildered state of mind.
<name>her</name>	her	Rachel	They suddenly changed him from a man in a state of red-hot anger to a man in a state of icy-cold contempt. It was plain to everybody that [MASK] had said something--short and plain as her answer had been--which gave him the upper hand of her at last.
<name>He</name>	He	Lord	I picture to myself a member of the family reading these pages fifty years hence. [MASK]! what a compliment he will feel it, to be asked to take nothing on hear-say, and to be treated in all respects like a Judge on the bench.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Samuel	My daughter knew, as she has already told you. She or [MASK] may have mentioned the thing to the other servants--or the other servants may have heard the talk for themselves, through the side-door of the hall, which might have been open to the back staircase.
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Penelope	It was three o’clock before they took off their aprons, and released [MASK] (much the worse for the vehicle), and cleaned themselves of their mess. But they had done what they wanted--they had finished the door on the birthday, and proud enough they were of it.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Rachel	I pleaded. “I can’t part with you, [MASK]--I can’t part with you!” I tried to fold her in my arms. But she drew back. My fervour did not communicate itself; it only alarmed her.
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Betteredge	But the second--the memorandum--produced a strong impression on him. “The Sergeant said it!” cried [MASK]. “From first to last, sir, the Sergeant said she had got a memorandum of the hiding-place. And here it is!
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Rachel	“One question, [MASK]. Have you any personal objection to me?” “I! I always liked you. After what you have just said to me, I should be insensible indeed if I didn’t respect and admire you as well.”
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Query	There isn’t the shadow of a reason why she should have hidden it--and yet she must have hidden it. [MASK],” says the Sergeant, walking on again, “is the paint-stained dress a petticoat or a night-gown?
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Herncastle	The provost-marshal was in attendance, to prove that the General was in earnest; and in the throng that followed the proclamation, [MASK] and I met again. He held out his hand, as usual, and said, “Good morning.”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Godfrey	“I am tired of the subject.” “You are tired of the subject? My dear [MASK], I am going to make a remark.” “What is it?” “You live a great deal too much in the society of women.
<name>Christine</name>	Christine	Rachel	Cross the small drawing-room, and open the door in front of you which leads into the music-room. There, you will find [MASK]--and find her, alone.” “How can I thank you!” “I will tell you how.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Nancy	The only thing she wished to be sure of was that the man would do what she told him. The man had promised to do it, and had driven away. [MASK] had been called back to her work in the kitchen.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Drusilla	I peeped in; and the holy inner voice that never deceives, whispered to me, “You have met her, [MASK], everywhere else; meet her at the bath, and the work is done.” I observed a dressing-gown thrown across a chair.
<name>her</name>	her	Rachel	He maintained the same appearance of ease, and talked the same godless gossip, hour after hour, until it was time to take leave. As he shook hands with [MASK], I caught his hard and cunning eyes resting on her for a moment with a peculiar interest and attention.
<name>Mr. Murray</name>	Mr. Murray	Betteredge	He left off picking at his fingers, and suddenly brightened up. “Yes! yes! yes!” he exclaimed eagerly. “That’s it! I sent you a message!” “And [MASK] duly communicated it by letter,” I went on.
<name>she</name>	she	Rosanna	His experience in such matters told him that [MASK] was in all probability carrying about her a memorandum of the hiding-place, to guide her, in case she returned to it, under changed circumstances and after a lapse of time.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Penelope	The person with the cap-ribbons appeared. “[MASK]! my bath.” Let me give her her due. In the state of my feelings at that moment, I do sincerely believe that she had hit on the only possible way of forcing me to leave the room.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Drusilla	“[MASK], I have been in the habit of speaking very foolishly and very rudely to you, on former occasions. I beg your pardon. I hope you will forgive me.” My face, I suppose, betrayed the astonishment I felt at this.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Heaven	If this guess was right, why--having lost her Diamond--should she object to the presence in the house of the very people whose business it was to recover it for her? And how, in [MASK]’s name, could SHE know that the Moonstone would never be found again?
<name>the witness</name>	the witness	Gooseberry	The Sergeant’s digressions irritated me. He saw it; and confined himself more strictly to [MASK]’s evidence when he went on. “The sailor,” he resumed, “asked if he could have a bed. The landlord said ‘No; they were full.’
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Betteredge	Having put on his spectacles, he opened the pocket-book, at a blank page, and addressed himself to me once more. “I have lived,” said [MASK], looking at me sternly, “nigh on fifty years in the service of my late lady.
<name>London</name>	London	Frizinghall	She had pretended to be ill, and had gone secretly to [MASK]. She had been up all night, making something or destroying something, in private. And she had been at the Shivering Sand, that evening, under circumstances which were highly suspicious, to say the least of them.
<name>Miss Mills</name>	Miss Mills	Rachel	“I hope, [MASK], I take up the cause of all oppressed people rather warmly,” he said. The tone in which those words were spoken might have melted a stone. But, oh dear, what is the hardness of stone?
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	mamma”--and	She said, “Try to forgive me, [MASK] then pulled down her veil over her face so vehemently that she tore it. In another moment she had run down the steps, and had rushed into the carriage as if it was a hiding-place.
<name>the magistrate</name>	the magistrate	Rachel	Take me to the magistrate, and I will swear it!” My aunt caught me by the hand, and whispered, “Stand between us for a minute or two. Don’t let [MASK] see me.” I noticed a bluish tinge in her face which alarmed me.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Rachel	Some persons, hearing what I now heard, would have been probably overwhelmed with astonishment. For my own part, knowing [MASK]’s spirit to have been essentially unregenerate from her childhood upwards, I was prepared for whatever my aunt could tell me on the subject of her daughter.
<name>Mr. Abney</name>	Mr. Abney	Betteredge	I passed on to the second question. “Before I was sent abroad, [MASK], you saw a great deal of me when I was a boy? Now tell me plainly, do you remember anything strange of me, after I had gone to bed at night?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Rachel	[MASK] shall be asked to spend the day here; and you shall receive due notice of it.” “When? To-morrow?” “To-morrow won’t give us time enough to get her answer. Say the day after.”
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Nancy	and I’ll fetch her in.” [MASK] (who has a fine appetite) looked pleased. When she looks pleased, she looks nice. When she looks nice, I chuck her under the chin. It isn’t immorality--it’s only habit.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Penelope	I never was more nearly strangled in my life. “I saw him take her away alone into the rose-garden,” says [MASK]. “And I waited behind the holly to see how they came back. They had gone out arm-in-arm, both laughing.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Godfrey	“You are a very good fellow in your way, [MASK],” she said--not taking the smallest notice, observe, of me, and still speaking to her cousin as if she was one young man addressing another.
<name>Captain Smollett</name>	Captain Smollett	Rosanna	The tide was on the turn, and the horrid sand began to shiver. The broad brown face of it heaved slowly, and then dimpled and quivered all over. “Do you know what it looks like to ME?” says [MASK], catching me by the shoulder again.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Rachel	or, later again, when I put the Moonstone into [MASK]’s hands? or, later still, when the company came, and we all assembled round the dinner-table? My memory disposed of that string of questions readily enough, until I came to the last.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Rachel	I bid you heartily welcome!” said the poor old fellow, fighting manfully against the gloom of the deserted house, and receiving me with the sociable and courteous attention of the bygone time. It vexed me to disappoint him. But the house was [MASK]’s house, now.
