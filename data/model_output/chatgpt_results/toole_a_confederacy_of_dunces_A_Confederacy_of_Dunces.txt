<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Ignatius	Just look at him.” “Are you two deviates talking about me?” [MASK] asked angrily. “If you’re going to get this excited about a door, I seriously doubt whether you’ll survive for long in the vicious arena of politics.”
<name>he</name>	he	Ignatius	The police tried to arress him.” “Oh, my dear. Policemen are always so adamant, aren’t they?” ‘Yeah, and [MASK] got him a master’s degree and all.” “What in the world was he doing?’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Darlene	No wonder business stinks. I can’t stand dykes. I can’t!” “The only people we get in here at night anymore is plainclothesmen,” [MASK] said. “How come they don’t get a plainclothesman after women like that?”
<name>Sam Spade</name>	Sam Spade	Lana	[MASK] pushed the door open and hollered out into the street, “Hey, you. Get off my curb, you character.” “Please,” a rich voice answered from the street, pausing to think of some excuse. “I am only resting my rather broken feet.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jones	If I gonna be a doorman, I gonna be the mos sabotagin doorman ever guarded a plantation. Ooo-wee. The cotton fiel be bum to the groun before I’m through.” “Watch out, [MASK]. Don be gettin yourself in no trouble.”
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Ignatius	[MASK] thundered. “Am I going to be thrown out again into the abyss? Apparently you have bowled all the charity out of your soul. I must have at least a week in bed, with service, before I shall again be whole.”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Abelman	It doesn’t matter to you that [MASK] is about to sue our lives away if he can.” The aquamarine lids trembled. “Aren’t you going to get the idealist?” “Some other time. I’ve had enough for one day.”
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Dorian	“Oh, hit him again,” [MASK] chirped happily. “What fun!” “Please let me out of these awful chains,” the sailor pleaded. “My sailor suit’s getting all rusty.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ignatius	Are you committed enough to help in this bold and crucial movement? “Oh, my God!” [MASK] spurted through his dripping moustache. “Are they letting her speak in public now? What in the world does the title of this ludicrous lecture mean?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Reilly	If [MASK] would confess to writing the letter, if somehow he could come out of this all right, he would change. He would vow to become a new person. He might even give the company a little supervision. It was only sensible and practical to supervise that place.
<name>The Pirate</name>	The Pirate	Ignatius	“Hot dogs, ladies?” [MASK] asked pleasantly. The ladies’ eyes studied the sign, the earring, the scarf, the cutlass, and pleaded for him to move along. Rain for their hanging would have been bad enough. But this.
<name>him</name>	him	Mancuso	He didn’t want to be responsible for a death. It would be better to give [MASK] a probationary period and kick him off the force. “Okay. Don’t go back to the bus station. Get out on the streets again and get some sunshine.
<name>The policeman</name>	The policeman	Darlene	A policeman was a policeman. It was always best to ignore them unless they bothered you. “Where he came from?” [MASK] was asking the crowd. The rose cockatoo rested once again on her arm, the earring dangling from its beak like a golden worm.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Ignatius	“Oh, my door.” “Where are those agents?” [MASK] demanded, unpinning his cutlass and waving it about. “We must apprehend them before they leave this building.” “Please get me out. I can’t stand the dark.”
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Ignatius	“Good grief,” [MASK] gasped, feeling for the door. In his wake he had left a trail of overturned tables. “How dare you fiends inflict a rabid bird upon your unsuspecting customers? You may expect to be sued in the morning.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Timmy	Then he returned to his apartment to finish the job of cleaning up the litter left from the kickoff rally. It had been the most fabulous party of his career: at the height of it [MASK] had fallen from a chandelier and sprained his ankle.
<name>Ellison</name>	Ellison	Ignatius	“Please don’t drop that loose-leaf folder. It contains the Journal, a sociological fantasy on which I’ve been working. It is my most commercial effort. Wonderful film possibilities at the hands of a Walt Disney or a George Pal.” “[MASK].”
<name>Donald Trump</name>	Donald Trump	Gonzalez	“Where did you hear such slander? That is totally false. Some white supremacist, some upstate redneck, perhaps even [MASK] himself no doubt began that vile rumor. How dare you, sir. All of you must realize that our cause has many enemies.”
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Ignatius	[MASK] slobbered, changing the subject. ‘Tou’ll be dragged from one reeking motel to another. You’ll end up a suicide.” “I’ll get married if I want to, boy. You can’t stop me. Not now.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Ignatius	“Oh, my dear, what a wild gathering it could be.” “There is no time to be lost,” [MASK] said sternly. “The apocalypse is near at hand.” ‘We’ll have it next week at my place.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Ignatius	“That is exactly what I mean,” [MASK] replied, aiming a paper ball at the bowl of the milk glass chandelier. “All you did was paste them little slips in the books.” “Yes, but I had my own aesthetic about pasting those slips.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Ignatius	That was true even when I worked for the New Orleans Public Library.” “But, [MASK], that was the only time you worked since you got out of college, and you was only there for two weeks.”
<name>Saul</name>	Saul	Crippled	I can just see that lawyer he’s got. [MASK] from chasing ambulances. Mutilated from being caught in fires he’s started for insurance money.” ‘"Well, you’ll take the bus back to the coast if you don’t hurry up.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lana	“But I ain’t making no money I’m so afraid the guy on the next stool is the police. You know what we need in here to make money?’ “What?” [MASK] asked angrily. ‘What we need in here is a animal.”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ignatius	He couldn’t permit this opportunity to slip through his swollen fingers. “I’ll put on some clogs. I’m in my Ruby Keeler phase,” the young man told [MASK] gaily. Then he began to sing, ‘“You go home and get your scanties.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Dorian	Without them, [MASK] felt that he and his building were completely unprotected. He took special care to lock his wrought-iron gate securely. Then he returned to his apartment to finish the job of cleaning up the litter left from the kickoff rally.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Santa	“Me, too. Listen, [MASK], why you called, sugar?” “Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. You remember when we was out bowling the other night?” “Tuesday?” “No, it was Wednesday, I think.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Ignatius	The few old male patrons moved out of the way of [MASK], who was floundering around among the tittle tables making moose calls and beating at the mass of rose feathers welded to his ear and shoulder. “How in the hell did that character get in here?”
<name>Uncle Earl</name>	Uncle Earl	Dorian	I own the building.” “I should have known. May I ask where the money comes from to support this decadent whimsy of yours?” “From my dear family out there in the wheat,” [MASK] sighed. ‘They send me large checks every month.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ignatius	“Of course I’m her child,” [MASK] said. “Can’t you see her affection for me?” “She loves her boy,” the old man said. “What you trying to do my poor child?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Ignatius	I will probably be turned into an utter mockery.” “I’m gonna iron you a nice white shirt and you gonna put on one of your poppa’s nice ties.” “Do I believe what I am hearing?” [MASK] asked his pillow.
<name>Juana</name>	Juana	Santa	It ain’t your fault you got a brat on your hands,” [MASK] grunted. “What you need is a man in that house, girl, to set that boy straight. I’m gonna find that nice old man ast about you.”
<name>Bob Dylan</name>	Bob Dylan	Ignatius	Again I have been awakened to the fact that my body appeals to some people more than my mind. “Ho hum,” [MASK] sighed. Personally, I feel like exposing this phony “folksinger” who I guess is preying on some other dedicated young girl liberal at this moment.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Mancuso	“The biggest I ever saw in my whole life,” [MASK] said, stretching his arms as if he were describing a fishing catch. The sergeant’s eyes shone. “The first thing I spotted was this green hunting cap he was wearing.”
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Ignatius	“You wouldn’t be working in here, son. I mean as a vendor.” “What?” [MASK] bellowed. “Out in the rain and snow all day long?” “It don’t snow here.” “It has on rare occasions.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Ignatius	[MASK] shouted. “Now tell me what you and that debauched McCarthyite have been doing? You probably belong to some secret political cell. No wonder I’ve been bombarded with those witch-hunt pamphlets. No wonder I was trailed last night. Where is that Battaglia matchmaker?
<name>Hob</name>	Hob	Fortuna	Oh, [MASK], you capricious sprite!] Personally, I have found that a lack of food and comfort, rather than ennobling the spirit, creates only anxiety within the human psyche and channels all of one’s better impulses only toward the end of procuring something to eat.
<name>Oscar Wilde</name>	Oscar Wilde	Boethius	“Most fools don’t comprehend my worldview at all.” “I wouldn’t imagine so.” “I suspect that beneath your offensively and vulgarly effeminate fagade there maybe a soul of sorts. Have you read widely in [MASK]?” “Who?
<name>alcohol</name>	alcohol	WCTU	"He would only go out and spend it on more liquor,” one of the other women, a shriveled crone whose face bespoke [MASK] affiliation, advised her friends with nasal wisdom and an abundance of harsh r’s.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Irene	“First that boy wants a king, now he wants peace. I’m telling you, [MASK]. For your own good. That boy’s gotta be put away.” “He ain’t wearing no earring.
<name>coral</name>	coral	Ups	yi. While he was waiting for someone to answer the bell, he read the faded sticker on the crystal of the door, “A slip of the lip can sink a ship.” Below a wave held her finger to [MASK] that had turned tan.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Claude	When [MASK] and me went to get your clothes from that head nurse and she hands us over your wallet with almost thirty dollars in it, that was the last straw. All your craziness was bad enough, but keeping that money from your poor momma . ..”
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Ignatius	“Please leave,” the spokeswoman ordered. “I shall.” [MASK] grabbed the handle of his cart and pushed off. “You women should all be on your knees begging forgiveness for what I have seen here on this fence.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jones	“I don’t want a race riot in here. I got an investment to protect.” “You better tell your little ofay kid friend move along.” [MASK] blew some smoke on the two. “I ain takin no insult with this kinda job.”
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Ignatius	So I says to her, I says, ‘Hey, honey, you gonna catch your death of cold wearing that little cloth coat full of holes.’ And she says . . “Please!” [MASK] shouted furiously.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Ignatius	All that money down the drain.” [MASK] belched and opened a drawer to search for the stationery that he believed he still had; there he found the yo-yo that he had bought from the Filipino who had been selling them in the neighborhood a few months ago.
<name>Mamie</name>	Mamie	Darlene	I getting pretty tire of bein vagran or workin below the minimal wage. Get somebody else run your erran.” “Aw, knock it off and finish my floor. I’ll get [MASK] to go.” ‘That po gal.”
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Gonzalez	She needs personal help.” “You’ve already used her as a guinea pig for that correspondence course you took. Why not let her alone. Let [MASK] retire her.” “Do that and you’ll kill her. Then she’ll really feel unwanted.
<name>Methuselah</name>	Methuselah	Clyde	Realizing that my plastic weapon was hardly a match for a long fork wielded by a maddened Methuselah, realizing that I was seeing [MASK] at his worst, I tried to end our little duel. I called out pacifying words; I entreated; I finally surrendered.
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Darlene	I remember you said [MASK] and the bird was gonna bring in so much business I’d need a doorman. Well, I got a doorman. You.” “Hey! I ain comin around here at night below the minimal wage.”
<name>my brother</name>	my brother	Ignatius	And I says to him, ‘That’s right, son. Take care.’” “That’s good advice.” “I’m all the time giving [MASK] advice. You know? I’m always trying to help him out.”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Myma	His hands sympathized by sprouting a rich growth of tiny white bumps that itched maddeningly. What could he tell [MASK] about the movement for peace now? Now, like the abortive Crusade for Moorish Dignity, he had another debacle on his itching hands.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ignatius	But he returned with one of the smallest metal stools that [MASK] had ever seen. “Here. The person who used to work on the files used to wheel back and forth on this along the lower drawers. Try it.”
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Ignatius	[MASK] replied, ripping open his own shutters and looking out into the dark, cold alley. “Open up there. How dare you hide behind those shutters.” He ran furiously to the kitchen, filled a pot with water, and rushed back to his room.
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	George	You could tell by the way that he talked, though, that he had gone to school a long time. That was probably what was wrong with him. [MASK] had been wise enough to get out of school as soon as possible.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Ignatius	“Oh, my God!” [MASK] spluttered. “No wonder you are so lost.” “Here,” the old man said, opening a metal locker near the stove. “Put this on.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Frieda	The cutlass, the smock. Someone would be injured. I came here to speak, not dance. I don’t dance. I never dance. I have never danced in my life.” “Well, you’re going to dance now, “[MASK] told him.
<name>honey</name>	honey	Ignatius	“Ain’t that something. So, you know what I done, [MASK]. I give her a quarter and I says, ‘Here, darling, go buy you a trinket for your litde granchirren.’” “What?”
<name>Uncle Duke</name>	Uncle Duke	Ignatius	[MASK] snorted at the movie credits. All of the people involved in the film were equally unacceptable. A set designer, in particular, had appalled him too many times in the past. The heroine was even more offensive than she had been in the circus musical.
<name>Lina</name>	Lina	Lana	“Wait a minute,” [MASK] screamed in the best tradition of the director in a musical movie. She had always enjoyed the theatrical aspects of her profession: performing, posing, composing tableaux, directing acts. “That’s it.” “That’s what?”
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Ignatius	“I’m gonna put you down in the French Quarter.” ‘What?” [MASK] thundered. “Do you think that I am going to perambulate about in that sinkhole of vice? No, I am afraid that the Quarter is out of the question.
<name>Fate</name>	Fate	Fortuna	There on the worn stones of the Quarter I enlisted the aid of this wilted flower of a human in gathering his associates in foppery together behind a banner of brotherhood. Our first step will be to elect one of their number to some very high office—the presidency, if [MASK] spins us kindly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lana	I guess you’d like to become the manager of this club, huh?” “No, ma’am.” “Well, remember that,” [MASK] said and ran a finger along the ads. “Look at this.
<name>he</name>	he	Santa	“The one thing I can’t stand is a poor loser or a bad sport.” “If somebody does me dirt,” [MASK] continued, “I try to turn the other cheek. You know what I mean? That’s the Christian way.
<name>Ma Rainey</name>	Ma Rainey	Lana	“Put down that broom and get on that phonograph before I call up the precinct,” [MASK] hollered at him. “And you get off your stool and get on that phonograph before I call up the precinc and ax them po-lice mothers make a search for your orphan frien who disappear.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Ignatius	This photograph was far superior. A nude woman was sitting on the edge of a desk next to a globe of the world. The suggested onanism with the piece of chalk intrigued [MASK]. Her face was hidden behind a large book.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Ignatius	I suspect that we are teetering on the edge of the abyss.” “[MASK], I’m gonna have to go by the Homestead tomorrow.” “We shall not deal with those usurers, Mother.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Ignatius	“You mean somebody broke into this house just to take one of your dirty sheets?” “If you were a bit more conscientious about doing the laundry, the description of that sheet would be somewhat different.” “Okay, hand over that paper, [MASK].”
<name>Truman</name>	Truman	Ignatius	In many respects they’re wonderful tenants. They guard my building better than any watchdog could. They have loads of money that they get from some aging movie queen.” “Really?” [MASK] asked with interest. “Perhaps I was hasty about dropping them.
<name>He</name>	He	Ignatius	“Perhaps I shall get to the filing,” [MASK] said when he found himself staring out the window at only an empty street. “Will you please sign that correspondence so that I can file the carbon copies.
<name>Abbie</name>	Abbie	Dorian	“I can’t imagine how you decided to besmirch the movement by inviting those rowdies here.” “I had to,” [MASK] explained. “If you don’t invite them to a party, they break in anyway. Then they’re even worse.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Ignatius	You oughta get your ass down here. This the very fines ack I ever seen. Whoa!” “I can only imagine,” [MASK] said respectfully. Some brilliant satire on the decadent Old South being cast before the unaware swine in the Night of Joy audience.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Ignatius	“You see that? You’ve destroyed my initiative already,” [MASK] belched. “Well, I do hope that you have selected a scenic route, preferably something in a park area where there are ample seating accommodations for sufferers from tired, stunned feet.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Ignatius	‘The enemy is among us,” [MASK] said wildly. “Who tattled? Tell me. Someone is on to us.” “Oh, get me out of here,” the little sailor pleaded. “It’s awfully dark.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Clyde	It was then that a fight dawned in my intricate mind. I know that [MASK] was really trying to kill me. He would have the perfect excuse: self-defense. I had played right into his hands. Fortunately for me, I fell to the floor.
<name>Fate</name>	Fate	Fortuna	He lumbered over to the passageway where his cart was hidden, prepared a hot dog, and prayed that some customers would happen along before the day was over. Sadly he realized how low [MASK] had spun his wheel.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Ignatius	The neighbors would not see too much if they took [MASK] away during the night. She ran into the bathroom and powdered her face and the front of her dress, drew a surrealistic version of a mouth beneath her nose, and dashed into her bedroom to find a coat.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Irene	“Poor girl. Standing there in the rain and cold with her old sunbonnet on not knowing what nobody was saying half the time. It was hard in them days, [MASK]. Things was tough, kid.”
<name>Getz</name>	Getz	Gus	‘Well, there will be no Leon Levy Foundation.” “Do you resent it? There’s resentment in your voice. I can hear it. There’s hostility. [MASK], for your own sake. That doctor in the Medical Arts building.
<name>He</name>	He	Ignatius	Call me collect if you want to and we can talk over this problem of sexual orientation that you are having. You must have therapy soon or you will become a screaming queen. “How dare she?” [MASK] bellowed. Whatever happened to the Divine Right party?
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Ignatius	“Huh? What’s that, precious?” [MASK] extracted the pencil from his ear and opened the door. His mother’s maroon hair was fluffed high over her forehead; her cheekbones were red with rouge that had been spread nervously up to the eyeballs.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Ignatius	Like you’re having a nervous breakdown or something. Why the bandage? [MASK], what’s the matter? Look how much weight you’ve gained. I’ve just been reading these pitiful signs out here on the porch. Boy, have you had it.”
<name>David</name>	David	Ignatius	“Someone turn on that delicious record again.” “The challenge,” [MASK] continued at full volume, “is placed before you. Will you turn your singular talents to saving the world, or will you simply turn your backs on your fellow man?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ignatius	I cannot tolerate social injustice.” “Yes, you must go to the factory while your valve is operating,” the office manager said. [MASK] went behind the fifing cabinets, picked up the accumulated and unfiled material, and threw it in the wastebasket.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Angelo	“You said that?” “I admired your integrity, standing up for that boy in front of that dirty cop, especially if you got troubles with him at home. That takes courage.” “I wisht I woulda let [MASK] take him away.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ignatius	This strange medieval mind in its cloister.” “No doubt they were intrigued,” [MASK] murmured. Having found the bag, he was filling it with some socks he found lying on the floor. “Soon they’ll be able to see me in the flesh.”
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Reilly	How much worse the rumors would be if it were discovered that the note had been written by a hot dog vendor. [MASK] was the sort who would come to the campus with his wagon and try to sell hot dogs right before the Social Studies Building.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Ignatius	In a moment, he was crouched down against the side of the stage. Over his head, the Nazi proprietress was saying, “Welcome, ladies and genitals.” It was so dreadful a beginning that [MASK] almost knocked over the table.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Lana	Even when she’s got only about five people drinking in here she’s making a fortune. Water don’t cost nothing.” “Wha she go shoppin for? A whip?” “Don’t ask me. [MASK] never tells me nothing.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Darlene	“I’m just startin out in showbiz. I need a break.” “Shut up, stupid. You think you can get that bird to strip you?” “Yes, ma’m,” [MASK] said enthusiastically. “Suddenly it come to me.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Lana	She would have a captive porter whom she could work for almost nothing. It was beautiful. [MASK] felt good for the first time since she had come upon those two characters messing up her bar. “The pay is twenty dollars a week.” “Hey!
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Ignatius	It’s still light outside.” “My being is not without its Proustian elements,” [MASK] said from the bed, to which he had quickly returned. “Oh, my stomach.” “It smells terrible in here.” “Well, what do you expect?
<name>Myma</name>	Myma	Ignatius	[MASK]. I’m beat. I’ve been on the road since nine o’clock yesterday morning. As soon as I mailed you that letter about the Peace Party routine, I said to myself, ‘Myma. Listen. This guy needs more than just a letter.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Ignatius	“Here, put on this cap.” The man gave [MASK] a little rectangle of white paper. “I am certainly not wearing a paper cap. The one that I have is perfectly good and far more healthful.” “You can’t wear a hunting cap.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Mancuso	What ldnda people you know, [MASK]? Old ladies who go sit in strip joints all alone, aunts. You probly belong to a ladies’ sodality or something. Stand up straight.” The sergeant studied the miserable figure that was shaking with the aftereffects of a dangerous cough.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Ignatius	“I thought you was never coming outta there. What kinda appointment you had? You just went to see a movie.” “Please,” [MASK] sighed. “I’ve just been through trauma. Run along.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Ignatius	“I’ll call in the police.” “Oh, my God!” “Pay me! Pay me or I’ll get the law.” The old man picked up the long fork and deftly placed its two rotting tongs at [MASK]’ throat.
<name>Leo</name>	Leo	Leola	Basically, we had trouble with funds. I could not milk another drachma out of my father, so [MASK], the Harlem find, got very hostile about salary (or lack of it) and finally dropped a remark or two that sounded a little anti-Semitic to me.
<name>Gypsy</name>	Gypsy	Darlene	[MASK] took off her pea jacket and showed the manager the tiny rings attached to the side of her slacks and blouse with safety pins. “You see these things? That’s what’s gonna make the act smooth. I been practicing with it in my apartment.
<name>Don Corleone</name>	Don Corleone	Ignatius	I hope that you have been selfless enough to secure the services of a specialist. And a priest. Have one come. I’ll see whether he’s acceptable.” [MASK] sprayed a little nervous saliva on the sheet that snowcapped the peak of his stomach.
