<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Michael	And in the vision the woman had said, converging upon this very moment in time, in this house, in this crucial moment when . . . “[MASK]? You want to do it?” Through a veil, he saw her face had lighted up like the face of a child.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Charlotte	And I described to her the full apparition, and I confessed his strange words. “Now, what can that mean, my pretty? You think he has no will of his own? You are a fool, [MASK]. Lie with him instead of me!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Stella	That he could see and talk to spirits. I was always shocked that a grown woman would believe things like that! But she became completely convinced of some sort of Satanic plot. I think [MASK] caused all that, inadvertently. I was too young then to really know.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Rowan	I didn’t have the knowledge then to imagine it any more perfectly than that, but it was the same process, the same thing.” “But they could have been natural deaths. [MASK].” She shook her head.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Stefan	[MASK], you were right in all your warnings and presentiments. I am sunk now deeper and deeper into this evil; I am beyond redemption. I should have come home to you. For the second time in my life I know the bitterness of regret.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Petyr	I want my soul to be in harmony with other souls. And this sin has made of me a monster in my eyes.” “And so what, then, [MASK]?” “I don’t know,” I said. “I don’t know.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Charlotte	Did [MASK] stay his hand? I cannot answer. I may never know. I reached my lodgings here less than an hour later, after meeting with the agent and speaking again to the innkeeper, as I related to you before.
<name>Rip</name>	Rip	Stuart	Telephones and automobiles—which had hardly existed in 1905 when he had ceased to be [MASK]—startled him endlessly. Electric lights filled him with insecurity. But the keenest source of agony was his own adult body. And the ever deepening realization that his childhood and adolescence were now gone without a trace.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Rowan	“I want to come now. I want to see my mother before she’s buried.” Damn the paper, and this unspeakable woman, whoever she was. “That’s scarcely appropriate,” said the woman wearily. “I insist,” said [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Rowan	Silence once again. “And of course he knew I couldn’t do it! He would have ripped the house apart to stop me had I tried.” [MASK] waited, until she could wait no longer, until the hate and anger in her were silently choking her.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Viola	And the sluggish breeze carried with it the scent of mold. His patient was well cared for, however. That he had to admit. A sweet old black nurse named [MASK] brought his patient out on the screened porch in the morning and took her in at evening.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Julien	All glanced awkwardly at the priest, who was horrified. [MASK] then gave the company a playful smile and a shrug, and then looking at his mother again, he became miserable, and knelt down beside the bed, and buried his face in the covers beside the dead woman.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Rowan	“[MASK], he would be unnatural. We need no more monsters. We ourselves are monstrous enough.” “He is as natural as we are,” she said. “This is what I’ve been trying to tell you.”
<name>Alizon</name>	Alizon	Charlotte	I asked gently. “And plainly [MASK] herself could not cure it. Maybe these women are not witches.” “Ah, but curing and cursing are two separate things,” said the vintner. ‘ ‘Would they had applied their talent merely to curing!
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Billy	Sudden gesture to the faded photograph on the bureau top. “The one who died in the War. I told him, ‘[MASK], you listen to me. Don’t you go near the May-fair women.’ She liked all the handsome young men.
<name>Deborah</name>	Deborah	Stefan	[MASK], if you do not recognize the Scottish witch’s daughter now from this account you do not remember the story. But I no longer held out the slightest doubt. “My Deborah,” I whispered in my heart. There was no chance that I could be wrong.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Antha	There had been no autopsy. When the undertaker became suspicious after examining the corpse and concluding that [MASK]’s facial scratches were not self-inflicted, he contacted the family doctor and was advised or told to let the matter drop.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rowan	At the hour of my mother’s death. I saw him as plainly as I see you, but it was only for a moment.” The woman looked down. [MASK] thought she had closed her eyes. Then she saw the little gleam of light beneath her lids.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Rowan	But had it all been planned, just to get him to that dangerous comer? Just to dazzle him and plant him motionless in the path of that careening car? The way he’d been planted in the path of [MASK]’s boat? Oh, so engulfing that fragment of memory.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Michael	[MASK] stood in the entranceway staring at the Christmas tree, with its lights burning brightly even in the light of the day. “Why did it have to begin so soon?” he whispered. “Why now, at this time of year?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cortland	“I told [MASK] about it all afterwards, when I thought an appropriate amount of time had passed. He wasn’t at all distressed. He listened to everything I said, and told me he was glad I’d told him.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Deborah	What I mean to do is consider the nature of the thing, that it neant to spare [MASK] pain in striking down her husband for her, without telling her the why of it, though it had to confess when it was asked.
<name>Alhazred</name>	Alhazred	Deirdre	“He will tell you it’s the other way around, ’ ’ said the old woman. “When he speaks into your ear so that no one can hear, he will say he is your slave, that he’s passed to you from [MASK].
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Hercules	No sooner had he eased down in the chair than the young ones began to appear to pay court to him as they had to her. [MASK], the Haitian servant, put the tumbler of bourbon in the old man’s hand.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Deborah	None of them. And [MASK] was just a body crumpled on the pyre. She wasn’t standing there with them. Now surely that means something in itself.” He reread what he had written. He wanted to add more but he was leery of embellishment.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Rowan	[MASK] said nothing further. However, the little girl in question was diagnosed within a week as having a rare form of bone cancer. She died before the end of the term. The principal has told the story over dinner countless times.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Deborah	“Are you speaking of escape, [MASK]?” I asked, for I had to admit that my imagination was at once inflamed. If only I could save her, cause a great confusion and then take her away by some means. But how could I do such a thing?
<name>Eichmann</name>	Eichmann	Llewellyn	This was long before our use of tape recorders, and I reconstructed the conversation as best I could as soon as I returned to my hotel, trying to capture [MASK]’s particular expressions. But it is a reconstruction. And throughout I have omitted my own persistent questions.
<name>Giuliano</name>	Giuliano	Roemer	I confessed all this to [MASK], who advised me that we had not taken vows of chastity but that I was behaving most honorably, which was as he expected, and that I should study my English books now, as my writing in English was still dreadful, and thereby occupy my mind.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Gander	On the other hand, if she was actually responsible for the deaths of six human beings! Well, I had to see her before I could make a decision. I had to see her. Unable to come to any decision, I invited [MASK] for a drink at the hotel.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Deborah	Perhaps a quarter of an hour, the very time the fiend had allotted for [MASK] to die on the pyre. From the shadows of the church foyer, I saw the square finally emptied, the very last climbing over the bodies that now blocked the side streets.
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Ellie	Though [MASK] was supposed to be telepathic, it was a parlor-game type of thing. She knew who it was when the phone rang. She could tell you what playing card you were holding in your hand.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Michael	“I think it was one of his tricks,” said [MASK]. “That was my feeling. The lily, that was some kind of trick. I think we should just go right on.” That’s what she wanted to hear, wasn’t it?
<name>Alayne</name>	Alayne	Rowan	It was a soft kiss against her ear. “When he was drowned, the visions. You made them!” “No, [MASK]. He was not here. I could not follow him to where he went. I am of the living only.”
<name>Nora</name>	Nora	Doctor”—he	You must have blamed yourself.” Her knee grazed his. Chills again. “What makes you think so?” “You can’t bear the thought of hurting anyone,” he said. “That’s naive.” “I may be crazy, [MASK]
<name>he</name>	he	Llewellyn	At some point during this conversation [MASK] realized that I had no prejudice whatsoever against him on account of his sexual preferences, indeed that nothing he was saying came as a shock to me, and this added to his relaxed attitude towards the story he told.
<name>Lucinda</name>	Lucinda	Deborah	But he knew my heart had been corrupted and won over by [MASK], just as surely as if she had bewitched me, but it was not bewitching, it was stronger even than that. “This woman is beyond our help now,” he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Michael	“What are you afraid of, really?” he asked. When she answered, she spoke in a whisper, so low that he could scarcely hear. “That I’m bad, [MASK], a bad person, a person who could really do harm.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Rowan	[MASK] appears to have transcended this sort of prejudice entirely. If there is any complaint against her among members of her profession it is that she is too quiet. She doesn’t talk enough about what she’s doing to the young doctors who must learn from her.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Deirdre	She was a very pretty woman. My wife was a good friend of hers. She loved [MASK], used to go to visit. My wife is right here with me. My wife is glad that you called.”
<name>He</name>	He	Pierce	“I’m not underestimating you. I only want to know what’s involved here. I cannot remain passive. It would be irresponsible to remain passive.” Moments of silence. [MASK] lifted his coffee cup and drank without a sound.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rowan	Come to me when he sleeps. Tonight, tomorrow, come when you will. There is no time for me. I am here when you say my name. But keep faith with me, [MASK]. Come alone to me, and in secret.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Ryan	But then I would have had to do it with a candle stick. “Yes, [MASK].” He settled down at the table, careful not to touch the dusty 713 surface with the sleeve of his perfectly tailored suit. The funeral suit.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Rowan	I have assumed all that. But [MASK], you see, it’s a matter of impression. I awoke with the impression that they were good, that I’d come back with the confirmation of their goodness, and that the purpose was something I’d agreed to do.
<name>Alvaro</name>	Alvaro	Charlotte	And they beat on the doors and said, ‘[MASK], come out.’ I had not seen him or known him until that moment. My mother had said: ‘Put on the emerald necklace, and by its light he will find you.’
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Rita	“It’s so peaceful here.” Peaceful! Alone at night, [MASK] cried and cried. She could hear the jukebox of the Negro bar across the street, the music rising over the brick walls and all the way up to the fourth-story attic.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Lightner	“Yes,” [MASK] had said, “the best research on the subject has been done by doctors—by cardiologists.” “Wasn’t there a film a few years back,” the doctor had asked, “about a woman who returned with the power to heal?
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Michael	“No. Coffee.” She closed her eyes. Who had he been, her dream lover? No face, no name. Only the sense of someone more delicate than [MASK], someone almost ethereal, or at least that was the word that came to her mind.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Lonigan	You don’t want to stay tonight in the house alone, do you? You tell me what you want to do. I can get someone to come here and stay with you.” With [MASK], his old friend, he fell right into stride.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Michael	[MASK] nodded, repeating the question silently, then he couldn’t take all this any longer. He set the card down on the table, careful not to brush the table itself with his fingertips. He was shaking slightly. He slipped his glove back on.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ryan	“No. I’m not scared. It’s the same beautiful house you left. [MASK] had a Christmas tree delivered. You ought to see it, it reaches the ceiling. It’s just waiting there in the parlor for you and me to decorate it.
<name>Woolf</name>	Woolf	Carlotta	And if [MASK] invites you up for tea, don’t go!” “About the ghost particularly ...” I said. (Throughout this interview, it was rarely necessary for me to complete a sentence.) “Oh, which one!
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carlotta	“What is it?” said [MASK]. “Only that I thought ...” She looked at the portrait, which was very skillfully done and showed a smiling black-eyed man, most certainly not alive, and buried beneath layers of brittle, crazed lacquer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Michael	[MASK] scrambled back onto his feet. “Look at you? I’ll kill you!” He flew at the creature, but it danced back into the pantry, arching its back and extending its hands as if to tease. It waltzed backwards through the kitchen door.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cortland	We parted ways at the comer as I helped her into her taxi. “If you do talk to [MASK],” she said, “don’t tell him you talked to me. He thinks I’m an awful gossip. But do ask him about that Texan.
<name>Cassandra</name>	Cassandra	Marguerite	[MASK] spent the last decades of her very long life reading all the time in the library full of “horrible and disgusting” things. She talked to herself out loud almost all the time. And would stand in front of mirrors and have very long conversations in English with her reflection.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Michael	She wanted to put him at ease again. His was a friendliness behind which there was not a single shadow of self-centeredness. She noted with pleasure as well that after each introduction, he presented the very same person to [MASK] with a simple, unexplained cordiality.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Aaron	It was a big bulky gray Lincoln Town Car, hardly his choice though the soft leather seat felt good, and the thing really cruised when he finally reached the interstate highway. Up until that point, [MASK] had been following in the limo.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Geertruid	And he spoke even to her about two of the women with us who were both powerful seers of spirits, and of [MASK], who could make the very glass rattle in the windows with her mind, if she chose. The child’s eyes grew large but her face was hard.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ryan	He went into the bathroom, filled a glass with water, and put the lily in it, and brought it back to the table. He didn’t remember about touching [MASK]’s hand until the dinner was long over and he was alone upstairs again, with his books.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Rowan	Remember those parties she used to give?” It amused [MASK] to listen to them talk, to hear their easy bursts of laughter. Never the slightest telepathic vibration of malice reached her. She could feel their good intentions now, their celebratory gaiety.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Michael	“Oh, I am telling you, nobody’s got a right to be as happy as I am now,” [MASK] said. “Nobody. Look at the trees,” he said opening his eyes, staring up at the black curling branches.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Ellie	She went out on the north deck and made sure the Sweet Christine was thoroughly secured, as she might be for the worst weather. Then she locked the wheelhouse and went back into the house. She set the various household alarm systems, which she had not used since [MASK] died.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Rowan	But what was so horrible about all this, how could this be worse than the autopsy table, except that this was . . . this was her mother. A woman stepped up behind the little girl, placing her hand on the girl’s shoulder. “[MASK]?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lasher	“And if it’s done. [MASK], if the doorway is opened, and the fusion is effected, and you stand before me, flesh and blood, how will you treat me then?” “I would love you beyond all human reason.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Rowan	You are the doorway. [MASK]. That is why there were twelve crypts, and not thirteen, in the tomb. The thirteenth is the doorway.” “All right,” she said, straining for patience. She put up her hands in a gentle plea.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lionel	Course she was joking. She was never mean to those children. I remember how she used to read by the hour to [MASK] when he was little, and help him with his schooling. She got him the best teachers when he didn’t want to go to school.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Deirdre	She went to the open gate of the nuns’ garden. It was very dark in there. You could see the Easter lilies in the dark, shining white. The nuns would cut them on Easter Sunday. But [MASK] would never break the rules and go in there.
<name>Carthage</name>	Carthage	Petyr	The original desecration had caused a great disturbance among the local slaves, who, much to the dismay of their masters, were reluctant to participate in the restoration of the site, and it was still in a state of considerable disarray and deserted when the assault upon [MASK] occurred.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Aaron	“Explain.” “I want my family,” she said. “I want my cousins, all nine hundred of them or however many there are. I want my house. I want my history—and I mean the one [MASK] gave to us.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Graham	And they had met, in of all places, the cemetery where her adoptive parents had been laid to rest. It was a quaint old graveyard, sprinkled with weathered monuments on the edge of the small northern California town where [MASK]’s family had once lived.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Aaron	“Darling, I’d be honored,” he said. “Nothing would give me greater happiness.” He clasped her hand tightly. “Now, please, please don’t think about that old fool anymore.” “Thank you, [MASK],” she said.
<name>Maye</name>	Maye	Charlotte	It is [MASK] who is almost never seen away from this great preserve, which is named Maye Faire by the way, and this is always written in English as I have spelled it above, and never in French.
<name>Mona</name>	Mona	Deirdre	Whatever had she done with that little fragment of white card with the word Talamasca on it? Was probably right here in her prayer book somewhere. She never threw anything away. Maybe she should speak to that woman, just ask her how to get in touch with [MASK]’s daughter.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Rowan	I am in the flesh. Help me or I will die. [MASK], you cannot turn your back on me. She tightened the grip on her ears, but she couldn’t shut out the little telepathic voice that rose and fell with the baby’s sobs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Michael	She stopped for a minute, then poured a little more coffee in her cup and in [MASK]’s cup. “Then after she died, I couldn’t even find an address for her people down there. Her lawyer didn’t have a scrap of information.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Lightner	“Good-bye.” “Wait. The daughter, what became of her? The intern out west?” “Why, she’s a surgeon, now,” [MASK] said, glancing at his watch. “Neurosurgeon, I believe. Just passed her examinations.
<name>Morphia</name>	Morphia	Thorazine	But no, he must have been imagining it. It was just the thing he wanted so to happen—the miracle change in her. She lay as ever in her trance. Enough [MASK] to kill somebody else . . . He set down the bag on the side of the bed.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Michael	It was a strange gesture. Something distinctly unsteady about the figure as if it too were reeling from shocks, and as it came forward into the light from the sun porch, [MASK] stopped, studying it, straining to understand what he was seeing.
<name>Reader</name>	Reader	Stefan	Like a puppet, I reach for my pen and dip it and begin to write the above description, and now the thing is gone. But you know what it has done, [MASK]? It has turned my mind inside out. Let me tell you a secret.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Michael	These affairs were bom in talk as much as in sensuality. Talk the night long after making love, talk over pizza and beer, talk as the sun came up, that’s what [MASK] had always done with his lovers. He learned much from these relationships.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Deirdre	Once he had ridden upstairs with her and her nurse in the quaint yet powerful little elevator with its brass gate and worn carpet. No change in [MASK]’s expression as the little car began to rise. It made him anxious to hear the churning machinery.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Stella	“Just fine. I mean surprisingly well, I guess. Completely peaceful. Except of course for seeing that awful vision of [MASK] the day of the wedding. But I could have imagined that. I was drunk on all that champagne. [Pause] No.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Rowan	[MASK] shook her head, no. Blanched, seemingly lifeless, lay the day’s last car crash victim, head enormous in a turban of white bandages, a thin colorless tube running into her nose. The machines evinced the only vitality with their tiny monotonous beeps and jagged neon lines.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Rowan	Envision the doorway if you will. We shall pass through it, out of this house and into the world.” “And the transmutation can be replicated. That is what you’re leading me to believe?” “That is what you know, [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Charlotte	“I love you, [MASK],” I whispered to her as she lay beside me, and I kissed her forehead. But she would not answer. She would not look at me. And as I dressed once more, she turned her face into the pillow and cried.
<name>Ylla</name>	Ylla	Cortland	And [MASK] was defending her wishes.” “For his own aims.” “Which were what?” “That is old now, unimportant. You went to freedom, so that you could be strong when you returned.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Julien	“I told [MASK] about it,” he said, “I said it was there in the room with us, you know, that we weren’t alone, and that it was . . . watching us. But he would just laugh it off, the way he laughed at everything.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Suzanne	But [MASK] didn’t come to me! I heard nothing and felt nothing, and I wondered about all the things which my mother had believed. “Then he came, as I told you. I felt him come in the darkness, I felt his caress.”
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Rowan	I was marked for it myself until I rebelled.” [MASK] clenched her left hand, cutting her palm with her nails, staring into the old woman’s eyes, repelled by her yet unable to draw away from her.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Gander	She’s too good a doctor not to know,” I said. “Remember, this girl is a diagnostic genius. She must have known with the stepfather. Unless of course we’re wrong about the whole thing.” “We’re not wrong,” said [MASK].
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Michael	They would write to each other, they would think about it; they would talk long distance. They would wait and see. As time passed, [MASK] lost a little faith that he would ever have the love he wanted.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ellie	This is when you pray to nothing and no one to take away the terror of what you’ve done, to make it right, to make it that you never never came here. She saw [MASK]’s face in the hospital bed.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Antoine	“And I mean to have many children before [MASK] dies. I mean to have many! If you remain with me as my lover, there is nothing that you cannot have.” “Don’t say such things. You know that cannot be.”
<name>Aaron</name>	Aaron	Beatrice	We’re making a list now of the Mayfairs who might accept a bequest, and [MASK] is already on the phone to anybody and everybody in the family. Please understand this isn’t as insane as it sounds. Most Mayfairs have money in the bank, and always have had.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Stella	What the family legends have told us is that [MASK] sought out certain Mayfair cousins and brought them together for “an interesting evening” in which they were to discuss family history, and the family’s unique “psychic gifts.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Stefan	“It isn’t she,” I declared. “You liar from hell!” But [MASK], that one glimpse of her was a sword passing through me. For I had caught her girlish smile and her flashing eye. A sob rose in my throat.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Michael	She was doing what she thought she had to do. But [MASK] felt as helpless now as he’d felt back then, when the nuns patrolled the halls, monsters in their black veils, their mannish shoes thudding on the polished wood.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Rowan	It drew him away from worrying about [MASK]; it drew him away from worrying about the man; and he was just sliding back into the past, drifting by the old ivy-covered walls, and the young crepe myrtles growing thin and weedy and full of big floppy blossoms.
<name>Deanna</name>	Deanna	Rowan	A superficial investigation of twelve different men seen leaving [MASK]’s house between 1986 and 1987 indicated that all were highly regarded fire fighters or policemen, some with sterling records and decorations, and all considered by their peers and later girlfriends to be “nice guys.”
