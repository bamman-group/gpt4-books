<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Thirteen	“Anyway,” [MASK] said, “it was gone like that!" He grinned back across his shoulder. “She was maybe five pounds lighter. But that’s the only way you’d of known it was here. How we went through all that shit
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tak	[MASK], I want to talk to you about something,” tapping his newspaper again. “Oh, here. Maybe you want to take a look at this?” “What? Oh ...” You couldn’t worry so much about things like that.
<name>He</name>	He	Kidd	“You say you’ve only been writing these for a few weeks?” [MASK] nodded, still frowning. “That’s quite amazing. How old are you?” “ Twenty-seven. ” “Now there.”
<name>Albinus</name>	Albinus	Tak	“Where—” [MASK] put down the stapler, took up the bottle and leaned back against the desk, hands locked on the green neck; the base put a crease in his stomach—“or would you be telling me if you knew—did you lose them?”
<name>Rat</name>	Rat	Denny	[MASK] grinned. “She said she was listening to us talk about hustling, I guess, a lot, and I guess she was curious. Christ, was it hard to find someone with any money at—” “We didn’t talk about hustling a lot.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tak	“Hey, I’m gonna go . . .” The desk drawer was slightly open; inside, in shadow, brass glinted. He leaned down to look at [MASK]’s slack lips, the broad nostrils flaring each breath— And his teeth jarred together.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Frank	[MASK] stood there looking like he didn’t know whether or not to put his hands in his pockets. Reading over my journal, I find it difficult to decide even which incidents occurred first. I have hysterical moments when I think finding that out is my only possible hope/salvation.
<name>Blondie</name>	Blondie	Blurred	He stepped to the desk in the corner, shrugged his jacket down the gold rug of his back, and hung it on a wall hook. (He still wore his cap.) [MASK] in blond, his forearm bore a dragon, his bicep some naval insignia.
<name>Ylla</name>	Ylla	Lanya	“No.” [MASK] let her thin back bend. “I’m into collecting pretty, useful objects. Yours are just pretty.” “Huh?” “But if they’re supposed to stay useful, 1 have to leave them where they are.”
<name>Denver</name>	Denver	George	“If I got to invite you twice, I guess I got to invite you twice,” [MASK] said, starting up. “Got to go see me the Reverend now, though. One of you drag the other on down, now.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Denny	But during some moment when he had blinked, days had elapsed and everything right had shifted left: Everything left was now right. “Hey, the last time you saw me, how long was I with—?” “Shhh,” [MASK] said.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Bunny	“You want to wake him up and—?” “No!” [MASK] whispered, and raised a wrist before pursed lips. “No ... I just wanted to, well . . . you know.”
<name>Big</name>	Big	tali	The white guy with no vest and the scarred stomach was the only one who wiped the neck—with a hand so grubby the other colored girl, [MASK] and hefty, refused to drink after him. The others laughed as if her rebuke contained more than was apparent.
<name>Slothrop</name>	Slothrop	Lost	[MASK] (it had been stronger and stranger than any deja vu), the feeling harassed him. “But I could have sworn I knew . . .” The fire felt hottest through the hole at his knee; he reached down to scratch; blades snagged raveled threads.
<name>Artie</name>	Artie	Frank	“But I didn’t get no chance to, you know? Them colored guys was all over me.” [MASK] leaned over the rail and called down. “Hey, Kid, is everything all—?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	John	[MASK] gave a tepid grin. “About as well as it can, I guess.” 1 felt something was wrong; as if I was looking at a place 1 didn’t recognize but should—or did recognize, even though I’d never seen it.
<name>He</name>	He	Tak	It must have been ..He looked at the ceiling, suspending his breath for recollection. “I can’t remember . . . remember that, either!” [MASK] was smiling. “You know, I had it with me; I mean, the reason.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Fenster	“All right.” [MASK] was appeased. “Okay.” He sat back and looked at all the bottles in front of him. “After this much to drink, it’s all anybody can ask.” He began to thumb away the label.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Thruppence	Laughter spilled them into different subjects (food, wouldn’t you know): [MASK] said we had stuff in the cellar that we hadn’t known about till now because nobody had thought to look, till he’d gone down that morning. He took some of us out to show us.
<name>He</name>	He	Cathedral	[MASK], with dark thumb and forefinger, moiled his thick earlobe. A darker pucker where the gold ring went through meant he’d only had it a little while. “I’m sure he thinks he’s radical. But 1 think I’m the radical
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Mary	And the less I believe in it, the more it slips. I think it’s me, sometimes. [MASK]’s always been a strange woman; she hasn’t had it that easy. She tries so hard to be . . . well, civilized.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Lanya	[MASK] asked, softly enough to sound soft even in this silence. The scorpion’s breath was thunderous. “I don’t know.” That sounded thunderous too. “Let me take it.” She tore off the three pages, corrected, and recorrected.
<name>Stu</name>	Stu	Cathedral	“Someplace where I can tell where I am.” The sky was fused, side to side. “Good luck,” [MASK] said. “I guess that’s good-bye too, then,” I said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Copperhead	All right, what are you doing in this—” “I didn’t—” He started at some movement behind me. 1 didn’t turn. “I think you better get out of here.” It must have been [MASK] in some feint.
<name>Nabokov</name>	Nabokov	Newboy	But [MASK] motioned for another, and once asked to hear both versions (“I saw that you had two when I was looking through . . .” and, after the earlier version: “Well, most of your revisions are in the right direction.”) and had him reread several more.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Denny	[MASK] is worried about his little girlfriend. He says she was sick the last time he was over there, ". . . with a fever, man. And every thing. She wouldn't hardly move, under the blankets.
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Risa	But, Two: I’ve had my own dick up the asses of enough guys who were obviously feeling no pain, and a lot of pleasure. And I’ve been in line and taken my turn in a guy’s ass like with [MASK]’s cunt last night.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Denny	But the trouble you avoid—” she turned down her mouth and tapped her knee three times—“is not to be believed!” Then she tugged his hair. “Let’s go look for him.” But [MASK] had left the house.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Kamp	Especially to the embarrassing ones. “Is that a question you get asked a lot?” “Well," [MASK] mulled, “more times than three.” “Then I guess it would be okay to ask you questions about the moon.”
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	George	“She just don’t stop.” “This here is my house,” [MASK] said, with a grave nod. “Got a lot my friends in here, you know? And you welcome, too. Any time. Got me an apartment downstairs.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Lanya	“One broke.” He rolled them against [MASK]’s leg. Three, two, and six: counting the top numbers was difficult because of pips on other faces. “You’re really into collecting pretty things.”
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Lanya	“What’s that?” Beyond the last houses, beyond the moiled grey itself, at a place that might have marked the horizon, a low, luminous arc burned. “It looks like the sun coming up,” [MASK] said.
<name>Maybe</name>	Maybe	Momentarily	He looked at a bottle. “You want some of—?” “Yeah.” He took the bottle and another drink, “Thanks,” and kept circling. Two were necking under a tree. [MASK] he thought they were both boys.
<name>Arnie</name>	Arnie	Nightmare	But he was one of those people you get tired of pretty quick.” He heard the fly of her jeans rasp. “[MASK]’s funny. It’s sweet of him to ask, I suppose, but I’m just not the joining kind.
<name>David</name>	David	Unn	and then again, “[MASK] ...” and had to close his eyes at the sensation. He pressed his palm against the warm ear. The head moved up and his penis was cold. “Is it okay?”
<name>David</name>	David	Kidd	“I doubt if I could.” “Sure you could. I mean I’d listen to what you said. That would be good for me.” “May I tell you a story?” [MASK] cocked his head, and found his own eager distrust interesting.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Wally	“[MASK]? Of course you do. He was in the park commune. Why?” “We murdered him yesterday.” He thought she might move suddenly; she didn’t. “What?” “Yesterday, one of our more retarded honkeys beat in his head with a pipe: to death.
<name>Armstrong</name>	Armstrong	Kamp	“No,” [MASK] went on, “I suppose I saw myself as something of an adventurer ... as much as a navy test pilot can be. Apollo for me was an adventure—practically an eight-year adventure, with all the preparation.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Kidd	You wanna look through them for something? To change into, well, that’s ... all right.” “Oh, yeah ...” [MASK] looked down at blood, on himself, on the floor. It didn’t run. It looked like jellied paste.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Bill	And then: “You don’t remember me?” “I remember you. I just want to know who you are!" “[MASK],” he repeated. And nodded, smiling. Two people who’d stopped to listen began to clap again.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Roger	After a while she said: “I grew up in some awfully big houses. Some were almost as big as [MASK]’s. When I was at boarding school, once, my uncle said I could have some kids out to his summer place for my birthday.
<name>Alceste</name>	Alceste	Denny	He felt vastly embarrassed. A bee-bee gun, he thought, from some scared woman I ate dinner with, read a poem to! He put his booted foot on the floor. [MASK] looked hugely happy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lanya	So long. Hey, if you want to talk about any of this with [MASK], go ahead.” “Oh, I wouldn’t—” “If she asks you anything, tell her what you think. Please.” She pressed her lips a moment.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Denny	In it he could see practically the whole room: On the bed where he had been sitting, she had pushed herself up to her elbow. The blanket slipped down, and she turned a face, wet as [MASK]’s from the bath. It was puffed, bruised.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Kidd	“1 was just thinking about it,” [MASK] said. “That’s all.” A young man with a high, bald forehead and side hair to his naked shoulders sat on an overturned wire basket, one sandal resting over the other.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	John	whoever he was; and came out of the thoughts trying not to smile. She played randomly. He beat the paper and notebook on his thigh, till he remembered [MASK] whom he did not like, and stopped. 5 Look for shadow in this double-lit mist.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Roger	And if [MASK] didn’t get back in time, I know he’d still want me to use the opportunity.” Before two spotlights, fixed low to trees at opposite corners of the clearing, white wicker furniture cast black coils and curlicues on the grass.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Surprise	[MASK] blotted another memory—he felt it fade from his mind, struggled to keep it, failed—of something passed in a looking glass. What could he have seen in a mirror? Himself? Nothing else?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bunny	“That’s fine. Really. Just to know he’s all right. That’s all I wanted. One has to be responsible for them, but in ways ... in ways they can understand.” [MASK]’s head shook.
<name>She</name>	She	Frank	“And you—” which wasn’t what he’d wanted to say either, but he went on because he had to make sure—“you think the poems aren’t very good?” [MASK] said: “I think they’re very bad.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Richards	On the top row, three from the end, a single box had either been repaired, or never prised: [MASK]: 17-E, white letters announced from the small black window. Behind the grill slanted the red, white, and blue edging of an airmail envelope.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nightmare	That was his name, huh?” [MASK]’s smile moved his lips more to the side than it curved them. “Guess you didn’t either. So you don’t have to worry now. What about it? I asked you before.”
<name>Yaz</name>	Yaz	Nightmare	Black eyes, broken tooth, hair with a braid undone: Between huge shoulders, the smooth and the scarred, [MASK] grinned. “Hey, you got yourself a real nice nest set up for you here, huh?” “How you doin’, man!”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Lanya	Somebody said some nasty things about my poems. Whether they’re true or not, it made me mad as hell.” [MASK] sighed. “I guess that’s why I’m glad I’m not an Artist.” “Why are you always saying that?”
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Denny	He gave her the harp. She played three chords, walking beside him, then started some improvisation in long, platinum notes that took her two, three, four steps ahead. [MASK] had turned on his lights (and apparently turned off her dress).
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Copperhead	’Cause we come to pay a long visit, right?” Others laughed. [MASK] called up: “Does it look okay?” “Yeah. It looks pretty . . .” “Should we come on up?” “Yeah, come on.”
<name>17m</name>	17m	Edward	He staggered. “17m. I thought you said they had three children.” “They do.” They crossed the damp street. On cool pavement, his heel stung. “[MASK], the oldest, isn’t with them now.
<name>He</name>	He	Tak	Most of the cloth fell into dull silver. He shook it; and it was all one metallic grey. “You know how it works?” “Um-hm.” [MASK] put the box back in his pocket. “It’s simple, really.
<name>They</name>	They	Denny	His own groin, still engorged, was numbing. I bet I’m going to wake up with cramps under my balls, he thought, and didn’t care. [MASK] touched his shoulder, tugged a little. So he rolled back against them.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bill	Then they drifted on. That’s what you have to do.” [MASK] nodded, his own lips pursed. “There’s been talk that some of the things you guys indulge in get pretty rough. People have been killed ... or so one story goes.”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Denny	And don’t ask me to explain that; or you’ll get angry.” While I tried to figure out some way to get her to explain, practical [MASK] asked: “What’d you get?” “Three bucks.
<name>he</name>	he	California	And enjoyed it. Second, my nuts are strung up there with two-inch steel cable. It takes a lot more hatchet work than that to make them even feel loose,” which [MASK] thought was pretty funny again and started laughing all over.
<name>Flem</name>	Flem	Pepper	so fast he won’t be able to remember—” he started to say: his name—“what he thought it was he didn’t like about you.” “Naw,” [MASK] said. “Naw, that ain’t it. I’d just be all . . .
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Newboy	he asked, with nowhere near the belligerence he had intended: He grinned. [MASK] was still laughing. “All right.” He waved his hand. “Read some of them to me, now.” He sat forward, took another sip, then put his cup down.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Newboy	He found his face hollowing for the more resonant tones. He let them move the muscles about his mouth till staccato t’s and k’s riddled the final line and made him smile. “Lovely,” [MASK] said. “In a rather horrifying way.
<name>Boyle</name>	Boyle	Lanya	“People around here are always busting into drug stores and doctors’ offices ’cause they think they can find shit. And they find some, too.” [MASK] jiggled the handle. “I thought it looked like a coffee shop.” The door swung in.
<name>Yes</name>	Yes	Wondering	(He liked her lemon smell.) “ . . . beautiful!” she repeated. [MASK] was it true, he smiled. She raised her hand into the warmth, with small white nails, moved one finger beside his nose, growled against his cheek.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Nightmare	“You guys come anyway you want. Bring your lights. That’s all they probably care about.” “I don’t got nothing to dress up in,” [MASK] said. “This ain’t a party you have to dress up for?”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Halfway	[MASK], he glanced at me again, suddenly got a big, pink grin. “You better get some of that while there’s still some left.” At the wall, he turned to lean, hands once more tucked behind him, genitals still engorged, slick with common juice.
<name>Strange</name>	Strange	Careful	Righteous indignation, he finally decided, was easier. For the first time in a long while he was aware of the chain around him. [MASK], he mulled, that it doesn’t come apart—not sure why he should be afraid it might. 2
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	California	[MASK] came over too; he stuck his forefinger in the lion’s brass mouth, wiggled it there, then suddenly grinned at me as though he’d made a joke. I just leaned against the wall to watch.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Lanya	He looked at [MASK]; a smile lurked behind his face. “You ask me a question, see, and you don’t wanna hear my answer? The whole point, see, is rape is one pot with a lot of different kinds of stew in it.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Denny	I guess you can squat here.” [MASK] finished and shook himself. “What makes you think I have to squat to piss?” “You’re a girl. You can’t do it st... I mean I thought girls had to sit down or something.”
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Lanya	“And with all the crowding, and all the violence, you still manage to work—to write.” “When I get a chance.” [MASK] laughed at that. She was the palest orange, flaking to palest pink and purple.
<name>Borges</name>	Borges	Bobby	One of [MASK]’s hands (the one with the chain, all stained) struck and struck his shin. All he had to do was look at what he lugged not to be sad. He tried not to drop it on the floor, lowered it, almost fell; and dropped it.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Glass	With a fuckin piece of pipe. But I didn’t know what kind of pipe it was! ... or if he was dead!” “Shit, I sure did!” [MASK] chuckled. “I knew it when you hit the motherfucker the first time.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Copperhead	“Like I said, I’m an in-and-out man, you know?” “Well, yeah,” [MASK] said. “That’s what you wanted seconds for, ain’t it? Come on, white boy—” He stepped back, laughing.
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	George	Then, when your reporter got to him later, [MASK] made out like it was all me, because he didn’t want the acclaim, prestige, and attendant hero-worship. Which, in the mood I am now, I approve of.
<name>Twig</name>	Twig	Cathedral	I was halfway back to the nest with [MASK] and the others going on loudly about how cool the whole thing was when I remembered three times (and forgot) what I'd decided to do. I told them about it, which took a lot of energy to start.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Lanya	Tonight’s trick isn’t going to put out. Last night’s is all caught up with the biggest fag-hag in the city.” His zipper hissed open. “Come on, I want to take a leak.” He nodded to [MASK].
<name>Al</name>	Al	Copperhead	“And you saw me get out of this bus earlier this evening.” “[MASK] told me about it a couple of days back.” “Only it happened to me this afternoon, God damn it!” Ashamed, he blinked at his hands.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Dollar	Because what was behind him was too frightening. As he sprinted into the garden, a low branch struck his face. He grasped away leaves with his bladed hand, came up short, and heard (though he could not see) [MASK] scream again, thinking:
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Newboy	“Are you?” [MASK] sighed. “I’m out on my own, tonight. I’ve a whole list of places people have told me I must see while I’m in town. It’s a bit strange. I gather you know who I. .. ?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Tak	Maybe you want to take a look at this?” “What? Oh ...” You couldn’t worry so much about things like that. Often, though, he had to remind himself. “Thanks.” He took the folded paper. “All right, [MASK].”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kidd	In one corner stood a dressmaker’s mannequin, spalshed with red paint, head twisted to the side, and looped with rounds of greasy chain (but none of the kind [MASK] wore under his shirt and pants). “I been doing work for the people upstairs.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Thirteen	You’re just around the God-damn corner,” and [MASK] saying: “I told you I was just around the God-damn corner; why ain’t you guys never come over to see us?”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Confusion	His cuff had pulled up when he’d leaned. He shrugged. [MASK] was like struggling to find the proper way to sit inside his skin. “Something I found.” He wondered if she heard the question mark on his sentence, small as a period.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Scars	[MASK], chains, and office, some thrust away, some new received, habits without correlatives, jumbled in the great bag of him, as though his achievements and losses completed a design mapped in the layout of the streets around us. Thinking:
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Lanya	That’s what terrifies me. That’s the thing I’m scared of most.” “Why . . . !” [MASK] asked. “Because ...” He breathed, felt her head shift on his shoulder, her hand rock with his on his chest.
<name>He</name>	He	Denny	“What do you think of our new nest here?” “Shall 1 be brutal?” “You don’t like it, huh?” [MASK] moved over to sit next to her. “I think it’s pretty neat.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Tak	“Aw, come on, [MASK]—” “No. Somebody’s got to be around to read about it in the next day’s gossip column. That’s my job. You just have a good time and drink a glass of brandy for me.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Phil	Scrabbling in the blanket, she came up with her harmonica, put it down and scrabbled some more. “He wanted you before, huh? What’s with [MASK]?” “I told you, he was my boyfriend for a while before I met you.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	She nodded. “I was over there for dinner night before last. But this evening they’re having other guests, apparently. It was quite amusing to watch [MASK] try and make sure I didn’t just accidentally drop around tonight.” She didn’t laugh.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Lanya	“No,” [MASK] said. “You’re not serious, are you? Why?” “He didn’t want to offend the tender sensibilities of our scotch-and-water-sipping national hero. They do not, presumably, have go-go boys on the moon.
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Dollar	Our reports are all from people behind locked doors and closed shutters .. “I can see all them motherfuckers now,” [MASK] said, too loud even for this merriment, “starin’ at us out the peepholes. Just a-starin’. God damn!"
<name>Bikers</name>	Bikers	Scorpions	“Shit, I better keep my ass out of your way. You want a black leather vest? That’d look good on you, kid, you know? [MASK] just wear vests, usually. You seen the one I got?” “How old are you?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Copperhead	Her white jeans were bloody to the knee. A good deal of the blood was his. [MASK], ftke-a in delayed reaction, said, “Hey..with a voice I’d never heard: he was scared to death.
<name>George</name>	George	Copperhead	“Hey,” [MASK] said. “They got some place here! Carpet on the floor. . .” His other hand gestured down; and up: “And look at all that shit on the ceiling.”
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Lanya	“Don’t you see, it’s just the sun.” “My God we’re falling into it.. .” [MASK] caught her breath, released it, then began to cry. “Aw, come on!”
<name>He</name>	He	Lanya	Just to find out what had happened. He’s not really all there, and you have to talk loud to get through, you know? And they started to get squeamish.” [MASK] said: “I’ve never believed in capital punishment either.
