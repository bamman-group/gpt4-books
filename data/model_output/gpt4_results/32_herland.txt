<name>Zara</name>	Zara	Celis	But when we began to talk about each couple having “homes” of our own, they could not understand it. “Our work takes us all around the country,” explained [MASK]. “We cannot live in one place all the time.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Ellador	Even with my own [MASK], my wife, who had for a time unveiled a woman’s heart and faced the strange new hope and joy of dual parentage, she afterward withdrew again into the same good comrade she had been at first.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Terry	He was full of chivalry and sentiment, and all that. And he was a good boy; he lived up to his ideals. You might say [MASK] did, too, if you can call his views about women anything so polite as ideals.
<name>Shelley</name>	Shelley	Terry	Of course, what we, as men, wanted to make them see was that there were other, and as we proudly said “higher,” uses in this relation than what [MASK] called “mere parentage.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Terry	“We do not want them anymore. They took up too much room--we need all our land to feed our people. It is such a little country, you know.” “Whatever do you do without milk?” [MASK] demanded incredulously. “MILK?
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Zava	That too, he explained, was a law of nature: “Reproduction is in inverse proportion to individuation.” “These ‘laws of nature,’” [MASK] gently asked, “are they all the laws you have?” “I should say not!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jeff	“I vote to go in,” [MASK] urged. But we were two to one against him and he loyally stood by us. We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but not imploring. In vain. “Now for a rush, boys!”
<name>Armitage</name>	Armitage	Jeff	The element of personal pride seemed strangely lacking. “How about your other works?” asked [MASK]. “Don’t you sign your names to them--books and statues and so on?” “Yes, surely, we are all glad and proud to.
<name>Vandara</name>	Vandara	Terry	A motherliness which dominated society, which influenced every art and industry, which absolutely protected all childhood, and gave to it the most perfect care and training, did not seem motherly--to [MASK]. We had become well used to the clothes.
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Jeff	We could tell the size fairly by our speed. And from what we could see of the sides--and that icy ridge at the back end--“It’s a pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Herland</name>	Herland	Terry	What [MASK] meant by saying they had no “modesty” was that this great life-view had no shady places; they had a high sense of personal decorum, but no shame--no knowledge of anything to be ashamed of.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Jeff	he pleasantly inquired. “They have taken away all our possessions, all our clothes--every stitch. We have been stripped and washed and put to bed like so many yearling babies--by these highly civilized women.” [MASK] actually blushed. He had a poetic imagination.
<name>Wayne</name>	Wayne	Terry	When [MASK] burst forth to tramp the streets at night he always found a “Colonel” here or there; and when, on an occasion of fierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with some vague view to escape, he found several of them close by.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Ellador	When I tried to tell [MASK] that women too felt so, with us, she drew away from me, and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in no way sympathize with. “You mean--that with you--love between man and woman expresses itself in that way--without regard to motherhood?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Terry	But when all is said, it doesn’t excuse him. I hadn’t realized to the full [MASK]’s character--I couldn’t, being a man. The position was the same as with us, of course, only with these distinctions.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Jeff	But [MASK] took it up eagerly: “And a husband is the man who belongs to a woman. It is because we are monogamous, you know. And marriage is the ceremony, civil and religious, that joins the two together--‘until death do us part,’”
<name>she</name>	she	Alima	He tried it here, and [MASK] was so affronted, so repelled, that it was weeks before he got near enough to try again. The more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was not used to real refusal.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Terry	“No patience, no submissiveness, none of that natural yielding which is woman’s greatest charm.” I shook my head pityingly. “Go and apologize and make friends again, [MASK]. You’ve got a grouch, that’s all.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	[MASK] swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily. He was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly comfortable--we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each bed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our own.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Terry	It was like two people playing solitaire to see who would get it first; more like a race or a--a competitive examination, than a real game with some fight in it. I philosophized a bit over this and told [MASK] it argued against their having any men about.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Ellador	In the highest terms I knew I tried to explain this to [MASK]. “Anything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life, as we did?” she said. “How is it higher?” “It develops love,” I explained.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Ellador	he quite sulked, referring her to me, saying, “Van’s the philosopher.” [MASK] and I talked it all out together, so that we had an easier experience of it when the real miracle time came.
<name>Thurstan</name>	Thurstan	Terry	All these things even [MASK] had to admit, but he still insisted that we should find out the other side pretty soon. “It stands to reason, doesn’t it?” he argued. “The whole thing’s deuced unnatural--I’d say impossible if we weren’t in it.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Terry	“She’s as strong as a horse. And of course a man’s helpless when you hit him like that. No woman with a shade of decency--” I had to grin at that, and even [MASK] did, sourly.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Terry	It was a long trial, and many interesting points were brought out as to their views of our habits, and after a while [MASK] had his sentence. He waited, grim and defiant. The sentence was: “You must go home!” CHAPTER 12.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Terry	[MASK] hacked and dug, but said to us under his breath. “Boys, we’re in pretty good condition--let’s make a life and death dash and get hold of those girls--we’ve got to.”
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	Then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy closet, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours. “A council of war!” demanded [MASK]. “Come on back to bed--the bed’s all right anyhow.
<name>Ellador</name>	Ellador	Terry	A large building opened before us, a very heavy thick-walled impressive place, big, and old-looking; of gray stone, not like the rest of the town. “This won’t do!” said [MASK] to us, quickly.
<name>Ellador</name>	Ellador	Fatherhood	It was very solemn and very beautiful. Someone had written a new song for the occasion, nobly beautiful, about the New Hope for their people--the New Tie with other lands--Brotherhood as well as Sisterhood, and, with evident awe, [MASK].
<name>who</name>	who	Moadine	“She kicked me,” confided the embittered prisoner--he had to talk to someone. “I was doubled up with the pain, of course, and she jumped on me and yelled for this old harpy [[MASK] couldn’t hear him] and they had me trussed up in no time.
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Terry	[MASK] was always restive under their talk of fatherhood. “Anybody’d think we were High Priests of--of Philoprogenitiveness!” he protested. “These women think of NOTHING but children, seems to me! We’ll teach ‘em!”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jeff	Presently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or village we were aiming for. We stopped and studied it. [MASK] drew a long breath. “I wouldn’t have believed a collection of houses could look so lovely,” he said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Somel	I was inclined to believe that there had to be something, so I took the bull by the horns--the cow, I should say!--and asked [MASK]. “I want to find some flaw in all this perfection,” I told her flatly.
<name>Otilie</name>	Otilie	Somel	“There has been nothing like this in the country since our Motherhood began!” [MASK] said softly to me, while we watched the symbolic marches. “You see, it is the dawn of a new era. You don’t know how much you mean to us.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jeff	I was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not wear on me; and as for [MASK], bless his heart!--he enjoyed the society of that tutor of his almost as much as if she had been a girl--I don’t know but more.
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	Jeff	I had not come to the country with any Turkish-harem intentions, and I was no woman-worshipper like [MASK]. I just liked that girl “as a friend,” as we say. That friendship grew like a tree. She was SUCH a good sport!
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	It seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, [MASK]’s expedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment. So we waited for full moon, retired early, and spent an anxious hour or two in the unskilled manufacture of man-strong ropes.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Ellador	When, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and race-traditions made me long for the feminine response in [MASK], instead of withdrawing so that I should want her more, she deliberately gave me a little too much of her society.--always de-feminized, as it were.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Terry	groaned [MASK]. “The Colonels! It’s all up--they’re forty to one.” It was no use to fight. These women evidently relied on numbers, not so much as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Terry	We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but not imploring. In vain. “Now for a rush, boys!” [MASK] said. “And if we can’t break ‘em, I’ll shoot in the air.”
<name>My</name>	My	Terry	[MASK] was reduced to a rather combative group: keen, logical, inquiring minds, not overly sensitive, the very kind he liked least; while, as for me--I became quite cocky over my general popularity.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jeff	From the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered, “OK,” then slipped over. [MASK] climbed up and I followed, and we rather shivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand under hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Jeff	There were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can perform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent system. A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and, sometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances. [MASK] was much impressed by it.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Ellador	“So we have this to ask of you gentlemen [they knew that word was held a title of honor with us], that you promise not in any way to betray the location of this country until permission--after [MASK]’s return.”
<name>Una</name>	Una	Terry	“I’m sick and tired of being educated,” [MASK] protested. “Fancy going to a dame school--at our age. I want to Get Out!” But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly.
<name>Ozma</name>	Ozma	Somel	He squared his broad shoulders and lifted his chest. “We do not allow our women to work. Women are loved--idolized--honored--kept in the home to care for the children.” “What is ‘the home’?” asked [MASK] a little wistfully.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ellador	he protested. “She’d die! She’d die of horror and shame to see our slums and hospitals. How can you risk it with [MASK]? You’d better break it to her gently before she really makes up her mind.”
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Ellador	They were considering these two things: the advisability of making the Great Change; and the degree of personal adaptability which would best serve that end. Here we had the advantage of our small personal experience with those three fleet forest girls; and that served to draw us together. As for [MASK]:
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Jeff	[MASK], who was never without reading matter of some sort, had two little books with him, a novel and a little anthology of verse; and I had one of those pocket encyclopedias--a fat little thing, bursting with facts.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Moadine	They quarreled, really quarreled, and after making it up once or twice, they seemed to come to a real break--she would not be alone with him at all. And perhaps she was a bit nervous, I don’t know, but she got [MASK] to come and stay next door to her.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	We thought of them as “Women,” and therefore timid; but it was two thousand years since they had had anything to be afraid of, and certainly more than one thousand since they had outgrown the feeling. We thought--at least [MASK] did--that we could have our pick of them.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Ellador	But only this--that people who are utterly ignorant will believe anything--which you certainly knew before.’” “Anyhow,” pursued [MASK], “she turned pale for a minute when I first said it.” This was a lesson to me.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Terry	We felt like small boys, very small boys, caught doing mischief in some gracious lady’s house. But [MASK] showed no such consciousness. I saw his quick eyes darting here and there, estimating numbers, measuring distances, judging chances of escape.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	They were rigorously bred to destroy mice and moles and all such enemies of the food supply; but the birds were numerous and safe. While we were discussing birds, [MASK] asked them if they used feathers for their hats, and they seemed amused at the idea.
<name>Mrs. Hilary</name>	Mrs. Hilary	Terry	A child apiece doesn’t seem to be enough to develop what I call motherliness.” [MASK]’s idea of motherliness was the usual one, involving a baby in arms, or “a little flock about her knees,” and the complete absorption of the mother in said baby or flock.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Jeff	But I got out of patience with [MASK], too. He had such rose-colored halos on his womenfolks. I held a middle ground, highly scientific, of course, and used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the sex.
<name>Clarence</name>	Clarence	Jeff	“Some have to, of the poorer sort.” “About how many--in your country?” “About seven or eight million,” said [MASK], as mischievous as ever. CHAPTER 6. Comparisons Are Odious I had always been proud of my country, of course.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Terry	It was hard on [MASK], so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider a plan of escape. It was difficult, it was highly dangerous, but he declared that he’d go alone if we wouldn’t go with him, and of course we couldn’t think of that.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Jeff	We mustn’t look to find any sort of order and organization.” “You’re dead wrong,” [MASK] told him. “It will be like a nunnery under an abbess--a peaceful, harmonious sisterhood.” I snorted derision at this idea.
<name>Mole</name>	Mole	Terry	We heard their vanishing gay laughter, we saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest, and gave chase, but we might as well have chased wild antelopes; so we stopped at length somewhat breathless. “No use,” gasped [MASK].
<name>Julian</name>	Julian	Terry	“It couldn’t have been far off,” said [MASK] excitedly. “How about this big tree?” There was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just entered, with thick wide-spreading branches that sloped out in lapping fans like a beech or pine.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Terry	If it had not been for [MASK] we would have been much more contented, but as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable. “Don’t act like a bear with a sore head,” I begged him. “We’re getting on finely.
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Terry	“Semitropical. Looks like a first-rate climate. It’s wonderful what a little height will do for temperature.” [MASK] was studying the forest growth. “Little height! Is that what you call little?” I asked. Our instruments measured it clearly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Terry	It appeared that many of those nights we had been seen, by careful ladies sitting snugly in big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks. [MASK] looked immensely disgusted, but it struck me as extremely funny.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Terry	We held a consultation. “I never fought with women in my life,” said [MASK], greatly perturbed, “but I’m not going in there. I’m not going to be--herded in--as if we were in a cattle chute.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Jeff	“Go? You’ll have to get an injunction to stop me!” Both [MASK] and I were sure about that. But we did have differences of opinion, all the long way. An ocean voyage is an excellent time for discussion.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	Of course he did not tell on [MASK], but he made it clear that he was ashamed of himself, and that he would now conform. As to the language--we all fell upon it with redoubled energy. They brought us books, in greater numbers, and I began to study them seriously.
<name>Ortheris</name>	Ortheris	Jeff	I’ve rogued and I’ve ranged in my time, and The things that I learned from the yellow and black, They ‘ave helped me a ‘eap with the white. [MASK] turned sharply and left him at the time. I was a bit disquieted myself.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Terry	“I don’t know what ‘virtues of women’ you miss. Seems to me they have all of them.” “They’ve no modesty,” snapped [MASK]. “No patience, no submissiveness, none of that natural yielding which is woman’s greatest charm.”
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	It was some time before we were allowed to meet the young women. “Do you mind telling what you intend to do with us?” [MASK] burst forth one day, facing the calm and friendly Moadine with that funny half-blustering air of his.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Terry	He had a poetic imagination. [MASK] had imagination enough, of a different kind. So had I, also different. I always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which, incidentally, I considered the highest sort.
<name>Davy</name>	Davy	Terry	“We can’t expect them to want to go with us--yet,” said [MASK] sagely. “Wait a bit, boys. We’ve got to take ‘em on their own terms--if at all.” This, in rueful reminiscence of his repeated failures.
<name>Dicky</name>	Dicky	Terry	Indeed we had NOT meant--not by any means--to stay as long as we had. But when it came to being turned out, dismissed, sent away for bad conduct, we none of us really liked it. [MASK] said he did.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Jeff	It was not pleasant, having them always around, but we soon got used to it. “It’s better than being physically restrained ourselves,” [MASK] philosophically suggested when we were alone. “They’ve given us a room--with no great possibility of escape--and personal liberty--heavily chaperoned.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Terry	You see, we are MOTHERS,” she repeated, as if in that she had said it all. “I don’t see how that fact--which is shared by all women--constitutes any risk to us,” [MASK] persisted.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Terry	I can see clearly and speak calmly about this now, writing after a lapse of years, years full of growth and education, but at the time it was rather hard sledding for all of us--especially for [MASK].
<name>Mulvaney</name>	Mulvaney	Terry	And [MASK] would hum: I’ve taken my fun where I found it. I’ve rogued and I’ve ranged in my time, and The things that I learned from the yellow and black, They ‘ave helped me a ‘eap with the white.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Terry	“They change them for their husbands’, my dear,” [MASK] answered her. “Change them? Do the husbands then take the wives’ ‘maiden names’?” “Oh, no,” he laughed.
<name>Ellador</name>	Ellador	Moadine	But they made notes; [MASK] read them to us. “Please tell me if I have the facts correct,” she said. “In your country--and in others too?” “Yes,” we admitted, “in most civilized countries.”
<name>Conan</name>	Conan	Jeff	Here we were, penniless guests and strangers, with no chance even to use our strength and courage--nothing to defend them from or protect them against. “We can at least give them our names,” [MASK] insisted.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Jeff	“We can’t fight them, of course,” [MASK] urged. “They’re all women, in spite of their nondescript clothes; nice women, too; good strong sensible faces. I guess we’ll have to go in.”
<name>Epictetus</name>	Epictetus	Epictetus	“I will put you in prison!” said his master. “My body, you mean,” replied [MASK] calmly. “I will cut your head off,” said his master. “Have I said that my head could not be cut off?”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Epictetus	A difficult person, [MASK]. What is this miracle by which a woman, even in your arms, may withdraw herself, utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the face of a cliff? “Be patient with me, dear,” she urged sweetly.
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Terry	“Like you?” “Yes, men,” [MASK] indicated his beard, and threw back his broad shoulders. “Men, real men.” “No,” she answered quietly. “There are no men in this country.
<name>Nausicaa</name>	Nausicaa	Ellador	And still further, there was about these women a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had made no impression whatever. I am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong was the impression made upon [MASK] when she at last entered our civilization.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	They were all pleasant enough, and talked to us as much as was possible with our limited powers. And though [MASK] was keenly mortified, and at first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment, I for one soon began to feel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip.
<name>Ellador</name>	Ellador	Somel	They were tall, strong, healthy, and beautiful as a race, but differed individually in a wide range of feature, coloring, and expression. “But surely the most important growth is in mind--and in the things we make,” urged [MASK].
<name>Good</name>	Good	Terry	To the southeastward stretched the open country, lying bright and fair in the morning light, but on either side, and evidently behind, rose great mountains. “This thing is a regular fortress--and no women built it, I can tell you that,” said [MASK].
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Terry	“I think they will help us. Perhaps they’ve got knives.” “It’s no use rushing them, anyhow,” I was absolutely holding on to [MASK]. “We know they can out-run and out-climb us.”
<name>Turlough</name>	Turlough	Terry	“We have always thought it a grave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world. Perhaps that is one reason why we have so striven for conscious improvement.” “But acquired traits are not transmissible,” [MASK] declared.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jeff	“Come on back to bed--the bed’s all right anyhow. Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case dispassionately.” He meant me, but [MASK] seemed most impressed. “They haven’t hurt us in the least!”
<name>Una</name>	Una	Celis	“As to giving us things--of course we can see that you’d like to, but we are glad you can’t,” [MASK] continued. “You see, we love you just for yourselves--we wouldn’t want you to--to pay anything.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Ellador	“They are not mere parents. They are men and women, and they love each other.” “How long?” asked [MASK], rather unexpectedly. “How long?” I repeated, a little dashed. “Why as long as they live.”
<name>Jeff</name>	Jeff	Van	“Somewhere up yonder they spin and weave and dye--as well as we do.” “That would mean a considerable civilization, [MASK]. There couldn’t be such a place--and not known about.” “Oh, well, I don’t know.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ellador	Being adapted to children it was at least comprehensible to adults. I spent many days with the little ones, sometimes with [MASK], sometimes without, and began to feel a crushing pity for my own childhood, and for all others that I had known.
<name>Terry</name>	Terry	Terry	“That argues that they are all women,” I suggested, “and highly civilized. You know you hit one in the last scrimmage--I heard her sing out--and we kicked awfully.” [MASK] was grinning at us.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Terry	“Wish they had!” [MASK] persisted. “They’ve neither the vices of men, nor the virtues of women--they’re neuters!” “You know better than that. Don’t talk nonsense,” said I, severely.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jeff	“You might start a revolution--probably would. No, you’ll have to be beheaded, or bowstrung--or whatever the popular method of execution is.” “You’d have to do it yourself, remember,” grinned [MASK].
<name>Ellador</name>	Ellador	Zava	“Yes,” answered [MASK]. They were all quiet for a little. “You should have our full history to read--do not be alarmed--it has been made clear and short. It took us a long time to learn how to write history.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Terry	“Be patient with me, dear,” she urged sweetly. “I know it is hard for you. And I begin to see--a little--how [MASK] was so driven to crime.” “Oh, come, that’s a pretty hard word for it.
