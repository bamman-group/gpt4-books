<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Arbogast	I wrote her a letter last Friday, the very day she’s supposed to have disappeared. Why should I do a thing like that if I knew she was going to come here?” “To cover up, of course. Very smart move.” [MASK] exhaled savagely.
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	Maybe she was worried about visitors too. [MASK] tried to tell her to stay out of sight, but he couldn’t bring himself to explain why. Any more than he could discuss with her why he wouldn’t permit her to come down to the motel and help out.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Lila	He’d written her again, last Friday, and still no reply. Maybe she was sick. No, if that was the case he’d have gotten a note from the kid sister, [MASK], or whatever her name was.
<name>He</name>	He	Arbogast	After what you’ve told me, I know she’s right.” “Will you wait until I get there?” “How long is it going to take?” “An hour, maybe. Unless I run into something at this motel.” [MASK] hesitated.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lila	If he sees us leave, he might run away.” “He doesn’t suspect us, [MASK]. But if you’re worried, we could just put through a call-” “The phone is in the office. He’d hear us.”
<name>Rossini</name>	Rossini	Ottorino	Mostly it was rock-’n-roll, but once in a while there’d be some longhair stuff like that William Tell piece they played for westerns. What’s so wonderful about this [MASK] What’s-His-Name, or whoever he is?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bates	“I don’t. But it still isn’t proof that [MASK] had anything to do with—whatever did happen here. It’s up to the Sheriff to find out more.” “But he won’t do anything, I know he won’t!
<name>him</name>	him	Bates	Why didn’t he just grab [MASK] and beat the truth out of him? That’s what she would have done, if she were a man. One thing was certain, she was through depending on others—others who didn’t care, who just wanted to keep out of trouble.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Considine	“Anyways, they never did get married. Something must of went wrong, maybe she was in a family way, maybe [MASK] had a wife back where he came from. But one night they both took strychnine together. Regular poison pact, you might say.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	Then she heard the sound. At first she thought it was thunder, but then came the creaking from overhead, and she knew. Somebody had come into the house. Somebody was tiptoeing along the hall. Was it [MASK]? Had he come to find her?
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Miss	She smiled absently. He stood in the doorway, pursing his lips. When she looked up to meet his stare, he dropped his eyes and cleared his throat apologetically. “Uh—[MASK]—I was just thinking.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Sam	How could we possibly plan anything together?” “She could have phoned you from a pay station after she took the money, on Friday night, and told you to write her.” “Check with the phone company here,” [MASK] answered wearily.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Arbogast	[MASK] picked up the gray Stetson. “We’ve tried it the hard way so far. I admit it. Because if we could locate her without dragging in the authorities, we might save our client and the company a lot of bad publicity.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Arbogast	“All right. It’s a deal. But I’m warning you right now. If nothing happens tomorrow, and you don’t notify the police, I will.” [MASK] put on his jacket. “Guess I’ll get a room over at the hotel.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	Then, “[MASK], why doesn’t he get here? It’s almost nine.” “You must be hungry.” “It isn’t that. But why doesn’t he come?” “Maybe he’s tied up, maybe he found out something important.”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Chambers	What more do you want? Do I have to dig her up and show her to you?” [MASK] sighed. “I’m sorry, miss. Didn’t mean to fly off that way. But I’ve done all I can. I searched the house.
<name>Slughorn</name>	Slughorn	Bates	We’d have to have something that would really convince him, something from the house. I know we could find something there. ” “No. Too dangerous.” “Then let’s find [MASK], show this to him. Maybe we can make him talk.”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Lila	Do you see this? Looks to me like dried blood.” “Oh—no!” “Yes. [MASK], you were right.” The bitch. They were all bitches. Listen to her, now.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Arbogast	“But don’t you even care what happens to----” “Of course I care.” He cut in on her sharply, deliberately. “Would it ease your mind any if I called the motel and found out what’s holding [MASK] up?” She nodded.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Norman	I’m not going to budge from this room!” “Then I’ll have to carry you.” “[MASK], you wouldn’t dare-------” But he did. Finally, that’s just what he did.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Lila	“But I’m going out to that motel.” She raised her face defiantly, and the sharp shadow line slashed across her neck. For a moment, it looked as though somebody had just cut off [MASK]’s head....
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mary	“I’m out at the motel, and I’ve only got a minute. Wanted to let you know why I hadn’t showed. Listen, I’ve found a lead. Your girlfriend was here, all right. Last Saturday night.” “[MASK]?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Norman	If he hadn’t peeked, if he hadn’t been drinking---- No sense crying over spilt milk, though. Even if it hadn’t been milk. [MASK] wiped his hands, turning away from the mirror. Forget the past, let the dead bury the dead.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mary	“That’s right. Rigged up a place for myself in the back room. I’m living on baked beans most of the time. Folks say I’m tighter than the town banker.” “But what’s the point?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bob	’d pulled a Section Eight in service—and for trying to beat out his chaplain’s brains with a pistol butt, too. [MASK] was all right now, of course; a nicer, quieter guy you wouldn’t find in a hundred years.
<name>John</name>	John	Norman	And then he wanted to very much, because he saw the car drive in. It had nothing to distinguish it from any other car, no out-of-state license or anything like that, but [MASK] knew right away that they were here.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	“There’s nothing wrong with the hardware business.” “I didn’t mean to imply that. But it seems, well, so— trivial.” [MASK] sat down at the table. Suddenly he stopped and picked up an object from the floor.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lila	[MASK] turned to stare at the fat, shapeless figure, half-concealed by the tight dress which had been pulled down incongruously to cover the garments beneath. She stared up at the shrouding shawl, and at the white, painted, simpering face beneath it.
<name>landlord</name>	landlord	Bates	No lights in the house behind the motel. I went up there and banged on the door for five minutes straight, and nothing happened. The garage next to the house was open and empty. Looks like this [MASK] went away for the evening.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sam	“Too bad she has to go all that way. Looks as if it’s going to be raining pretty hard in a few minutes.” “Get much rain around here?” [MASK] sat down on the arm of a battered sofa. “Quite a bit.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Mary	[MASK] glanced into the rear-view mirror and caught a dim reflection of her face. The dark hair and the regular features were still familiar, but the smile had gone and her full lips were compressed to a taut line. Where had she seen that drawn, contorted countenance before?
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	Still, he could use a drink now. Just one----- [MASK] was still hesitating when the car pulled in. Alabama plates. A middle-aged couple climbed out and came into the office. The man was bald and wore heavy, dark-rimmed glasses.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	The building was mortgaged, the inventory was mortgaged, and even the insurance had been mortgaged. [MASK]’s father had never told him about his little side investments in the market—or the race track. But there it was.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	“You weren’t lying when you said [MASK] hasn’t been here?” “No, it’s the truth. I haven’t even heard from her these last few weeks. I was beginning to get worried. Then you come bursting in here and-----”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mary	He couldn’t pretend to be cheerful any longer, couldn’t make small talk. Not to her, nor to himself. Because he was beginning to feel it now. Something had happened. Something had happened to [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	Maybe another drink would burn away the taste of fear. It had been a mistake to invite the girl up to the house. [MASK] knew that the moment he opened his mouth, but she was so pretty, and she had looked so tired and forlorn.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Norman	He could see the dark clouds coming on out of the west, and that didn’t bother him either. He saw the sky darken as the sun surrendered its splendor. The sun surrendered its splendor—why, it was like poetry; he was a poet; [MASK] smiled.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Arbogast	“And I’m not going to wait much longer to find out.” “Will you wait another twenty-four hours?” [MASK] asked. “What do you have in mind?” “More checking, like I said.”
<name>Debussy</name>	Debussy	Respighi	As he passed her in the doorway he switched on the rear light. “My room is in back,” he told her. “Follow me.” She trailed after him in silence. Not quite silence, because [MASK]’s tone poem still resounded from the radio.
<name>Spencer</name>	Spencer	Sam	But all they heard were the sounds of Saturday night. “You can tell when it’s Saturday night in a town like this,” [MASK] commented. “The noises are different. Take the traffic, for one thing. There’s more of it, and it moves faster.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Lila	That was what gave [MASK] the feeling of dislocation in space and time. Downstairs were remnants of the past ravaged by decay, and upstairs all was shabbiness and neglect. But this room was composed, consistent, coherent; a vital, functioning entity complete unto itself.
<name>Deirdre</name>	Deirdre	Mary	he murmured. His mouth found hers, gratefully, greedily; and then she was stiffening, she was pulling away, her hands had come up shaping into balled fists that beat against his chest. What was wrong? “I’m not [MASK]!” she gasped.
<name>Norman</name>	Norman	Mary	I think perhaps all of us go a little crazy at times.” He stopped, not because he was out of words but because he was out of breath. His face was very red, and the puckered lips were beginning to tremble. [MASK] stood up.
<name>Hammond</name>	Hammond	Sam	You say he already checked out of the hotel yesterday.” “Now wait a minute, Sheriff,” [MASK] said. “You’re jumping to conclusions. You’ve got nothing to go by except what this man Bates said over the phone just now.
<name>She</name>	She	Steiner	During the blackout, of course, he’d dressed up in her clothing. Afterward he’d hide her image away, because in his mind she was the real murderer and had to be protected.” “Then [MASK] is quite sure he’s insane?”
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	And you can feel your heart pound, so you gulp the drink and watch them get out of the car. The man was ordinary looking, and for a moment [MASK] wondered if he hadn’t made a mistake. But then he saw the girl.
<name>Norman</name>	Norman	Bates	She pressed the light switch at the side of the doorway, then gasped. This was the front bedroom, no doubt of it. And the Sheriff had said something about how [MASK] had kept it unchanged since his mother’s death.
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	And now he could sleep. There was no trick to it at all. You merely went into the roaring, and then past the roaring. Then everything was silent. Sleep, silent sleep. [MASK] came to with a start, jerking his head back.
<name>John</name>	John	Lila	“And that’s when he dug her up?” [MASK] frowned. “Apparently he did so, within a few months at most. He had this taxidermy hobby, and knew what he’d have to do.” “But I don’t understand.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Sam	I thought I’d sneak through a call while he’s gone. So you stick around until I’m finished here. Oh-oh, he’s coming back. See you.” The receiver clicked and the line went dead. [MASK] hung up.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Sam	“Come on.” The big man ploughed out into the rain. [MASK] followed him, scrambling along the slippery walk, panting as they began the ascent of the steep slope leading to the house beyond. “Are you sure?”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Sam	In a way I can almost understand. We’re all not quite as sane as we pretend to be.” [MASK] rose, and she walked him to the door. “Anyway, it’s over, and I’m going to try to forget it.
<name>He</name>	He	Sam	he was asking. “Just about to pour a little one for myself when you came in.” [MASK] hesitated. “Well----” “Find you a glass. There’s one under here someplace.” He bent behind the counter, emerged holding a shot-glass.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Lila	And nothing more. [MASK] started over to examine the dresser and vanity, then halted beside the bed. The hand-embroidered bedspread was very lovely; she put out a hand to feel the texture, then drew it back hastily.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Norman	All he needed. Just knowing she was here, beside him, as he went to sleep. [MASK] stirred, turned, and then fell into a darkness deeper and more engulfing than the swamp. 6 Promptly at six o’clock on the following Friday evening, a miracle happened.
<name>Lois</name>	Lois	Sam	And that’s why we haven’t gotten any word.” “[MASK], I can’t take much more of this. I’ve got to know!” “You’ve got to eat, too.” He displayed a bulging paper bag.
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	He told her to go back to her room, and not to show herself at the window, just lie down until he got there. And he had locked the door. But he’d have to unlock it now. [MASK] closed the office and went outside.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Mary	A single lamp shone from the unshaded parlor window, but a brighter reflection blazed from upstairs. If his mother was ill, that’s where she’d be. [MASK] stood there, waiting for a response, but nothing happened. Maybe he was upstairs, too.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	She could even be----” “All right! You don’t have to tell me my business, [MASK]. Come on, let’s go over to the office and I’ll let her sign. But if you ask me, it’s a waste of time.
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	If not, the other one would be around here somewhere. [MASK] was bleary-eyed and weary, but he searched. It wasn’t anywhere in the room, so it must either be in her baggage or still attached to her ear.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Arbogast	“That’s about enough!” he said. “You have no official right to make such accusations. So far you haven’t offered one word of proof to back up any of this.” [MASK] fumbled for another cigarette. “You want proof, eh?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Arbogast	He stood up, swinging his arms. “I don’t know why [MASK] hasn’t called in by now. There aren’t that many places in this area to check, not if he stopped at every highway hamburger joint and motel in the county!
<name>He</name>	He	Mary	Suppose she reacted as [MASK] had anticipated—came to her without going to the police, even consented to remain silent in the future because of a sense of obligation. The fact remained that she’d know. And there’d be complications.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Sam	‘With all my love—[MASK]. ’ Easy enough to figure out the connection. So I decided to put myself in your sister’s place. I’ve just laid my hands on forty thousand dollars in cash. I’ve got to get out of town, fast.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	The money wouldn’t help her and [MASK] wouldn’t help her, because she’d taken the wrong turn back there and she was on a strange road. But no help for it—she’d made her grave now and now she must lie in it.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Norman	There were times when you wanted to pass out. [MASK] remembered to pull down the Venetian blinds and switch off the sign outside. There, that did it. Closed for the night. Nobody would notice the dim light of the desk lamp now that the blinds were down.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Summerfield	It wasn’t easy, living like this. But it was the only way. She understood, she agreed to wait. Maybe he ought to take a few days off next week, leave [MASK] in charge here, and take a run down to see her.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Snakes	The music was descending now, spiraling to a minor key. This must be the theme for the snake garden. Yes, he recognized it, with its slithering strings, its writhing woodwinds squirming over the sluggish bass. [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Arbogast	If [MASK] wanted to lie, why should he lie about a thing like that?” “I don’t know. Maybe it was just the first thing he----” “In fact, if he was planning to run off, then why did he bother to call up at all?
<name>He</name>	He	Sam	“That’s all right.” Her voice was different, too; softer and lower. “Come inside, won’t you?” “Well—” She hesitated, glancing down at her feet, and then [MASK] noticed the small suitcase on the sidewalk.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	Talk about not knowing other people—why, when you came right down to it, you didn’t even know yourself! He’d never suspected that he could entertain such sudden doubt and disloyalty concerning [MASK]. And yet how easily he’d slipped into accepting the attitude!
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Arbogast	“Sure, right away. He says it’s a lie—[MASK] never even mentioned seeing anyone. I talked kind of rough to him at first, on purpose, just to see if there was something he was holding back on, but his story makes sense.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Wright	That was another lie. [MASK] was wrong. Filthy, stupid liars! They thought they were so clever, coming in here and trying to pull their tricks on him. Well, they’d see! The girl was staring at the register now.
<name>He</name>	He	Norman	Maybe she’d gone down past the woods back of the house, along the narrow ten-acre strip of their land which stretched off into the swamp. Wouldn’t it be better to search for her first? [MASK] sighed and shook his head.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Hamlet	There was the ghost of [MASK]’s father, for example. No time to think about that now. He had to get down to the motel and open up. There’d been some business during the week, not very much.
<name>David</name>	David	Norman	He remembered the way the car had gone down, disappearing in the quicksand. [MASK] knew he wasn’t thinking clearly any more. He was faintly aware of the fact that he was lying on the bed, had been lying on the bed for a long time now.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Sam	[MASK], I want to know\” She smoothed her blouse again, but her brow remained wrinkled. “You aren’t fooling me for one minute, with all this routine about nails. You’re just as nervous as I am. Aren’t you?”
<name>They</name>	They	Chances	[MASK] were, she didn’t like this kind of music, either. Sometimes he almost wondered if they hadn’t made a mistake when they planned ahead. After all, what did they really know about each other?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lila	15 [MASK] went up the steps, reaching the porch just before the rain came. The house was old, its frame siding gray and ugly here in the half-light of the coming storm. Porch boards creaked under her feet, and she could hear the wind rattling the casements of the upstairs windows.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Sam	The fat man paused. “No, I waited until I saw her drive up the road. I waited until I saw her stop.” “Stop?” [MASK] tried to find the face in the darkness, but all he could hear was the voice.
<name>he</name>	he	Norman	Why had he said there hadn’t been anyone here? The man was describing that girl all right, he knew all about her. Well, he still couldn’t prove the girl had come, if [MASK] denied it. And he’d have to keep on denying, now.
<name>Walters</name>	Walters	Lowery	“I know how you feel, but you can’t make him your patsy. Unless the thief is found, tried and convicted, our company doesn’t pay off—and [MASK] is out of the forty grand. So he couldn’t profit from the deal in any way.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bates	[MASK]’s bedroom—singularly small, singularly cramped, with a low cot more suitable for a little boy than a grown man. Probably he’d always slept here, ever since he was a child. The bed itself was rumpled and showed signs of recent occupancy.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	And yet, just how much did he know about [MASK], really? Just last night he’d acknowledged to himself how little he actually understood his fiancee. Why, he knew so little that he’d even mistaken another girl for her, in a dim light.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sam	One thing was certain, she was through depending on others—others who didn’t care, who just wanted to keep out of trouble. She didn’t trust [MASK] to stick his neck out any more, and she certainly didn’t trust the Sheriff.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Norman	“Oh.” [MASK] was a little more relieved. For a moment he’d been afraid it was something serious, that the girl was missing or wanted for some major offense. In that case, there’d be a real investigation.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	But somebody had been sleeping, somebody had been staring out of the window. And if it had been [MASK], where was she now? She could ransack the rest of the room, go through the drawers, search downstairs. But that wasn’t important at the moment.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Arbogast	“You’ll find I haven’t had any long-distance calls for a month.” [MASK] nodded. “So she didn’t phone you. She drove straight up, told you what had happened, and made a date to meet you later, after things cooled down.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sam	As they turned down the side street it was apparent that the services had just ended; people were beginning to emerge from the steepled structure. “There he is,” [MASK] muttered. “Come on.” He led her over to a couple who stood near the curbing.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mary	“But what would she be doing here?” “I was hoping you could tell me that.” “But how could I? [MASK] isn’t here.” “ Was she here? Earlier this week, I mean?” “Of course not.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	He really didn’t know very much about [MASK], when he came right down to it. In a way, her sister seemed more familiar. A nice girl, but too hair-triggered, too impulsive. Always making snap judgments and decisions.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Norman	There was a rutted path here, worn by tire tracks, and he found it. Every few months [MASK] took his own car along this route, hitching up the trailer and going into the woods bordering the swamp to collect firewood for the kitchen.
<name>he</name>	he	Bates	There was a small mirror, flawed and flecked, over the washbowl, but no medicine cabinet behind it. Here was the linen closet, stacked with towels and bedding. She rummaged through the shelves hastily; their contents told her nothing except that [MASK] probably had his laundry sent out.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Norman	Now he’d know. He did know! [MASK] could tell it when the detective raised his head and stared at him. Here, close up, he could see beneath the shadow cast by the hat brim. He could see the cold eyes, the eyes that knew.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Norman	And the important thing to remember was that [MASK] had fooled the Sheriff the first time, when everything had been much harder. This time it should be even easier, if he remembered to be calm. It should be, and it was.
<name>He</name>	He	Sam	But he was beginning to make a federal case out of it, [MASK] told himself wryly. Or a clinical case. If he was going off on such far-fetched speculations, he’d have to admit a thousand and one other alternatives.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	He was holding the earring under the light now, staring at it as she spoke. “She must have knocked it off when she was taking her shower and it fell over in back of the stall. Unless something else happ---[MASK], what’s the matter?”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Bates	“And you run the whole place by yourself?” “That’s right.” [MASK] moved around the counter, carrying the bottle. “Here, let me fill your glass.” “I really shouldn’t.” “Won’t hurt you.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Arbogast	You’ve got nothing to go by except what this man Bates said over the phone just now. Couldn’t he be lying?” “Why should he? He told a straight story. Said the girl had been there, said [MASK] was there.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Norman	Cigarette butts on the edge of the washbowl, and a magazine on the floor next to the toilet seat. One of those science fiction things. [MASK] chuckled as he picked it up. Science fiction! If they only knew\ But they didn’t know.
