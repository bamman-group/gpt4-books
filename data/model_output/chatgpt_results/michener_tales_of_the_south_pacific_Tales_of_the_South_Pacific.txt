<name>Lieutenant</name>	Lieutenant	Oscar	“You can’t fool around in here,” he whined. “The lieutenant brought us some food!” one of the older nurses said. “He ain’t got no right in here,” the attendant replied. “Look, [MASK]!”
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Sage	“He says a gentleman never argues except on one question: ‘Who picks up the check?’ Then it’s perfectly legitimate for you to argue that it’s the other fellow’s turn. [MASK] advice, that.”
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Pearlstein	[MASK] returned to the map. “Can you think of anyone who might know about that bend?” he asked. “You can see how urgent it is that we satisfy our minds as to that ravine.” The Australians wrinkled their brows.
<name>I</name>	I	Benoway	It was a horrible fantasy which ended only when our magnificent pilot pulled us up at the last moment and skidded the plane along the tips of the waves andfinally into a trough that stopped our flight. (“Heavens,” [MASK] thought.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Denis	Old men? Or were those who lived committed to a double burden? Theirs and the dead men’s? From the picket fence I heard a cheerful voice. It was [MASK] lugging a bucket of cold water. He laughed when he saw me by the graves.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Mary	There was a slight revulsion in his voice and manner as he answered her. “I can’t,” he said. [MASK] dropped her pretense of pleasantness at this, insulted by the slight and infuriated that her plans might go awry. “Why not?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nothin’	“What’s up! What’s happened?” “[MASK],” the ambulance driver replied. “I just want to get rid of this damned washing machine and get back to the hospital.” He jumped out of the ambulance and threw the doors open.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Paul	What the hell has passion to do with life on this rock?” His revery was interrupted by a knock at the door of his hut. “May I come in?” a cheery voice inquired. [MASK] peered into the darkness toward the insomniac ocean.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Grant	No one was hungry, but we were terribly nervous. As night wore on, we gave up trying to work the radio. We had long since surrendered it to [MASK], who sat hunched by it, his hands covering his face, listening to whatever station he could get.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cable	Eagerly he sought for them, and in a moment he had drawn the white smock over her head. In rare beauty she stood proudly against the wall, naked to the waist, incredibly feminine. It was then that she spoke to [MASK], in French.
<name>Major</name>	Major	Charlesworth	If I want any of you PT heroes in here I’ll let you know.” [MASK], who was already irritated at having a mere lieutenant, a nobody and a reserve at that, listed as a V.I.P., snapped to attention.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Latouche	She smiled, a Javanese sort of smile. “I like men,” she said. “American men I like very much. Is no good men by themselves all the time.” I understand not less than six marriages resulted from [MASK]’s dinners.
<name>Zampanò</name>	Zampanò	Bus	In a nice way, you understand. Nothing rough! At other times she was mystical and brooding, silent as a cat. She got these things from her Buddhist mother. I met her, said [MASK], in the damnedest way.
<name>Isaac</name>	Isaac	Tony	[MASK], my brother, died with his jaws tied shut with bands of iron. He could only speak through his teeth.” The old woman dropped her head on her hands. The lamp threw an eerie glow upon her white hair.
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Bill	arms. Feverishly, as if this were the ultimate expression of what he had been storing up in his heart, he copied the last two pages of [MASK]’s letter. His pen scrawled on, I love you, I love you, Oh my darling.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ever’body	Finer man never lived this side o’ heaven. [MASK] says that. You know de commander?” I replied that I had. The Negro droned on. “He about de bes’ man I met in all de Navy.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Cable	They cleared it with the patrol craft. They could drop you off.” He paused archly. “That is, if you wished to go . . .” His voice trailed off in fine southern insinuation. [MASK] was perplexed for a moment.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Joe	Did it mean you couldn’t ever have any babies? Or did it mean something worse? With wonderful funds of ignorance and superstition [MASK] and his friends considered the question from all angles. They found no answer to their informer’s devastating insinuation: “All right!
<name>Spider</name>	Spider	Nellie	“Oh! Well! Why didn’t you say so?” the driver asked in a most cooperative spirit. “In a real emergency I always do 26.” [MASK] winced as they passed the place where four men had jumped on the car earlier that night.
<name>Ondonga</name>	Ondonga	Delicately	Lovingly the tusks were appraised, but when the double-circle ones were reached the men sat in silent admiration. Such tusks might never again be seen in their declining lifetimes. [MASK] the chief who had dispensed this largess picked up the jawbone with the sacred tusks.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Harbison	“May I come in?” the lieutenant called cheerily from the darkness. “Glad you’re back,” laughed the doctor, pouring them both a shot of whiskey. “Judging from your tone, you’ve finished the letter,” [MASK] observed.
<name>boss</name>	boss	Hewitt	he protested. “I know it is, [MASK], and that’s what I wanted to ask you about.” “What’s wrong with it? It’s to my wife. I didn’t say nothing about no ships or nothing.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nancy	Once we had a bad time of it when the raft started to ship water, and I prayed pretty furiously, and you were all mixed up in the prayers. I don’t want you to worry about anything, [MASK], for I am all right.
<name>Mr. Bennet</name>	Mr. Bennet	Dinah	I’ve got to tell him, tonight!” She hurried about the room getting her clothes together. “Oh, [MASK]!” she chortled. “Think what it will be like! A big family in a big house! Eight daughters, and they’re darlings.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Joe	His wife had a baby after he was overseas sixteen months, but he agreed to the divorce and she married the other man. The yeoman took it OK. [MASK] knew him well, and then seven months after it was all over he strung himself up.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Burke	“He didn’t do so bad gettin’ us on this beach, did he?” “Yeah, but look how he done it. A slaughter!” “You just said it was easier than you expected.” “I was thinkin’ of over there,” [MASK] said.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Tony	“What’s that?” I cried. “Part of a series of stables,” [MASK] replied. “The convicts were building it for the governor’s horses when the lid blew off the island.” I looked at the fantastic stables.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Nellie	Besides her was a strong, tough man. It was someone like him she had in mind when she said long ago, “I want to get out and meet people.” It was not old ladies in white lace sitting by the fireside that [MASK] wanted to meet.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Bill	If it were not for sports [MASK] might have lost his sanity. But on the diamond or basketball court he was superb. Enlisted men loved to watch him play or to play with him. They put two men on him in basketball, and still he scored almost at will.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Japoni	He turned his back on the barrow and studied the ants at their work. “We’ll bury the guy,” he said. Immediately the native started to wail. “[MASK] say he killim all fella b’long village we stop ’im ’long ground.
<name>me</name> (or any other name, as there is no specific name given in the passage)	me (or any other name, as there is no specific name given in the passage)	Pearlstein	I made proper inquiries among the air experts and was told that if no longer strip was humanly possible, 5,000 would have to do. But an extra thousand feet would save the lives of at least fifteen pilots. I reported this fact. Everyone looked at [MASK].
<name>Hezekiah</name>	Hezekiah	Joe	Before [MASK] got wise, he had a case of prickly heat. One morning he woke up just as usual, but soon after he put on his shirt he felt somebody stick a handful of pins in his back. Right between his shoulder blades.
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Grant	Our forces are regrouping.” At that last admission everyone in the room cheered. It was then that [MASK] rose to his feet. He started to speak. Surprised, we stopped to listen. We knew he was drunk, but not how drunk.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Billis	“In ship.” “Well, go get from ship!” [MASK] cried, slapping the old man on the back. The natives laughed. The old fellow went to the shore, waded in and started swimming toward a ship anchored in the bay.
<name>David</name>	David	Cable	[MASK] went to the shower and washed off his face and hands. He was frightened, even when he knew what the object was. He was frightened because he had slept so restlessly, because he had awakened so bizarrely, because he had been reprimanded that morning.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Latouche	That she was an evil devil. But the old fellow was deranged. That’s clear from what happened a few days later when he heard that [MASK] had been released. The old man backed up and dashed himself against the wall four times until he broke his neck.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	One morning he woke up just as usual, but soon after he put on his shirt he felt somebody stick a handful of pins in his back. Right between his shoulder blades. He jumped and looked around. “Whassa matter, [MASK]?”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Fry	[MASK], who was learning the language, replied sagely. The drum beat on. The tinkling bell haunted my ears when I became aware of a disturbance behind me. Suddenly there was shouting in Javanese and then bold words in French.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Denis	He waved his hand once more across the graves. I waited for him to speak again. “Up here,” he continued, “dey is only heroes. Me ’n’ [MASK] has often remarked dat never again will we be surrounded only by heroes.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Cable	“But dinner! It is down there. In my hut. It’s all ready!” she insisted with some show of fury. “It’s waiting. I made it myself.” “When could you have made dinner?” [MASK] asked.
<name>The Sergeant</name>	The Sergeant	Tony	[MASK] replied. “You’ll be sorry!” the Marine cried mournfully. But we weren’t. We all went to sleep and had a good night’s rest. It was not until nine o’clock next morning that we were sorry. “My God!”
<name>Adeline</name>	Adeline	Tony	To my dismay, [MASK] was with her. “A surprise!” she said. There, ahead of us, in a hollow square formed by two huts, the shed, and a bamboo screen, the local Buddhists had set up a temple.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Bowl	“What better can I do with it? Shoot craps? Play poker with you sharks? Hell, no! Now I really got me something. Know what I’m going to do with it?” “[MASK]?” an irreverent Marine asked. “No!
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Harbison	She was physically ill for three days. Then, in a flash, word came that all but one of the men had been found on a life raft. They were knocked about, but they would be all right. [MASK] was saved.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Latouche	You don’t sound the final ps, and she can really sing. The last record was for [MASK]. Then I kissed her, and she closed her eyes, and I could feel her shivering, but not from love.
<name>Wilson</name>	Wilson	Joe	His first order was that each man must sleep under mosquito nets at all times. He almost had a mutiny on his hands, and the ringleader was [MASK]. The huts in which enlisted men slept were foul things. Quonsets for eight men housed twenty-four.
<name>Arkansas</name>	Arkansas	Nellie	He knew something of its mores and shibboleths. And yet [MASK] was correct in assuming that no Frenchman could understand why, to an Arkansas girl, a man who had openly lived with a nigger was beyond the pale. Utterly beyond the bounds of decency!
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Fry	“Yeah, it takes about seven years to grow a good tusk. It begins to enter the face about the fourth year. This here pig lived about five years after the tusks started through the bone.” “How horrible!” [MASK] said.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Tony	“You’ll be sorry!” the Marine cried mournfully. But we weren’t. We all went to sleep and had a good night’s rest. It was not until nine o’clock next morning that we were sorry. “My God!” [MASK] groaned.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Joe	Where he got his equipment no one knew. He had a big deal of some kind on the fire. They all knew that. “It’ll be ten dollars,” the photographer growled. “You get two prints and the negative.” [MASK] whistled.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Fry	He said, “When [MASK] broke into my shack I didn’t know what to think. He was like a madman. But as I listened to him I said, ‘This boy’s talking my language.’ A brave man was in trouble.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Polikopf	He laughed about [MASK] at breakfast while the captain was thinking. “You know,” the insolent pilot said, “I don’t see what we can try the boy for.” “Don’t call him a boy!”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Benoway	Now they dug at the bloody earth into which they were tossed by excited chiefs who chanted new songs and hauled new pigs to the slaughter. After the fifth pig was killed in this shuddery manner, [MASK] found that he had to look away.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tony	To overflowing. This is it.” “If you try to take her back to the States, [MASK]! Everyone will think she’s a Jap.” “I won’t,” he replied. “And maybe I won’t go back to the States.
<name>Crusoe</name>	Crusoe	Tony	Without thinking, he placed his right foot on the barrow, too, and talked earnestly with the crippled native. All that steaming midday, with the sun blazing overhead, [MASK] asked questions, questions, and got back fragments of answers in Pidgin.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Bill	It meant that her man was on his way to sea. It meant their wonderful days were over. Sadly she packed her things and waited in her sunny rooms for [MASK] to come back after the end-of-term review.
<name>Ricketts</name>	Ricketts	Tony	Maybe life here is what I’ve been looking for. This Pacific will be the center of the new world. This is our future. Well, I’m part of it. This is for me.” “[MASK], you’re forcing me,” I said.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Fry	We became utterly convinced that under similar circumstances we ordinary people would have to act in the same way. [MASK] might ask, “What makes him do that?” but we knew there was a deeper question haunting each of us. And we would look at one another.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joe	He showed her picture to several of his friends. You couldn’t see much of her face, but what there was looked mighty neat and clean. [MASK] felt fine. Then one day he got a brief letter.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cable	What happened next they did not fully anticipate. Instead of drowsily opening his eyes at the noise [MASK], for some unknown reason, sat bolt upright. As he did so, his steaming face hit the object which he was supposed to have seen upon waking.
<name>Madame Butterfly</name>	Madame Butterfly	Latouche	I thought my arm was broken. Seeing this, [MASK] screamed and rushed from the enclosure. Her flowing gown caught in the bamboo screen and pulled it down. Her flying skirt flashing in the candlelight, she rushed up the hill toward the safety of her white house.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Hoag	“It was not far from a bay.” [MASK] stepped aside as the three middle-aged people tried to recall even the slightest certainty about the far and unhappy chapter of their lives. No agreement was reached. No agreement could be reached.
<name>Captain Ahab</name>	Captain Ahab	Hoag	On the other hand, his social position in civilian life was such that he had acquired those graces of behavior which mark the true naval officer and distinguish him from men of the other services. [MASK]’s men idolized him and told all sorts of silly stories about things he had done.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Joe	“I don’t want no trouble!” “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” the Skipper shouted. “You think you can get away with murder around here?” He looked up at the frightened seaman. [MASK] licked his lips.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Fat	“[MASK]’s in the fire!” an Australian cried. We hurried across the field to where the explosion had taken place. We found one of the smaller bulldozers blown to bits. Dynamite. “Those dirty bastards!” an Army engineer said.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Nellie	With great relief and yet with some regrets, [MASK] recovered her determination and hastily dressed. She sat in the jeep with her head in her hands. Her short hair, attractive and brown, fell in cascades over her fingers. Her world was in turmoil.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Liat	There were no heads, and this fact so roused his uncertain spirits that when the boat cleared the headland he threw caution away and made frantic gestures to [MASK]. “There,” he pointed. “There. At the bottom of the cliff!”
<name>Nimitz</name>	Nimitz	Grant	You have a feeling he’ll get you back.” [MASK], in the meantime, sat apart and studied the map. With a thin forefinger he charted the course of the gathering Jap fleet. Inevitably the lines converged on the New Hebrides . . .
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Benny	And the Tonk would grin sheepishly, lick his beteled teeth, take another drink of water, and swallow the tablets. “Wait a minute!” [MASK] would bellow. Into the man’s mouth once more would go the searching finger. “Good fellow!”
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nellie	Other nurses, catching the story by grapevine, spent the night telling one another what a rotten break it was that [MASK] . . . They were somewhat disappointed when she appeared at breakfast bright and chipper. She hadn’t yet made up her mind to be heartbroken.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Billis	You have a big deal on?” “The sacred ceremonial, sir. I’ve been invited. You know the damned Navy. Can’t see its way clear to letting me go.” “What’s all this about, [MASK]? A sacred ceremonial?”
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Fry	Where do you find these things out?” “Oh,” the SeaBee replied, “I’m sort of like you. I like to know things.” [MASK] looked at him sideways. He wondered if the fat fellow were pulling his leg.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Pearlstein	All we’ll have to do is bulldoze the coral over here. We won’t move the shovel again. Let’s see what we can do!” I left [MASK], bare to the waist, high up the boom of the shovel, loosening some bolts.
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Vanicoro	As he did so, his steaming face hit the object which he was supposed to have seen upon waking. It was the grisly head from [MASK]! It was hanging by the hair. The force with which his face hit the grim object caused it to swing in a long arc.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hewitt	That is, information of any kind.” “Oh, sir, I’d never do that. No, sir.” “I’ll trust you, [MASK]. But I may censor one now and then to make sure.” There was a long moment of silence.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Marthe	[MASK] was only fifteen when I first saw her. She was the queen of the group. Having lived among older men from the beginning of the war, she had acquired some damned cute little ways. She knew this and kept her soft almond eye directed down toward her plate.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Tony	There was a long silence and then [MASK]’s languid voice: “All but the starboard!” he said. “And the port is dragging, too!” “Well, anyway, we’re up!”
<name>Atabrine</name>	Atabrine	Benny	It was clear that she liked [MASK]. As soon as she reached the jeep, she darted her strong small hand in, grabbed the atabrine bottle, popped three pills into her mouth, chewed them up, taste and all, and swallowed them without water.
<name>the soldiers</name>	the soldiers	Americans	“Hello, hello!” he cried, waving his atabrine bottle. “Here comes the doctor!” In his exuberance, in the tireless, sweaty, steaming friendliness and at-homeness of the man everyone could see why [MASK] were the way they were.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Man	I can’t say he left us, though, for his fixation on the Remittance [MASK] remained. We used to say, “Who do you suppose that guy actually was?” We never found out. We found no shred of evidence that pointed to anything but a thoroughly prosaic Englishman.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Eddie	His voice was not heard above the noise of vigorous side arguments. “He says No,” [MASK] reported loudly. “And you men are damned right. Very few self-respecting American men would attempt to knock off a piece of jungle julep.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Tony	“They’ll be coming down some night.” To my surprise he led me to the cave. At the entrance we could hear excited voices of young PT skippers. They were telling [MASK] of the air battles they had watched. We stepped into the cave.
<name>General</name>	General	Hoag	[MASK] turned and faced his officers. “There is a considerable gully there. Don’t call it a ravine. We assume this hill is coral. Probably three feet of loam over it. All right. We're taking chances. We lost on one and gained on the other.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Dinah	I think I know all of what you mean. Thanks for talking.” The handsomely built young girl folded her nightgown about her thin waist and left. [MASK] watched her go. “She thinks I’m jealous of her,” the older woman mused.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joe	They kidded him a lot, and that evening an older man who knew a thing or two about sailors came by and asked if he could see the picture again. [MASK] practically fell over himself to think that anyone had remembered her.
<name>Private</name>	Private	Cable	The young Marine reported and saluted stiffly. “[MASK],” the older man began brusquely, “your work has been going down badly. What’s happening? Are you in trouble of any kind?” “No, sir!”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Emile	I have not told you, but I have a lot of money saved.” At the thought of having saved things over the years [MASK] grew pensive. Outside the birds called to one another and the golden ca-caos reflected sunlight from their myriad facets.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Joe	He wanted to talk to somebody about it, but he had noticed that whenever you got started on something like that, you got into trouble. Bad trouble. Two months before, [MASK] was lying in his bunk. It was about eleven-thirty at night.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Tony	Well, that boar ennobled the life of an entire village.” “And the boar himself?” the sallow officer asked. “Friend,” [MASK] said. “I’m going to say a pretty harsh thing. Now please don’t get mad at me.
<name>Dr. Adams</name>	Dr. Adams	Bill	He was a delightful man for such an affair, and he bore himself with distinction. The steaks were good. One doctor had three. [MASK] ate sparingly of one choice filet. A young nurse prepared it for him, and he thanked her graciously.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Fry	One he gave to [MASK], one to the chaplain. He smiled at them and then nodded. They must go. Soon there would be dancing and feasting and love-making. That was a private affair. Down the long trail to the ocean they went.
<name>Tonks</name>	Tonks	Mary	[MASK] listened attentively, for like most Tonks, she knew French fairly well. The lieutenant was pleased that she followed his words and that she apparently understood that she must stop selling grass skirts not only at the kiosk but everywhere else as well.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cable	“How much?” she asked. “Take it!” [MASK] cried in disgust. “Me take?” the old woman asked, uncertain that he was actually giving her this prize. “Take it and get out!” he cried impatiently.
<name>Goody</name>	Goody	Bus	He looked at the burred wheel hubs and the slashed rubber. He looked back at the scraper, whose driver had passed out cold, grazed by a TBF tail wheel. Then he grinned at [MASK]. “Best landing you ever made,” he said.
<name>The Old Man</name>	The Old Man	Cable	Native girls looked at him and wondered if they had looked so frightened once. Little boys started yelling at him in island tongues he could not understand, and [MASK] waited in the boat. With steady stroke the man approached.
<name>MacPherson</name>	MacPherson	Lucy	[MASK] was crawling over the seats to the front of the jeep. “This will do me,” I said. “I’d have you up to my diggings,” he continued. “But it would be embarrassing. It would be terribly embarrassing to you.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Latouche	A Spanish girl sang it. In the third act, I think, this Spanish girl is trying to meet a soldier in a snowstorm. I told [MASK] about it, and the little guard house. She rose on one elbow.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bill	She did not bathe. She dived into the ocean and swam with long easy strokes to the raft. Perched upon the boards, she shook her bobbed hair free of water and laughed. “Some difference,” [MASK] thought.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cable	And [MASK] was around a good deal. He used to drop by in the hot afternoons. Even the flies would be asleep, and cattle would be in the shade. No birds would sing, and from the cacao trees no lorikeets would fly.
<name>Zarathustra</name>	Zarathustra	Latouche	Like children lost in a dream of Christmas they wandered about the gardens and the beaches. I came upon them one day, far below on the white coral. [MASK] wore nothing, simply that golden body slim and twisting in the shallow water.
