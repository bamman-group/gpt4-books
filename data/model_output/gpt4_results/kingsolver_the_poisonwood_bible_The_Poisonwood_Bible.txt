<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Adah	It was the only time she ever stopped rolling her eyes and flicking her hair, to settle down to a piece of honest work. [MASK] and I dragged our sewing projects out to the porch so we could still keep an eye out for interesting goings-on in the world.
<name>Arjun</name>	Arjun	Nathan	It’s not our headache, he said. Let them go Communist if they feel like it. It was beyond me to weigh such matters, when my doorstep harbored snakes that could knock a child dead by spitting in her eyes. But [MASK] wouldn’t hear my worries.
<name>Yahweh</name>	Yahweh	Susanna	and I realized this slick trick schoolteacher could be saying anything under the sun. Our father would never be the wiser. So they stoned the dame and married two more wives apiece and lived happily ever after. I yawned, uninspired yet again by the pious and beautiful [MASK].
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Methuselah	Down in the damp grass I saw the red shaft of another one, and I reached for it. Following the trail I found first the red and then the gray: clusters of long wing feathers still attached to gristle and skin, splayed like fingers. Downy pale breast feathers in tufted mounds. [MASK].
<name>Anatole</name>	Anatole	Anatole	“He’s not here. I can tell him whatever it is, though.” I wondered if [MASK] would consider me a sufficient messenger. I’d noticed Congolese men didn’t treat even their own wives and daughters as if they were very sensible or important.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Anatole	“I will tell you someday.” If I never learned my French conjugations from [MASK], at least I would try to learn patience. “Can I ask you something else?” He considered this request, his left hand still holding his place in his book.
<name>Ortega</name>	Ortega	Lumumba	With all his minerals. Some of your countrymen have given a lot of encouragement to his decision.” “Why can’t they just make their deals with [MASK]? He’s the one that got elected. They ought to know that.” “They know.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	These four have not been together in one place since the death of the other. They have come here to say good-bye to [MASK] May or so they claim. They wish to find her grave. But in truth they are saying goodbye to their mother.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Mothers	He was to be given his meals, the privilege of sleeping in our chicken house (where a handful of wary hens had crept back home, after hiding from [MASK] killing spree for the picnic), and a basket of eggs to sell each week so he could start saving up for a wife.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Adah	“How can you possibly say that? You haven’t set foot there for half your life!” “I have retained my citizenship. I still put up the American flag in the bar and celebrate every single Fourth of July.” “Impressive,” [MASK] said.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Pharaoh	And your father is giving a sermon about [MASK]’s army and the plagues. Everyone is all right.” I squatted low with my chin on my knees and watched my bare feet change slowly from dark auburn, to speckled, to white as the ants dispersed and forayed out into the bottom of the canoe.
<name>Yacob</name>	Yacob	Anatole	I was still mourning, he said, still sick, still living partly in another place. [MASK] is a patient farmer. He reminds me that our arrangement is not at all unusual; he’s known many men to take even ten-year-olds as brides.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Pauline	It flies around at night. [MASK] went to bed those nights begging her husband not to gnaw with his beak at the living. That’s what I beheve, anyway. I think she would have pled with him not to steal the souls of those who would take his place.
<name>Kvothe</name>	Kvothe	Anatole	I clasped the sack to my chest and looked up at [MASK] sideways. “Would you really have taken it back if I hadn’t guessed right?” He smiled. “I would have given you a lot of chances to guess right.”
<name>God</name>	God	Fate	[MASK] sentenced Our Father to pay for those lives with the remainder of his, and he has spent it posturing desperately beneath the eyes of a God who will not forgive a debt. This God worries me. Lately He has been looking in on me.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Pascal	It only dawned on me later, I should have told him “blonde.” Once we’d made friends, [MASK] borrowed a machete and cut sugarcane for me to chew on. With hard, frightening whacks he cut the cane into popsicle lengths before replacing the machete beside his father’s hammock.
<name>LeGuin</name>	LeGuin	Anatole	The kingdom was held together by thousands of miles of footpaths crossing the forest, with suspension bridges of woven vines swinging quiedy over the rivers. I picture it as [MASK] describes it: men and women in tiers of velvet skirts, walking noiselessly on a forest path.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rachel	First we had to pull down all the mosquito netting from the frame. Then with a grand heave-ho we shoved the bed away from the wall. What we saw on the wall behind it made us stare. “What are those?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Anatole	The plantation is mostly rubble. (I imagine it dismantled by the whacked-off ghost hands of all those rubber workers.) The one building left standing contains the very library where [MASK], as a young household servant, taught himself to read and write English.
<name>quick</name>	quick	Httle	Maybe too [MASK]. I said to him, “Where is all the green mamba snakes?” I know they live up in a tree so they can drop on you and kill you, and I wanted to see some.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Leah	Hadn’t there been, say, a rash of hurricanes in the months after [MASK] and I were born? A bad winter nationwide for the flu? Who knew. I shrugged, and drew a second giraffe with a dramatic, Z-shaped crook to its neck.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leah	She resembled a cross-eyed rabbit. At the mention of palm nuts she whined, “But, you all, on a diet of just fruit we could plumb die or even get diarrhea.” “Well, what else is free?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Anatole	And you. All the girls my age have their own babies and are too busy. And the men act like I’m a snake fixing to bite them.” He shook his head, laughing. “They do so, [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Axelroot	We girls stick together like birds of a feather, and thank goodness for that, because the men are always off on one kind of business or another. In [MASK]’s case, as I have mentioned, it frequently turns out to be monkey business.
<name>Linus</name>	Linus	Pascal	he would ask me by way of greeting. “What are we doing?” It was a good question. Our companionship consisted mainly of [MASK] telling me the names for everything we saw and some things I hadn’t thought to look for.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Axelroot	“Well, well.” He was smiling, and ran the back of his hand along the side of my face. “I’d expect more modesty from a preacher’s daughter.” “I’ll show you preacher’s daughter. Go to hell, [MASK]!”
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Nelson	[MASK] opened it up and took out something, I couldn’t tell what. It looked like a piece of chicken bone with gristle and string all on it and sticky and something black. What was it, something that died? I was scared and started fixing to cry.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Scraping	[MASK] fiercely for food and shelter, mad entirely for love, by definition. My boys all cry “Sola mbote!” as they run out the door, away from my shelter and advice but never escaping my love.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Fie	[MASK] always said, “Girls, you choose your path and stick to it and suffer your consequences!” Well. If he’s finally dead now and laid to rest in some African voodoo cemetery, or worse yet eaten up by the wild animals, well, amen.
<name>John</name>	John	Nelson	He says some of them are saying to bury rocks in your garden right now, and after the white people are all dead, dig them up and those rocks will be turned into gold. [MASK] said he didn’t believe that.
<name>Kabila</name>	Kabila	Anatole	It occurred to me that I feared [MASK]’s anger more than anything. “Things are not so simple as you think,” he finally said, sounding neither angry nor especially kind. “This is not a time to explain the history of Congolese revolutionary movements.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leah	I asked. “The take-home lesson?” “The closing statement of the Old Testament: ‘So this will be the end.’” “So this will be the end,” [MASK] and I both repeated, in complete amazement.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Rachel	We wore our best dresses on the outside to make a good impression. [MASK] wore her green linen Easter suit she was so vain of, and her long whitish hair pulled off her forehead with a wide pink elastic hairband.
<name>June</name>	June	Ruth	But I won’t tell her. I prefer to remain anomalous. [MASK] May AT night the lizards run up the walls and upside down over the bed looking down at me. They stick up there with their toes.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Mobutu	, I think, is to outlive [MASK] and come back here when we can stand on this soil and say “home” without the taste of gold-leaf chandeliers and starvation burning bitter on the backs of our tongues.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Adah	Sometimes I write it this way without thinking, and people turn up startled. To them I am only [MASK] or, to my sisters sometimes, the drear monosyllabic Ade, lemonade, Band-Aid, frayed blockade, switchblade renegade, call a spade a spade.
<name>Yann</name>	Yann	Anatole	[MASK] says recurring dreams are common to those who’ve suffered seriously from malaria. When I’m nervous or sad I also fall prey to the awful itch from filaires, tiny parasites that crawl into your pores and cause a flare-up every so often.
<name>Corrine</name>	Corrine	Anatole	I stomped off to the kitchen house, where I could hear the rats already at the manioc, rewarding my spite. This is a day [MASK] and I simply have to get through. I’ve heard people say grief brings you closer, but the griefs he and I carry are so different.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Ruth	Father and [MASK] May both, as simple as that. My mind ached like a broken bone as I struggled to stand in the new place I found myself. I wouldn’t see my baby sister again, this I knew. But I hadn’t yet considered the loss of my father.
<name>Zainab</name>	Zainab	Leah	We never could see eye to eye on the business of having four wives. ...” “He has more than that now,” [MASK] tattled. “Aha. So you see, I was not a great influence in that department,” he said.
<name>Stalin</name>	Stalin	Mobutu	We tell our coworkers that a mere lack of funds mustn’t discourage our hopes. We know that to criticize [MASK], even in private, is to risk having your head cracked open like a nut, which naturally would discourage one’s hopes entirely.
<name>He</name>	He	Leah	It was already late afternoon, and I passed through spotted light, then brighter clearings, with grass so tall it bent from both sides to form a tunnel overhead, then back under trees again. [MASK] long gone ahead of me with the water.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Lumumba	“A bluff, exactly. I think [MASK] wants to be neutral, more than anything. More than he loves his very own life. He doesn’t want to give away our wealth, but he most especially does not want your country for an enemy.”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Anatole	That book was closed. Even my mother’s friends, who really did try, asked me nothing of [MASK]’s background or talents—only, in hushed tones when he left the room, “What happened to his face?”
<name>Adah</name>	Adah	Elevee	For what he teaches, for his belief in genuine independence, for his loyalty to the secret Parti Lumumbist Unifie, he could be brought down by one well-bribed informant. “The prisoners might make a lot of noise during the boxing match,” [MASK] suggested.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kilanga	The curtain of heat divided the will to survive from survival itself. I could have fallen trembling on the ground but stood and watched instead, watched [MASK]’s children shout and dance each time they found the scorched, angular bodies of a mother baboon and baby seared together.
<name>Lumumba</name>	Lumumba	Lumumba	In a democracy, [MASK] should have been allowed to live longer than two months as head of state. The Congolese people would have gotten to see how they liked him, and if not, replaced him.” Well, I just blew up at that.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	MamaTataba	My father mopped his brow again and launched into the parable of the one mustard seed falling on a barren place, and the other one on good soil. I thought of the bright pointy-nosed mustard bottles we used in abundance at church wiener suppers—a world apart from anything [MASK] had ever seen.
<name>Corrie</name>	Corrie	Anatole	Only when I tried to teach math, while [MASK] was working with the older students, did they raise pandemonium. “Okay, you’re right.They all hate me,” I whined. “I guess I’m not a good teacher.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nelson	I grabbed my mirror. Simply broke the frame [MASK] had made for it and tore it right down from the wall. Then I ran as fast as my legs would carry me. Out in the road it was a melee of shoving, strangers touching and shoving at me.
<name>Noah</name>	Noah	Noah	That particular combination stands as one chance in seven, by the way. It should occur on average seven times per year, separated by intervals just slightly longer than that endured by [MASK] on his putative ark. Was this blue-moon event special to our neighbors?
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Babe	When they finished with the thing, it lay there limp on the ground all shiny blue and red, covered with a slick white film. It looked like our old hound dog [MASK], except all made of grisde and blood.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nelson	Well, [MASK] says a lot of things. For example, if you run across two sticks in the shape of an X you have to hop over it backwards on your left foot. So we didn’t know whether to believe him about the disease.
<name>Kongo</name>	Kongo	Kikongo	There was no written language, but an oral tradition so ardent that when the Catholic fathers fixed letters to the words of [MASK], its poetry and stories poured into print with the force of a flood. The priests were dismayed to learn the Kongo already had their own Bible.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Hershey	He said he’d bring me cigarettes and [MASK]’s chocolate when he came back, and I was very thrilled at the time, I’m sure, but, jeez, oh man. Right now I’d settle for a good old-fashioned loaf of Wonder Bread.
<name>God</name>	God	Africa	[MASK] has slipped the floor out from under my righteous house, my Adah moral code. How sure I always felt before, how smug, moving through a world that desired to cast me into the den of earpulling Crawleys.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Robine	Whenever we are invited to the better homes for dinner, I just keep my eye on [MASK], because then you can’t go wrong. We girls stick together like birds of a feather, and thank goodness for that, because the men are always off on one kind of business or another.
<name>Kenge</name>	Kenge	Anatole	It is not the kind of thing you see very much of here in our village, but [MASK] is not from here. He is Congolese all right, but he has a different kind of eyes that slant a fit-de bit like a Siamese, only more intellectual.
<name>Tata</name>	Tata	Bangala	He throws back his head and shouts these words to the sky, while his lambs sit scratching themselves in wonder. [MASK] means something precious and dear. But the way he pronounces it, it means the poisonwood tree.
<name>Phoenix</name>	Phoenix	Tess	We squeaked by. We all lived upstairs. At one time there were eleven altogether, cousins from Noxubee County, uncles who came and went with the picking season, and my old Aunt [MASK]. She was a mother to me if I needed one.
<name>Unbelievable</name>	Unbelievable	Jeepers	Sometimes I do unladylike things like scratch myself and pretend I’m retarded. But I suppose he’d be just as happy to add a retarded wife to his collection; maybe he doesn’t have one yet. [MASK].The very fact my parents even let him in the door!
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Leah	“You’ve built the fire up way too hot,” I told her. “Go to hell, [MASK], just go straight, directly to hell.” “I’m just trying to help. Look, see how the metal’s glowing red hot on top?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Anatole	[MASK] seemed impressed. “Well, then, you can make up your own mind. What did you think of our Prime Minister?” It took me a moment s pause to discover what I thought. Finally I said, “I didn’t understand everything.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Nelson	“Well, I just don’t understand. You make it sound like she’s an accessory he needs to go with his outfit.” [MASK] paused for a long time to wipe the ash from his face and puzzle over the metaphor of accessories and outfits.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Nkisi	[MASK]. Sometimes I wake up and it is still there. If they come and try to make me go up on the roof naked I will just disappear, and turn up some whole other place. But first I have to think of where I will go.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Anatole	I’m pretty sure I was pregnant at Christmastime, but now I’m sure I’m not, so there must have been a loss in there, but it’s easier not to mention it to [MASK]. Easier not to count it, if that’s possible.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Nelson	“I’m sorry, [MASK],” I told him, “but we just don’t worship those gods.” To make our position perfectly clear I added, “Baka veh.” This means, “We don’t pay for that,” which is how you say that you don’t believe.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Nelson	[MASK] says every person in the village is to be there, required precipitation. Well, fine, I can go walk through a burnt field and get covered with soot from head to toe. I gave up long ago trying to pass the white-glove test.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Adah	Are they joking? [MASK] says no one is giving it any credence; here, no one has ever doubted it. It’s as if history can be no more than a mirror tipped up to show each of us exactly what we already knew.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ruth	If the mother and her children had not come down the path on this day, the pinched tree branches would have grown larger and the fat-bodied spider would have lived. Every fife is different because you passed this way and touched history. Even the child [MASK] May touched history.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Elisabet	Neither of us knew or cared if I was right. I’m learning that [MASK]’s sudden conversational turns are always for a good reason—usually someone’s safety, probably mine. I watch her in the marketplace, too, well aware that no schoolroom has ever taught me as much.
<name>Bidumuka</name>	Bidumuka	Nelson	That soap he uses for washing up and his clothes. All those smells were so loud in my ears. [MASK] is my friend that showed me how to sing to the chickens. Bidumuka is the magic name of a chicken.
<name>Yoyodyne</name>	Yoyodyne	Eugor	The radio a live mass of wire oozing from his trunk, a seething congregation of snakes. He speaks through the snakes and he speaks unutterable things. Names in code. Some I understand: [MASK], I-W, W-I Rogue.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Adah	It’s similar to the way [MASK] will sometimes turn up knowing some entire, difficult thing like French or the square root of pi when I’d been taking for granted I knew everything she did. After we first arrived, the children congregated outside our house each and every morning, which confused us.
<name>Nduka</name>	Nduka	Anatole	“If you are counting your enemies, you should not count me among them, sir,” [MASK] said. “And if you fear the rivals of your church, you should know there is another nganga here, another minister. People also put their trust in him.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Anatole	And an eligible bachelor at that, without three wives or even one as far as I know. [MASK], the schoolteacher, is twenty-four years of age, with all his fingers still on, both eyes and both feet, and that is the local idea of a top-throb dreamboat.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Nathan	I tried to laugh about it, for here we were: man and swollen wife and no more room at the inn. [MASK] did not laugh at that hopeful comparison. In fact, it brought his hand down against me for the first time.
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Anatole	But when those lucky few show up every morning, [MASK] lines them up, littlest to biggest. If ever you happen to be out and about in our village at the crack of dawn, as I try not to be, you can watch them do it.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Africa	I’ll live or die on the strength of your judgment, but first let me say who I am. Let me claim that [MASK] and I kept company for a while and then parted ways, as if we were both party to relations with a failed outcome.
<name>Gulliver</name>	Gulliver	Gulliver	Well, all right, he shouldn’t, I know that! But at least I don’t have to be surrounded with little brats jumping up and pulling on my hair all the livelong day. Normally they clamber around me until I feel like [MASK] among the Lepidopterans.
<name>Kaspar</name>	Kaspar	Methuselah	“I fail to understand,” he said, “why it would take six months for someone to inform me of that simple fact.” The old fire was seeping back into this strange, wistful husk of my father. I felt gratified. “Ko ko ko!” [MASK] called.
<name>God</name>	God	Belgium	The doctor frowned then. He said to forgive him but he did not agree. He called my father Reverend. He said, “Reverend, missionary work is a great bargain for [MASK] but it is a hell of a way to deliver the social services.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Adah	We’d run out of blank paper so she had to write out the hundred verses in a very tiny hand on the backs of old letters and envelopes left from when we were still getting mail. [MASK] and I took pity and secretly helped her some.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Nelson	It doesn’t care what prayers we say at bedtime, or whether we admit we believe in it. Does it believe in us, that’s the question. We lay in our beds listening to [MASK]’s steady, high-pitched begging.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Anatole	She titled it “The Inclined Plane of Males.” After the lineup [MASK] marches them into the church and urges them, I guess, to wrestle with their numbers and their French congregations and what not. But they only take it so far, you see.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Nelson	This was fascinating news, and I queried him on the particulars. According to [MASK]’s accounting, nearly half my father’s congregation were relatives of dead twins. It is an interesting precept on which to found a ministry: The First Evangelical Baptist Church of the Twin-Prone.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Rachel	How many of his sins belong also to me? How much of his punishment? [MASK] seems incapable of remorse, but she is not. She wears those pale white eyes around her neck so she can look in every direction and ward off the attack.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Orleanna	“Honestly, [MASK], he would steal anything except the children. And he would have those, too, if he thought he could sell them. If I try to lock things up, he slaps his hands over his heart as if I’ve accused him of murder.
<name>We</name>	We	Freaks	We are both marked, I suppose. [MASK] at first sight, who have learned to take the world at face value. He was marked early on by his orphaned state, his displacement, his zealous skeptical mind, his aloneness.
<name>Mobutu</name>	Mobutu	Mobutu	And what will change? He’ll go on falling over his feet to make deals with the Americans, who still control all our cobalt and diamond mines. In return, every grant of foreign aid goes straight to [MASK] himself.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Leah	Everybody else kind of jumped at that, but [MASK] sat stock-still. Like I said, showing off. She didn’t even blink. Then we all got up and left and she followed us out, and no one in our family said boo to each other all the way home.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Nathan	I felt lucky to get my shoes on the right feet, that’s why. I moved forward only, thinking each morning anew that we were leaving the worst behind. [MASK] believed one thing above all else: that the Lord notices righteousness, and rewards it.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Adah	Maybe they thought the slaves were going to a better place.” [MASK] chimed in: “A little ritual killing, a little infant mortality, just a few of the many healthy natural processes we don’t care to think about.”
<name>Olumide</name>	Olumide	Patrice	[MASK] is just the opposite: studious, sober, and an exact physical copy of his father. He wants to study government and be a Minister of Justice in a very different Africa from this one. I go weak in the knees with dread and admiration, watching him sharpen his hopes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Adah	“Still trying to drag the horse to water,” [MASK] said. “What horse?” “So there was a really horrible incident on the river. A boat frill of kids turned over by a croc, and all of them drowned or eaten or maimed.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Prodigy	“[MASK],” I corrected. “Shut up, damn it! I wish you’d just shut up forever like your Goddamn deaf-mute genius twin!” She whirled around and threw the spatula, not missing my head by all that wide a margin.
<name>Algie</name>	Algie	Axelroot	[MASK] even got himself a little medal of honor for heroic service, which he is very vain of and keeps in a special box in the bedroom. For that reason we couldn’t actually get legally married right away.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Rachel	But considering the lilies as we might, our trimming back got us nowhere close to our goal, even without [MASK]’s beauty aids. We were nearly stumped. And then, hallelujah! At the last possible moment, saved.
<name>Adora</name>	Adora	Ada	Because then you would be free too. And I didn’t want that. I wanted you to remember what he did to us. Tall and straight I may appear, but I will always be [MASK] inside. A crooked little person trying to tell the truth.
<name>David</name>	David	Anatole	But I was unsure which commandment my thoughts had broken—Honor thy father and mother, or not coveting thy neighbor’s parents, or even something more vague about being true to your own race and kind. [MASK] started toward us.
