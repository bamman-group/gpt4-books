<name>Lindbergh</name>	Lindbergh	Raul	He stopped under a lamp and looked directly back at the direct eyes. He wanted honesty. ‘Where are we going?’ ‘Don’t you know? Isn’t it all planned like [MASK]’s flight?’ ‘I was just walking.’
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Wormold	The contents of a cupboard—old letters and bills—were scattered over the floor and a strand of very fair hair tied with black ribbon lay like a washed-up fish among the debris. ‘Why?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>Trevor</name>	Trevor	Carter	What side-street or what doorway? and if the other shot first. . . ? ‘Are your friends Russian, [MASK]? German? American?’ ‘What friends?’ He added simply, ‘I have no friends.’ ‘No friends?’
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Milly	‘Oh, I knew you’d take it like this,’ [MASK] said. ‘I knew it in my heart of hearts. I said two novenas to make it come right, but they haven’t worked. I was so careful too.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Beatrice	‘Go on,’ [MASK] said, ‘one more turn.’ ‘This is one nobody could find out. Absolutely secure.’ ‘What are you waiting for?’ ‘I must have made a mistake. I shall have to start again.’
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Milly	‘I am staying here,’ she said. ‘On holiday?’ ‘No. Work.’ ‘If you have any trouble with your permit,’ he said ambiguously, ‘you must come to me. Good night, [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Milly	He didn’t realize the implication of what he had said until she had dropped him at his door and driven on. CHAPTER 3 i [MASK] said, ‘You’ve had a cup of coffee, and that’s all. Not even a piece of toast.’
<name>Tanner</name>	Tanner	Hawthorne	‘I’m not very knowledgeable that way, sir. I sent them straight on.’ ‘Well, take a good look at them now.’ The Chief spread the drawings over his desk. [MASK] reluctantly left the radiator and was immediately shaken by a shiver.
<name>Quarles</name>	Quarles	Wormold	‘Yes.’ They both converged into the area of light. The professor wore a white dinner-jacket, his hair was white, he had white morning stubble on his chin, and he carried a revolver in his hand which he pointed at [MASK].
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Wormold	That silly business of the whisky. I was tight I suppose. I’m a bit tight now. Not used to apologizing.’ ‘It’s quite all right, [MASK]. Go to bed.’ ‘Sneered at your stammer. Chap shouldn’t do that.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Milly	I’ve got things on my mind. Please don’t pester me. Not today.’ ‘Have you prepared your speech?’ ‘I’ve done my best, but I’m no speaker, [MASK]. I don’t know why they asked me.’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hasselbacher	‘When are you going to drink them?’ ‘Perhaps when they reach two hundred.’ ‘Do you know what I’d do with them if I were you?’ [MASK] said. ‘Play checkers. When you take a piece you drink it.’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Wormold	‘Tell him I’m busy. I’ll call him later.’ ‘He says will you come quick. He sounds strange.’ [MASK] went down to the telephone. Before he could speak he heard an agitated and an old voice.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Wormold	He had put his revolver back in his pocket. The young woman waited until [MASK] began to follow and then brought up the rear like a watchdog. He half expected her to bite his ankle. He thought, Unless I speak soon, I shall never speak.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Maria	‘You see,’ she said to the professor, ‘she’s threatening us now. First the cardinal and then . . .’ ‘The cardinal was only doing his duty. After all he’s [MASK]’s cousin.’ ‘You’re afraid of him.
<name>Trimmer</name>	Trimmer	Carter	‘It’s not only the speaking.’ He leant forward across the table towards that common-or-garden Nottwich face on which he felt he could rely for incredulity, reassurance, the easy humour based on inexperience: he was safe with [MASK].
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Carter	The voice had just the right chill of injured pride. ‘I want to apologize to you, [MASK]. That silly business of the whisky. I was tight I suppose. I’m a bit tight now. Not used to apologizing.’
<name>He</name>	He	Wormold	‘I mean here—having a holiday from the dagoes. Back in British territory.’ [MASK] thought of the huts he had seen along the harbour and a hopeless old man asleep in a patch of shade and a ragged child nursing a piece of driftwood.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Cifuentes	‘[MASK] has been interrogated by the police.’ He added with relief, ‘He’s blown, so he’s no use to us now.’ ‘Then aren’t you blown too?’ ‘He gave nothing away.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Childhood	[MASK] was the germ of all mistrust. You were cruelly joked upon and then you cruelly joked. You lost the remembrance of pain through inflicting it. But somehow, through no virtue of his own, he had never taken that course. Lack of character perhaps.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Milly	You may as well speak to her. You have plenty of opportunity on her way from school. But [MASK]’s got sense. I don’t think you stand a chance.’ ‘In that case I may ask you later to use a father’s influence.’
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Carter	‘You aren’t expecting anyone, are you, [MASK]?’ ‘No, why?’ ‘I thought—the way you watched the door . . .’ ‘I don’t know a soul in this town. I told you.’
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Carter	[MASK]’s pocket was heavy on his hip. Of course it might be his pipe he carried. He sat at the wheel again and grumbled. ‘You can see that sort of show anywhere. Just tarts undressing.’ ‘You didn’t help her much.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Wormold	Losing the rhythm their heads came into gentle collision. ‘I’m sorry.’ ‘My fault.’ Rock rock rock. Somebody scraped a chair in the patio. ‘Your wife?’ asked [MASK]. ‘No. Nobody at all.
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Segura	As a matter of fact he’s one of my best informers. I always have him stationed here when I meet [MASK]. An elementary precaution. I’m not as careless as you think.’ ‘You’ve never told H.Q.’ ‘There’s no point.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Wormold	The Chief took out his black monocle and [MASK] was surprised by the baby-blue eye. He said, ‘We thought the best thing for you under the circumstances would be to stay at home—on our training staff. Lecturing. How to run a station abroad.
<name>John</name>	John	Wormold	The head-waiter put his hand on the dog and then looked up at [MASK]. The tear-filled eyes so acbused him of standing there alive while the dog was dead that he nearly found it in his heart to apologize, but instead he turned and went.
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Milly	He said sadly, ‘I shan’t. I wouldn’t know what to say.’ ‘I bet you’d speak better than any of them.’ ‘Oh no. I may be the oldest member, [MASK], but I’m the smallest too.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Maria	‘You lying hound,’ she screamed at him. ‘You said you’d never seen her.’ ‘I haven’t.’ ‘Then why do you call her [MASK]?’ she cried and began to do triumphant dance-steps with an imaginary partner.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Carter	I need a drink badly before we go on.’ ‘Are these whore-houses?’ ‘No. We’ll go to a house later.’ He thought, If only [MASK] when he left the wheel had grabbed his gun, it would have been so easy to fire.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Milly	‘I thought you were being sad and serious.’ ‘That’s why I wanted to laugh. Do you remember the clown last year, [MASK]?’ ‘He walked off the end of a ladder and fell in a bucket of whitewash.’
<name>Querry</name>	Querry	Wormold	The supercilious clerk from the Consulate appeared in the shop at five o’clock the next afternoon. He stood stiffly among the vacuum cleaners like a disapproving tourist in a museum of phallic objects. He told [MASK] that the Ambassador wanted to see him. ‘Will tomorrow morning do?’
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Wormold	A murderer had no right to be homesick; a murderer should be a machine, and I too have to become a machine. [MASK] thought, feeling in his pocket the handkerchief he would have to use to clean the fingerprints when the time came.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Wormold	‘Because I don’t know the way.’ In a mad world it always seems simpler to obey. [MASK] led the stranger through a door at the back, down a short passage, and indicated the toilet. ‘It’s in there.’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Segura	‘You are finished anyway.’ He moved his hand slowly over the board as though he were carrying an egg in a spoon. ‘See?’ He captured one piece, two pieces, three . . . ‘Drink this, [MASK].’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hawthorne	That’s why he’s not a member of the Country Club—nothing to do with the broken marriage. You’re a romantic, [MASK]. Women have come and gone in his life; I suspect they never meant as much to him as his work.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Hawthorne	The post would suit her. She is not too young. She is fond of children.’ ‘What this station will need,’ [MASK] said, ‘is someone who speaks Spanish. The love of children is not essential.’
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Wormold	[MASK] put his hand down to e was preoccupied by fear ?at the dog’s head and as though by accident he knocked the glass from the table. ‘You pretended not to know the doctor.’ ‘What doctor?’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Hawthorne	He was under orders now. He heard [MASK] tiptoeing near. ‘Give me a few minutes to get away, old man. Do you know who that was? The policeman. A bit suspicious, eh?’ ‘He may have recognized my legs under the door.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Milly	‘Are you learning all about vacuum cleaners?’ [MASK] asked. ‘That thing you are holding is a sprayer.’ ‘Is it? I just picked it up in case I had to hit someone.’
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Hawthorne	I was told once that you were no judge of men, but I backed my private judgement. Well done, [MASK].’ ‘Thank you, sir.’ He had his hand on the door-knob.
<name>Esquire</name>	Esquire	Milly	It’s one of those ghastly lives, isn’t it, like unesco and modern writers in conference? It’s been fun here with you.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Now go away.’ He went to the magazine stall and found [MASK].
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Wormold	The boy had begun to collect at the age of six and somehow, with the quick jog-trot of time, it slipped [MASK]’s memory that his nephew was now long past seventeen and had probably given up his collection years ago.
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Cifuentes	Did he say [MASK]? Oh, you Spanish oaf. Just because he talked to me one day at the Club while you were in the shower you go and hire desperadoes to kill him.’ ‘Please, dear, be reasonable.
<name>Wicksteed</name>	Wicksteed	Hasselbacher	‘[MASK]’s not a politician. He’s an old doctor and he’s lived here for thirty years.’ ‘All the same, you’d be surprised . . . But I agree with you, it would be conspicuous if you dropped him.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Wormold	‘I suppose,’ [MASK] said, ‘I’d better not go.’ He felt a surprising disappointment. ‘It will be the first lunch I’ve missed in ten years. They’d even asked me to speak. The firm always expects me to attend.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Milly	‘No.’ ‘What happened?’ [MASK] asked. ‘Oh, I got to see through him. I mean literally, not in a nasty way. He was very thin and concave and he got sort of transparent.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Henry	‘I was just wondering, that’s all.’ ‘You can’t buy account-books for a penny. And pen-nibs— nobody uses pen-nibs nowadays.’ ‘Forget it. Just something [MASK] said to me. A natural mistake.’
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Milly	Waiter, tell the conductor to play “Happy Birthday to You”.’ ‘Do no such thing,’ [MASK] said. ‘How can you be so—so vulgar?’ ‘Me? Vulgar?’
<name>Lyudmila</name>	Lyudmila	Milly	‘Don’t worry about [MASK]. I’ll watch her like a lynx.’ ‘And who’s going to watch you?’ ‘I’m in this line of business; it’s my own choice. You needn’t feel responsible for me.’
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Milly	Why am I so nostalgic? I suppose because I have a little money tucked away and soon I must decide to go away for ever. I wonder if [MASK] will be able to settle down in a secretarial-training college in a grey street in north London.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Beatrice	‘Are you all right?’ [MASK] called from outside. ‘Are you dying? Shall I break down the door?’ He wrapped a towel round his middle and emerged into his bedroom, which was now his office.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Beatrice	‘Yes, sir?’ ‘Did you find that penny note-book?’ ‘No, sir.’ ‘Perhaps [MASK] will.’ . . . PART THREE . i CHAPTER 1 It was not a night
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Carter	He said, ‘We must see each other again.’ ‘An occasion like this would be useless if it didn’t bring people together.’ ‘I wouldn’t have met you or [MASK] without it.’ They all three had another whisky.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Milly	He thought, I am the cost. ‘I bet you’ll be a sensation.’ ‘I’m trying hard not to be a sensation at this lunch.’ [MASK] went to school and he sat on at the table.
<name>Who</name>	Who	Raul	‘A man’s death.’ ‘[MASK]?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Did you know him?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Tell me about him.’ ‘I don’t want to talk.’ ‘It would be better to talk.’
<name>James</name>	James	Lopez	‘What do you mean, a living wage? The agency pays you very well as it is.’ ‘This will mean a great deal of work,’ [MASK] said. ‘It will, will it? What work?’ ‘Personal service.’
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Carter	No thank you.’ [MASK] put out his hand, but the waiter had already moved on towards the service-door. ‘Perhaps you would prefer a dry Martini, sir?’ a voice said. He turned. It was the head-waiter.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Wormold	[MASK] lay down flat on the bed and shut his eyes. ‘I don’t understand a thing,’ he said. ‘Not a thing. It’s a coincidence. It must be.’ ‘They’re getting rough—whoever they are.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Milly	‘The idea, where anyone can see them!’ ‘It’s all right,’ [MASK] said, ‘it’s only my father.’ The sound of her voice separated them. The old lady said, ‘Is that your mother?’ ‘No.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Segura	With every second the man was becoming human, a creature like oneself whom one might pity or console, not kill. Who knew what excuses were buried below any violent act? He drew [MASK]’s gun. ‘What?’ ‘Get out.’
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Wormold	‘Yes.’ ‘Do you keep him under observation?’ ‘No. What is the use?’ [MASK] was clinging to the edge of the board with what was left of his foiled pincer-movement, but he had lost his base.
<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	Cifuentes	‘You said something about [MASK], young man?’ ‘He was shot at this evening.’ ‘Who by?’ ‘I don’t know exactly, but it’s all part of the same round-up.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Hawthorne	Anything above that will have to be specially authorized.’ ‘You are going much too fast.’ ‘Free of income-tax, you know,’ [MASK] said and winked slyly. The wink somehow didn’t go with the royal monogram.
<name>Enigma</name>	Enigma	Rudy	‘I’m certain of everything except the 7.’ ‘That’s fine. Which seven? I suppose now we might have to work through about six thousand arrangements. I’m no mathematician.’ ‘[MASK] must have it written down somewhere.’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Wormold	I have to do it, [MASK] thought, before he confesses any more to me. With every second the man was becoming human, a creature like oneself whom one might pity or console, not kill. Who knew what excuses were buried below any violent act?
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Wormold	The wind rocked the car, and the spray broke across the traffic-lanes and misted the seaward window. The hot night tasted of salt. [MASK] swung the car away from the sea. The girl said, lHace demasiado calor.’ ‘What’s she saying now?’
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Wormold	‘Yes.’ He hesitated. ‘It seems rude going out like this before h-he rings. Can’t you wait five minutes, [MASK]?’ ‘Say you’ll be back by one—unless you decide to make a night of it.’
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Carter	‘Rotten brandy too. I wouldn’t wonder if it was doped.’ ‘Your whisky was more than doped, [MASK].’ He was trying to heat his anger up and not to remember his ineffective victim struggling with the corset and blushing at his failure.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Hawthorne	[MASK] explained. He took out the limp mauve rag and put it in the ash-tray. ‘With your dinner? What an odd thing to do,’ the Chief said. ‘It can hardly have improved the meal. Personally I detest orchids.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Segura	I didn’t notice. I must be drunk.’ ‘You drunk?’ ‘A little.’ ‘I’m drunk too. You know I’m drunk. You are trying to make me drunk Why?’ ‘Don’t be a fool, [MASK].
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Hawthorne	‘Of course I’m English.’ ‘And you refuse to serve your country?’ ‘I didn’t say that. But the vacuum cleaners take up a great deal of time.’ ‘They are an excellent cover,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Prudence</name>	Prudence	Milly	He also wished that the snap-action coupling had coupled for once with a snap. CHAPTER 2 He could distinguish the approach of [MASK] like that of a police-car from a long way off. Whistles instead of sirens warned him of her coming.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Wormold	It was necessary to alter the official statistics in case someone in the head office thought to compare the two reports, and sometimes [MASK] forgot he had altered a figure. Addition and subtraction were never his strong points. A decimal point got shifted and had to be chased up and down a dozen columns.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Beatrice	The professor said quickly, ‘I absolutely assure you, dear, that I know nobody called [MASK]. Nobody.’ The young woman gave a tigerish laugh. ‘You seem to have come here,’ the professor said, ‘with the sole purpose of making trouble.’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Beatrice	‘It’s his escape from loneliness and memory,’ [MASK] said. ‘Don’t you ever want to escape?’ ‘I suppose we all do sometimes.’ ‘I know what that kind of loneliness is like,’ she said with sympathy.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Seraphina	So I thought perhaps if I could help you to cut the housekeeping by fasting . ..’ ‘What good . . . ?’ ‘Well, then, you might be able to afford to take a family-membership. You ought to enter me as [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Milly	He thought: I must do something, give them some names to trace, recruit an agent, keep them happy. He remembered how [MASK] used to play at shops and give him her pocket money for imaginary purchases.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Milly	‘Yes.’ ‘I’ll get the chaplain to say a Mass for every year we knew him.’ There hadn’t, he realized, been any need to break a death gently, so far as [MASK] was concerned. All deaths to her were happy deaths.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Wormold	‘You’ll find that chair more comfortable. Now it’s no use beating about the bush, [MASK]. You are in trouble.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Of course I know nothing—nothing at all—of what you are doing here.’
<name>Russian</name>	Russian	Russian	I think perhaps it’s time we gave him a bonus. He’s trying to compile a complete list for us of foreign agents here—American as well as [MASK]. Wild duck—that’s what he calls them.’ ‘It would be quite a coup.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Teresa	I’ve got to get you out of here.’ No one seemed unduly disturbed. The fat woman drained her wine and put on a pair of knickers; the girl who was called [MASK] pulled on her second stocking.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Wormold	His suit was just as immaculate as when [MASK] had met him first; the only sign of the great heat was a little powder caked under his left ear. He said, ‘Take a pew.’ Even the slang was back. ‘Thanks.’
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Lopez	‘While she is out, I will bring you a young lady to see. If you don’t like her, I will bring another.’ ‘You’ll do nothing of the sort. Those are not the kind of services I want, [MASK].
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Carter	‘Will tomorrow morning do?’ He was working on his last report, [MASK]’s death and his resignation. ‘No, it won’t. He telephoned from his home. You are to go there straight away.’
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Lopez	‘Oh yes, yes.’ ‘I was interested that you had enlarged your staff. That charming secretary with the siphon and the coat that wouldn’t close. And the young man.’ ‘I need someone to superintend accounts. [MASK] is not reliable.’
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Hasselbacher	‘Come inside,’ [MASK] said. The sitting-room was in confusion; it was as though a malevolent child had been at work among the tubular chairs, opening this, upsetting that, smashing and sparing at the dictate of some irrational impulse.
<name>Greene</name>	Greene	Wormold	The officer of the tourist police had fallen contentedly asleep after propping his cigar over an ash-tray; there were no tourists at this hour to protect or to supervise. [MASK] said, ‘If it’s about a cleaner, come down to the shop.’
<name>Millie</name>	Millie	Milly	She said, ‘My darling, don’t worry about that any longer. You won’t be left twice.’ As they kissed, [MASK] came in carrying a large sewing basket for an old lady. She looked particularly virtuous; she had probably started a spell of doing good deeds.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	Wormold	And, of course, he’s British.’ ‘I still don’t see . . .’ [MASK] cooled his mouth with his morning daiquiri. Seven minutes to get to the Wonder Bar: seven minutes back to the store: six minutes for companionship.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Rudy	You can empty what’s in the drawers into your safe and [MASK] can keep his things in them.’ ‘I’ve never used a combination.’ ‘It’s perfectly simple. You choose three sets of numbers you can keep in your head.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Teresa	What do you want with [MASK]?’ ‘Yes. What do you want with me?’ the thin girl demanded, coming forward holding out one stocking. Her little breasts were the size of pears. ‘Who are you?’
<name>George</name>	George	Beatrice	‘Come in where? There’s no room for him.’ ‘He can sleep in the office,’ [MASK] said. ‘There isn’t enough room for a bed and that safe and my desk.’ ‘I’ll get you a smaller desk.
<name>Lucia</name>	Lucia	Milly	‘What should I be worried about, dear [MASK], on your birthday? Except about the years of course.’ ‘Is seventeen so old?’ ‘For me they have gone too quickly.’ The man in the tight uniform stood by their table and bowed.
<name>George</name>	George	Lopez	I haven’t asked her. Do you think she’s lovely?’ ‘Rather lovely. In a way.’ [MASK] called up the stairs, ‘There is a lady here. She says you expect her.’ ‘Tell her to come up.’
<name>Lev</name>	Lev	Rudy	He went into [MASK]’s room and began to twist the knob—four times to the left, three times thoughtfully to the right. His towel kept on slipping. ‘Besides, anyone can find out the date of my birth from my registration-card.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Milly	[MASK] said, ‘Do you love my father?’ He thought: One day I can come back and settle these questions. But now there are more important problems: I have to discover how to kill a man. Surely they produced handbooks to tell you that?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Carter	‘What?’ ‘Get out.’ [MASK] stood against the whore-house door with a look of sullen complaint rather than fear. His fear was of women, not of violence. He said, ‘You are making a mistake.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Emma	‘That still does not explain your wandering about the streets at night.’ ‘There’s no law . . .’ ‘No law, but prudent people stay at home. Only mischief-makers go out.’ ‘I couldn’t sleep for thinking of [MASK].’
<name>Corleone</name>	Corleone	Carter	‘Oh. They don’t talk to me that way. Not that way at all.’ There was always, of course, the possibility of a knife. But for a knife you had to be closer to [MASK] than he could ever hope to get.
