<name>Sarah Bernhardt</name>	Sarah Bernhardt	Rachel	She leaned forward in the dimness, scarcely daring to breathe lest she miss a single glance of those eyes, a single syllable from those lips. [MASK] was giving out her best. But for one member of that audience it was more than a magnificent theatrical performance.
<name>He</name>	He	Henry	she questioned, mystified and annoyed. “Have they not plenty to eat and drink in their own homes?” [MASK] had to confess that the logic of the surprise tea party was altogether beyond him. But he felt sure she would know how to meet the emergency.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Why”—Ora	She brought a small mirror from the next room and held it up before the girl. “[MASK]’s anxious expression relaxed slightly—“I wouldn’t hardly know it was me, but—” “Now no more of these buts, if you please.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Henriette	“We are gathered together tonight,” she began solemnly, “as has long been our custom, for a Little Season of Prayer.” o • a There was a light in the study window as [MASK] came in sight of the parsonage two hours later.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Henriette	It was the only sign of life from the heap of silk and lace before the fire. “I should also speak of religion.” [MASK] felt she could no longer postpone a subject which she knew must be faced, and which she dreaded to open.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Berthe	He’s not very good at that.” [MASK]’s sudden laughter filled the room with clear, untroubled gayety. Ten o’clock. A distant clock struck, and the Due rose to make his farewells. How his height and strength filled the room!
<name>Mme. Loisel</name>	Mme. Loisel	Henriette	Each pleasant day new excursions were planned and led by the old Marechal; and [MASK]’s protests that piano practice must continue and the weekly letter to the children’s father should not be forgotten. were easily brushed aside.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Cyrus	It has ceased to operate.” “Suppose it has—temporarily! It will work in time. What has been done once can be done again. But tell me what they’re saying of [MASK]. I caught his name just now.”
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Raynald	“That’s the most important part, because [MASK] and I will try to guess what it will be while you’re gone. You shall have the first guess, chSri. What kind of flower do you think we’ll find in the napkin?”
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Matthew	He walked the floor, he said, all alone in the middle of the night, knowing a telegraph fine was going to be laid between two worlds and he was going to put it through.” But even [MASK] had been astounded by his brother’s response.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Henriette	[MASK] thought, following the swift, gay grace of the small body; noting the merry glance of those clear, fearless eyes, the fine bright hair that fell about the warmly rounded cheeks. She was one of those rare children who seem to carry some charm against evil and pain and despair.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Aunty	[MASK]. Did you see the morning-glory by the fence is out at last? And there are more sweet peas and mignonette, and I’m sure that bud on the yellow rosebush must be open. I’ll have time to pick some before breakfast if I hurry.”
<name>Madame Merle</name>	Madame Merle	Henri	“I mean children, [MASK], have you thought of that?” He reddened at her words and shifted uneasily in his chair. No unmarried American or English woman would have thought of mentioning the possibility of unborn children as anything but impersonal gifts from heaven.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Henriette	[MASK] guessed that from the way he reddened at mention of it. But he managed to keep his voice cool and deliberate. “I’m sorry if I caused you inconvenience,” he explained. “But I left my room early to take the older girls on a little outing.
<name>John</name>	John	Henri	Yes, he is more what I believed these Yankees to be—hard-headed, as they say, but also, I think, farsighted. [MASK] is not like either of these two. They are more shrewd and dominant than this youngest brother.
<name>Marcelle</name>	Marcelle	Clara	[MASK] was asking. “You cried when the 71st marched by, and now you’re walking ever so slow and you look—queer.” “I am tired, cherie,” she said. “If I walk slowly it must be because my heart is heavy with the weight of this war.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Ora	“I guess I’m not very brave,” the girl sighed. “I was not brave, [MASK], when I had to leave my friends and all that I knew behind; when I had to cross those miles of water alone and come to a strange country.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Henri	She had not seen him look so stricken since they had heard the news of that last cable failure. “[MASK], what is it?” She hurried to him, searching his face in alarm. “You are ill?” “No, my dear.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Henriette	[MASK] turned her about firmly and shut the door. To her surprise the Due was pacing the long hall, evidently waiting for her. She was quick to notice a mixture of concern and annoyance in his face as he greeted her.
<name>the jeweler</name>	the jeweler	Henriette	No wonder, [MASK] thought, that the shopkeeper will let him buy it for half-price. It’s hardly a cheerful subject. “You’ll never see one like it anywhere,” the jeweler was saying.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Henry	Pale mid-April sunlight slanted across the room, so dear, so familiar, where she and [MASK] had been so secure in their love, in each other, in the hope that somehow the worst could not happen to this world of which they were a part.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no clear answer in the given context, so this is just a guess based on common usage of the phrase "you're right" in conversation.)	probably (Note: There is no clear answer in the given context, so this is just a guess based on common usage of the phrase "you're right" in conversation.)	Henri	“An old friend of mine.” “I should hardly call him an old friend, [MASK],” she protested; “rather, I should say, an early friend.” “You’re right.” He smiled. “I stand corrected.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Monsieur	Once more she dipped her pen, and tried another beginning to the letter; and once more she crumpled the sheet and added it to others in the waste basket. “My dear [MASK],” she began simply. “Do not reproach yourself or others for what has happened.
<name>Lillian</name>	Lillian	Henriette	“Bravo, bravo!” she cried out as the curtain fell. She was oblivious to the curious glances that her enthusiasm drew from those about her. As the girl in blue satin rose to promenade with her escort during the intermission, her bouquet fell at [MASK]’s feet.
<name>Orson</name>	Orson	Henri	They had sat incredulous in the not too crowded theater before the miracle of genius that wrapped a slender, dark-eyed man of twenty-four in the mantle of dramatic authority. When the curtain fell for the first intermission they turned excitedly to each other. “Oh, [MASK],” she exclaimed.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Henry	In the reunion with [MASK], in the beauty and sense of complete well-being that had taken possession of her as they traveled those miles together, she had forgotten her weariness and all her doubts and misgivings. Now they rose to engulf her as she faced the meeting upon which so much depended.
<name>Mr. Kettering</name>	Mr. Kettering	Henry	There can be little doubt,” she prompted him. “That is why I asked you to come when my husband and my niece would not be here. They must not know—yet.” “I think it would be wise for me to talk to [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Henriette	“And there is another matter.” [MASK] pressed her handkerchief tightly between her hands as she summoned courage to mention the other obstacle that she found so difficult to express. “It is rather a personal one which I could not explain in my letter.
<name>she</name>	she	Madame	He was speaking to her while [MASK] continued to babble and jerk hysterically. “I’d been working all night on that paper for the Academie,” he was saying. “I couldn’t sleep, so when it grew light I went out to walk.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mademoiselle	She could not shut her eyes to this promise of budding fruitfulness all about her. Even the children seemed aware of the significance. They were continually asking questions that stabbed her anew as she tried to make plausible answers. “[MASK], will every blossom turn into an apple?”
<name>him</name>	him	Henry	She would have to convince him of her right to belong there, and so he quickened the challenge she had come prepared to meet. Until he gave the signal she would wait. And she must keep [MASK] waiting although his urgency was growing pathetic.
<name>her father</name>	her father	Henry	There was delicate shadblow in the woods when she drove with [MASK] on his parish calls, or when she went exploring with some young neighbor and returned with wet shoes and draggled skirts and a basket of ferns or violet plants to set out in her border.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	mademoiselle	If he did not instantly label her as the new governess, she had at least one point in her favor. She heard his returning footsteps and had just time to reach her chair and spread her skirts about her when he entered. “The Due and Duchesse will see you, [MASK].
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Henri	“[MASK] is too kind and generous, madame,” she ventured. “I am sometimes fearful that he does not see faults in those he—” She broke off, not wishing to commit herself too far. “Yes, I know, he believes the best of every one.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	mademoiselle	“It’s not my tooth that aches.” “Yes, but it’s going to be for you, too, [MASK]. Well wear our best clothes and sit in a box and not go to bed till midnight. Now can’t you guess?”
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Henriette	She was young and fair, with broad brows under smoothly parted hair and clear, thoughtful eyes that lighted in eager responsiveness. “She is kind and intelligent,” [MASK] decided after the introductions were over and they walked together up the flagstone path between orange lilies and phlox.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henri	Probably he had forgotten his Sunday clothes had all been laid out on a chair last night. She must hurry, or he would have eveiy drawer turned upside down just when she had finished tidying them. “[MASK],” she called, “wait a moment.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Americans	Still he was old enough to know better. One expected a certain amount of crudity from [MASK], but such blundering as this was too much to overlook. “I see,” she responded crisply, “that you read the newspapers.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Albert	“Please go quickly, [MASK], and when you return tomorrow act as if you knew nothing.” He stood by the schoolroom door, holding her hand and search- ing her face with distress and perplexity in the eyes behind his spectacles.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	“Oh, here’s some music,” [MASK] exclaimed, looking up from a cabinet she had been investigating. Evidently the former tenants of the villa had not been inclined to classical music. The pieces were all gay and popular, with waltzes and polkas predominating.
<name>the world</name>	the world	Paris	“That’s exactly what I meant. Somehow this doesn’t seem like a real snowstorm. It’s as if you and I and all [MASK] were caught fast in a little round globe with the flakes going round and round like frozen stars.”
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Lisette	[MASK]’s hatred and vindictive threats at parting had just come to her mind. “I think I know who is behind this latest piece of slander,” she told him. “But that’s no help now.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Henriette	[MASK] gave no sign that the thrust had gone home. She went on speaking steadily. “I’m alone in the world, madame, and I’ve learned to take what bits of love come my way and piece them together as best I can to keep me warm.
<name>Portia</name>	Portia	Louise	Voices met and mingled in a quick exchange of greetings; the lamp laid a charmed, mellow circle over the three who drew together in its light. A servant hurried in with a hastily prepared tray of food—cold meat and salad and rolls; milk for [MASK] and a decanter of wine for the Due.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Henry	[MASK]’s rock was warm in the sun. She sank down in one of its worn hollows, grateful for the enduring stone. The maple tree in the cleft had been struck by lightning one year, but new shoots were flourishing about the shattered trunk.
<name>She</name>	She	Henriette	Yet he was loath to refuse. Such a chance might never come his way again, and it was so exactly the work that he longed to do. “But certainly you will accept!” [MASK] had flung out her arms in one of her unguarded Gallic gestures.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Henri	“[MASK],” she had said, bending over the rosy buds and starry white flowers he put in her hands. “It is the strangest, sweetest perfume in the world—cool like snow, yet sweet as spice.
<name>Miss Emily's</name>	Miss Emily's	Albert	It had been under her feet that morning as she reached [MASK]’s door. She had picked it up and carried it with her later. They had not taken it from her, and now in the failing fight she pored over the meager account.
<name>got</name>	got	Americans	Haven’t you [MASK] troubles enough of your own without crossing the sea to hunt down more?” “Yes,” he agreed simply, again ignoring her bitterness, “we have troubles of our own, as you say, but yours happen to be very important to me.
<name>Osmond</name>	Osmond	Adolphe	It was half past nine when she entered the large, old-fashioned salon where some eighteen or twenty guests had already gathered. She slipped in unobtrusively through the adjoining study and joined her host’s brother [MASK] and others whom she knew slightly.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Matthew	The months she spent with her family circle were more in the nature of long visits, and it could not be denied by the generous [MASK] and his wife that the child benefited by advantages they could not give her.
<name>Mrs. Ryan</name>	Mrs. Ryan	Maxine	She knew even before the Abbe stood at the door in his vestments with the young altar boy he had brought with him, even before she heard [MASK]’s smothered exclamation and saw her lift reverent hands to cross herself and then reach for her rosary, that this was no ordinary visit.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Henry	A tea-squall’s no place for a man. And whatever you do, don’t let on we told you!” For once [MASK]’s absent-mindedness left him. He realized that this was a crisis: one in which he could do little to help.
<name>Lizzie</name>	Lizzie	Henriette	[MASK] walked in the center of her little group, and if by farsighted strategy she managed to maneuver the three first couples past masculine obstacles, the set behind her would invariably lose composure. If she turned her attention to her rear guard, then those in advance might be guilty of some breach of etiquette.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Henriette	[MASK] felt a rush of satisfaction at his spontaneous call for her, but she knew too much to come forward until the Duchesse gave her permission. She waited quietly at the foot of the bed, hoping that she might be left alone with the boy and his mother.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Louise	She knew only that for her this was the end of an era, and it seemed strange to find the older girls still busy under the lamplight with their books and embroidery and games about them. “Oh, there you are, mademoiselle!” [MASK] sprang up as she entered.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Henry	“Oh, to tell her that I heard and felt as no one in all this city could have done!” she thought as she joined the audience that crowded the aisles. If [MASK] or any member of his family had been beside her she would have curbed the impulse that followed this thought.
<name>he</name>	he	Henry	It was so pleasant to ride along unfamiliar roads through the rich farming country that [MASK] knew and loved. Even when he grew absent-minded discussing some new article or his next sermon and they found themselves miles from their destination, it was adventurous, and farmers and their families were always kind and hospitable.
<name>the father</name>	the father	Henriette	He often stopped on these trips, and upon each visit [MASK] feared he would announce that the time had come for the child to return. But when he left her with them she would draw a long breath as if she had been granted a reprieve.
<name>Lillian</name>	Lillian	Rachel	His announcements that [MASK] would be loaded down with jewels valued at some two hundred and forty thousand dollars and presented to her by many different admirers, was certainly in the worst possible taste. Yet she read eagerly any and all comments upon the actress and her troupe.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Henriette	[MASK] came almost to dread the mention of his name. Not that she had lost faith in him or in the great undertaking; she still believed in the driving force of his energy and in the indomitable will power that was strong enough to remove mountains.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Louise	She went through the ordeal of good night, set the schoolroom to rights, and reached her own quarters at last. It was only then, with the door locked against possible interruption, that she dared to read the letter [MASK] had delivered.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Henriette	“Let’s act as if you were when people stare at us through their glasses.” [MASK] quickly discouraged this idea, but as she marshaled them down to the carriage, she could not help feeling flattered at the naive suggestion.
<name>Mr. Dursley</name>	Mr. Dursley	mademoiselle	“I am not going to mince words with you, [MASK],” he began in his rather thick, provincial voice. “I’ve been greatly disturbed by what has come to me in the post.” He cleared his throat and fumbled among the papers before him.
<name>Mme. de Saint-Ange</name>	Mme. de Saint-Ange	Henriette	“I will speak to my daughter,” he agreed hesitantly, “but I can’t answer for her. She’s been tried too far.” “The Duchesse is noted for her goodness of heart,” [MASK] pointed out as she rose.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Henriette	“Yes,” [MASK] admitted, “and she has the spirit that goes with her hair. She had need of it yesterday when the children next door set her on their sled and she went down that steep hill alone. She will not repeat the little French noel
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Henriette	She is not afraid of the snow for her household . . .” A great gray-green moth fluttered close to the lamp. But the voice did not falter. [MASK] looked up and saw the hand that brushed it away.
<name>Mrs. Phelps</name>	Mrs. Phelps	Henriette	“Look at all the women that can do it. I’d swap the stove for a piano any day, but much good it would do me.” She stared at her large hands and sighed. “You wish to play the piano?” [MASK] tried to hide her astonishment.
<name>John Marshall</name>	John Marshall	Cyrus	I shall miss him for he had grown dear to me. I am filled with thankfulness that he lived to see his children prosper; that it was given him to know and share in [MASK]’ achievement. He rejoiced in his sons’ accomplishments, but he took no glory to himself.
<name>He</name>	He	Henriette	He gave an order to the coachman to return and stood watching their carriage roll away. Thinking over his words on the hot drive back to the chateau, [MASK] tried to decide what lay behind them. He had been reluctant to stay. That was plain.
<name>Mrs. Whatsit</name>	Mrs. Whatsit	Henriette	Others, [MASK] noticed, wore these same badges proudly displayed. There would be some one waiting for them at the end of even longer joumeyings. “Bon voyage,” she wished the woman, and moved away. She heard a fiddle playing a lively jig.
<name>Aravis</name>	Aravis	Berthe	They all ran towards the figure which had emerged from the trees. Swift-footed [MASK] reached him first—excited words about fires and apples and ghosts tumbling pell-mell from her lips. He set her on his shoulder and advanced into the circle of firelight.
<name>John</name>	John	Henri	I shall expect you to wear your hair exactly so when I see you next, and I shall tell [MASK] to report to me if you have not curls when he comes to call.” She seated herself once more and resumed the sewing.
<name>She</name>	She	Henriette	Yes, by all means go in and see if you can distract him. I will return later this afternoon.” The two men started along the corridor towards the other wing and the Duchesse’s apartments. [MASK] reached for the door knob, but before she turned it the Due wheeled about.
<name>him</name>	him	Matthew	“How strong is the bond between them!” She felt sure she would have known [MASK] for a member of the clan wherever she had encountered him. There was a marked family resemblance, though in some peculiar way he seemed a composite of them all.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Albert	“It’s only a formality. I am wanted for questioning, they say. Please, [MASK], don’t try to reason with them. You only make it more difficult for us both. I’ll be back again in a little while.”
<name>her</name>	her	Henriette	The one assigned to [MASK] had two windows that faced the little park and the brick row beyond. It was a pleasant outlook over the trees, and a cool breeze stirred the crisp white muslin curtains. The furnishings were plain, but the place was immaculate, and everything had been arranged for her comfort.
<name>Countess</name>	Countess	Henriette	“I know; but, [MASK], they see you here every day as I do. They know there can be no truth in these reports that you and the Due—” He broke off in embarrassment. “Why do you hesitate to say the word?”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Cassie	She stood by the stove, where the kettle rocked on a red-hot lid. Through the clouds of steam that rose about her, [MASK]’s plain moist face wore an ageless look, like a moon on the wane, but still holding its own against the elements.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Monsieur	It did not adjoin the next apartment, so they were store of privacy there. “[MASK],” she spoke to him through the darkness, “I must know if she is safe. She did herself no harm?” “No,” he said.
<name>He</name>	He	Henriette	Why, you’d never hear the last of it. No, we’ll just have to brazen it out between us some way!” [MASK] ventured no further suggestions as they set the china and silver in place.
<name>John Galt</name>	John Galt	Matthew	[MASK] was a practical man. Whatever else might be said of him, that was certain. When he built bridges there was no guesswork about them. Their spans were true, and they were built to last. When he laid railroad lines they fulfilled all requirements.
<name>Old Marquis</name>	Old Marquis	Grimly	[MASK] he bent to capture one of the invaders on a potato plant. Such a remark from another would have sounded ludicrous, but this old patriarch lent dignity even to garden pests. “But, monsieur,” she persisted, “the caterpillar and the bug are not doing evil in their own eyes.
<name>any proper name</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	any proper name (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Henry	She tried not to let [MASK] see how empty and dismal she thought it, or how much she wished that the square parlors on either side of the hall had not been painted a depressing yellow-green that would clash with the claret-brown of her chairs and sofa.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Henriette	The wind was fresh as the tender steamed away from the Celtic. [MASK]’s bonnet ribbons began to flap, and her long cloak and skirts to billow. There was nothing for her to do but join the other women passengers in the stuffy cabin.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Clara	[MASK], even at that tender age, had a character and mind of her own. Not only did she bear a marked family resemblance in features and coloring, but the traits of determination, independence, and impetuous affection were already noticeable.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Henriette	[MASK] and the two younger children had joined the rest of the family there a week before, and the reunion had been a happy one. The weather was fine, with sunlight glittering on each wave that broke in rhythmic whiteness on the beach below their windows.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Louise	And now they were stained with blood. The sudden recollection of a spring night came to her, the night when he and [MASK] had surprised her by their return from the country. He had poured out a glass of port, and some of the wine had spilled.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Henriette	“I leave such matters to my husband,” she said. “And to tell you the truth I know very little about this state you speak of.” The girl’s eyes widened in shocked surprise, but [MASK] paid no heed to that disapproval.
<name>Amyas</name>	Amyas	Cassie	“I put the extra leaves in, and they’ll be room for ten each side and one at each end,” [MASK] was saying from the dining room. “If more turn up we’ll squeeze ’em in some way.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	mademoiselle	I’ve been spied upon at every turn, and my words and actions doubted and maligned till I was tried almost past the point of endurance.” “Yes, [MASK],” the Abbe answered with a faintly sardonic inflection. “I have often marveled at your endurance.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Pierre	She was wise enough to take no notice of the grudging responses and sullen looks that followed her orders, but she knew well enough that feeling ran high against her in the servants’ wing. “Thank you, [MASK]. Yes, I’m very well and happy.
<name>visitors</name>	visitors	Henriette	Well born and prosperous, with tolerance for others yet with the highest of personal standards, he was that rare combination—a minister of the Gospel and a man of the world. He lived simply but with dignity in a large old house where he received [MASK] in his study on more than one occasion.
<name>John</name>	John	Henri	“This is my belief,” she would wind up some devastating comment upon a subject under discussion, “but [MASK] says I do not paint the picture in fairness. He thinks that I mix my colors with prejudice, and it may well be so.”
<name>him</name>	him	Henry	She sat at the edge of that group, yet she did not feel apart from them as she had expected to be. She was proud of [MASK], standing erect in his best black coat with the late afternoon light lending radiance to his face.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Henriette	[MASK] could not suppress a feeling of awe and unbelief as she took it into her own hands. “But it is so little!” she exclaimed. “No, it cannot be possible that this can stand the fury of the sea and the weight of miles of water!”
<name>John</name>	John	Cyrus	[MASK] returned to the city from one of his recent business trips in connection with his project. He looks worn and shows the effects of his grief in the loss of his little boy. His earlier elation has, I notice, settled into a dogged determination.
<name>Kawabata</name>	Kawabata	Raynald	For a moment [MASK] seemed dazzled by the sudden brightness; then, as if some magnet drew him towards it, he stretched a hand to the blossoming tree. In that clear shaft of sunlight he seemed even more fragile.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Henri	“Shucks, that was nothing! Kind of like playing a game nobody but us knew. You certainly made things hum when you got under way. Had me scared for a minute or two there.” “Perhaps [MASK] will think we were wrong to do it.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Henry	They were still engrossed in talk when she returned from the pantry with three small glasses and seed cookies. “About how big will it be?” [MASK] was questioning. “Oh, maybe the size of my fist, maybe smaller.
