<name>Macumazahn</name>	Macumazahn	Goyim	For years his hair stood up in fright when he passed a Catholic church, even in daytime. He remembered his revered grandmother’s exact words: 'The dirty cannibal •«( 96}9»- [MASK] — they even eat their own brothers — the pigs!
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Lowenthal	[MASK] smiled, his thick curly lips and heavy-lidded eyes formed a grin that drew all his features to the center of his face. With relief he seized upon this common sympathy between them, and they spent a profitable few minutes putting the Catholic Church in its place.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Freytag	“How did you come to pick up radical friends?” asked [MASK]. "The only ones I ever saw had dirty fingernails and needed haircuts, and they cadged cigarettes from anybody and then stubbed them out in their coffee cups. Do your radical friends behave like that?”
<name>Eilonwy</name>	Eilonwy	Mary	I know where We may go and where not, please will you not listen to me?" "I will listen, [MASK],” he promised her now. "If you can’t come with me, I will go with you!”
<name>Enjolras</name>	Enjolras	Hansen	Why? Not because he does not like the Church, but because his acts disturb the government. The Church and the government are like that!" [MASK] held up two fingers pressed together. "He could knock down altars all day and who would care?
<name>Woolf</name>	Woolf	Freytag	“He’s an extreme character,” said [MASK]. "Something is troubling him. He groans and yells and thrashes about at night and gets into fearful scrimmages with some enemy who attacks him in that upper berth.”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Lizzi	So you see," she said, sweetly, with satisfaction, "you are in no danger of contamination.” "He told you this himself?” asked [MASK] in a shocked hoarse whisper. "You are on such terms with him? Well!
<name>Wormold</name>	Wormold	Hansen	[MASK] leaned forward, his pale eyes glaring under his knotted ^160^ brows. "Opinions? What opinions? What do they know to have opinions about? Only the fat man has opinions and the Captain says he is to be put in irons ... so much for the right to opinions among those people.”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Denny	She was by now dragging her husband along by the arm, her limp had almost disappeared. Seeing that disreputable young [MASK], the nearest person to her, she forgot all reserve and rushed upon him, close to tears.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	David	We talked a little on deck just now,” he said. “She is delightful.” [MASK] had a singular gift of hardening instantly into silence that extended long after the speaker had ceased to expect an answer, expressing disapproval and disagreement in terms much stronger than words.
<name>John</name>	John	Jenny	"First he is a little better, and then he is worse,” she said in wonder, as if this phenomenon were entirely outside nature. [MASK] showed no surprise but leaned over and patted B6b6 between the ears.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Johann	[MASK], listening in horror, kept turning his head and swallowing as if he were being strangled. He who had so often wished his uncle dead was nearly stunned at the proposal that he should murder him. He could swear that thought had never entered his mind.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Freytag	He’s just a noisy middle-class medical student, he could be a bore, but what's low about him?” "He was dancing with you without respect, as if he were making fun of you,” said [MASK], bluntly.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Lowenthal	Being under compulsion to keep the talk going for the mere look of the thing, he decided he might as well bring the question out in the open. “She belongs to one of the very oldest Jewish families . . .’’ [MASK]’s manner changed again at this.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jenny	He poured another cup of coffee and said, “Let’s drop this subject I’m sick of it already.” [MASK] took a good swig of too hot coffee, gasped a little and said, “You are a monster, did you know that, you monster?"
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Jenny	“Can’t you just be a little flattered if I am jealous? It must be that, don’t you think? Any other explanation of my conduct is silly.” “No, I’m not flattered,” said [MASK], “but do you know what I had in mind?
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Johann	Meanwhile, asleep or not, her neatly rolling little hips kept tireless rhythm, she stepped and swayed and spun in the perfection of her delicate art. Little by little [MASK]’s desperate face smoothed and softened, he rested his cheek on her sleek black hair and danced too with closed eyes.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jenny	[MASK] listened as if hypnotized. The dreamy voice was soothing as a cradlesong, a song her own wishful deluded heart sang to itself. It mingled with the soft dance of light on water and the fresh wind on her face.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Elsa	[MASK] thought this over for a while, then ventured, "But I have always been told that love makes trouble — that is what it is for. Trouble." She drew a deep quivering happy sigh. “I shouldn’t mind!”
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Jenny	He frowned severely, and [MASK] noticed that the more severely he frowned, the more helplessly he blushed with some deep inexpressible embarrassment. “Of course,” said the Captain huffily, “we are all martyrs to our duty, who does not know that?
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	It was true, or had been — it could still be. It was [MASK] herself who made the difference to his whole life, her qualities were changeless, what had possessed him to fall into a fright about their future?
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Jenny	"Go away, gypsy woman,” said [MASK], in English. "You don’t know enough. You’ve got a one-track mind. I don’t want any other man, the very notion gives me the horrors. I’ll stick by the trouble I know.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Freytag	The steward presented him with the appetizer, Westphalian ham folded delicately beside a slice of melon. He shook his head, and the steward asked, “What would you like instead, sir? Smoked salmon? Herring in sour cream?” “Either will do nicely,” said [MASK].
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hans	“Eat your dinner, though, [MASK]," said his mother after a while, “and we shall play some more afterwards.” Her husband disregarded this hint. He pushed the beard up to the middle of his forehead, parted it like a curtain and said “Boo!"
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	"I haven’t the faintest notion what it is,” said [MASK], “but it sounds very attractive.” Her tone did not match her words, and her answer struck him unpleasandy as having a flinty litde edge on it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	B£b£	He did not feel it was unmanly of him to have held [MASK]’s head, but it was careless of him not to have a proper regard for ap- pearances, and to have exposed himself to the ridicule of those coarse-natured persons.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Denny	[MASK] came in, greeted them almost fondly, and sat down with them as if he had been invited. "God, I’m bushed,” he began. “I’ve been nearly all over this island at a dead run.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jenny	Half a dozen Indians, men and women, were standing together quiedy in the bare spot near one of the small houses, and they were watching something very intensely. As the bus rolled by, [MASK] saw a man and a woman, some distance from the group, locked in a death battle.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	But you will go soon to a better country, and you will find your man. You will be happy in love yet, don’t be troubled! Cross my palm with silver!” She held [MASK]’s hand firmly, her eyes were shrewd and impudent, she smiled with her teeth closed.
<name>Gnädige</name>	Gnädige	Dame	She advanced upon the steward firmly though kindly. He was a most polite and attentive fellow who spoke with an Austrian accent . . . "meine [MASK],” he called her, which she rather preferred to the home- <
<name>John</name>	John	David	At last he felt he had something to say to her that she would not be able to answer. Would she dare to say to him again, "It wasn't love, [MASK]—” Well, this time he didn’t care what it was.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Everybody	[MASK] from the Captain's table was there, apparendy unconscious of his existence. Those appalling Spaniards, not even they turned an eye towards him, though one of the girls, the litde young Concha, had been following him about lately, as if she had something on her mind.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Freytag	A few older women, perhaps as much as thirty, still had this beauty of athletes in training— "It would kill two longshoremen in a week,” remarked [MASK], admiringly, after watching them run so endlessly and apparently without effort or fatigue.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hans	And he did a hop-skip-jump sort of dance in a circle. “Rumpelstilzchen!” shouted [MASK], at the top of his voice. “Right!” bawled his father heartily, and they hurried forward, feeling that the party had already begun.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jenny	“Do you suspect me of getting love letters?” she inquired indignandy. Of course not — or rather, well, no. That was not the point. It was just that he could not admit that [MASK] had any privacies he was bound to respect.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	David	But there was nowhere to start, no common ground — their separation had begun, the distance between them had widened without warning. There is no moment of peace, thought [MASK], except in that split second of hope, of belief even, that now, now you have it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Denny	There seemed nothing much wrong with [MASK] except he was a bore. His mind seemed to run monotonously on women, or rather, sex; money, or rather his determination not to be gypped by anybody; and his health.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Lowenthal	"As you please, mein Herr,” he said in a respectful tone, and [MASK] saw the shadow of that look again, undisguised this time — the upper lip curled ever so slighdy, the naturally insolent blue eyes wandering for a second. '
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elsa	She was chilled and pulled on a sweater when she dressed. The ship had crossed some line in the night, it was not summer any more, but early fall. [MASK] opened her eyes and stretched and got up to the porthole to breathe in the dampness with delight.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Jenny	An intense resentment aganst [MASK] rose in him when he saw her at work trying to undermine him, to break down by any means his whole life of resistance to life itself — to whatever environment or human society he found himself in.
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Hansen	"All the claims are just prejudice against prejudice; blind feeling fighting for the upper hand. . . . People love the right to hate each other with moral sanction. The real basis of the religious question is political —” "Just so,” boomed [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Pepe	She saved herself like a miser in the dull plungings and poundings of those men who were her business, and spent herself upon [MASK], who was tricky as a monkey and as coldly long-lasting as a frog.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Mary	He shook his head as if that might scatter his uncomfortable thoughts, and tried to think of [MASK], but the nearer he came to her bodily, the more dimly her image flickered in his mind. What was there to think of?
<name>Katherine</name>	Katherine	David	There is nowhere to go back and begin again with this . . . there is no place to go. The past is never where you think you left it: you are not the same person you were yesterday — oh where did [MASK] go, I wonder?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ric	[MASK] lost his balance and made a scrabbling noise; the girl turned her head and peered toward them without seeing; then she stumbled on the steps and the fat man took her arm. "Careful, my beautiful,” he said softly.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Lizzi	The faces and figures of her fellow passengers, if they could be called that, were all in a muddle with the wrong names attached, and the very thought of them confused and oppressed her mind. [MASK] gossiped about them perpetually, her dreadful voice grating along, with an affected superior little air.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Jenny	His face cleared and a curious thin smile tightened at the comers of his mouth. He drew [MASK] closer to him with a conspiratorial quick gesture of familiarity and put his cheek against hers. "Is he still there? Is he still jealous?
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Denny	[MASK], in the act of swallowing his last mouthful of wine, now choked violently and spewed it back in the air above her head. She was liberally besprinkled, wiped her hair with her paper napkin, and said, with some dignity: "That is not nice.
<name>James</name>	James	Denny	The ladies ignored him; though they paused in their game now and then to sip their pousse-cafds and glance haughtily about the comfortably crowded bar, they never once glanced at [MASK], who felt it as a personal slight.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Lizzi	"At least, they cannot make a dupe of me!" "Do you think I would really go to their low little party?” asked [MASK]. "I gave them the money as I would give it to a beggar.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	David	"I suppose you’re right so far as you go, but there is something else. ... I know I’m much too simple to be a good primitive." "I don’t think they are any more complicated than we are,” said [MASK].
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	David	[MASK] looked at his watch and decided it was time for the first drink of the day, the hour towards which he lived of late, and went in the bar, feeling all at once surrounded and smothered by the sea, which he hated, and which now filled him with a quiet deep horror.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Elsa	“I see that all the drunks and seasicks are up and tottering about,” she said, “even your cabin mates. Do you ever get lonely in there, darling? Ever feel like coming in to spend the night with [MASK] and me?"
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Concha	Slamming the door behind him, he raced back to the deck, his stomach so sunken and tight between fury and terror, his heart pounding so heavily he could hardly hear, his eyes dancing so that he was nearly blinded. Yet he could see [MASK], not clearly, but enough.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hans	He inspected his ingrowing toenail with deep alarm. "Gosh,” he said, "I think this thing is infected!” He forgot everything else in his search for the iodine. Until they came on the ship, [MASK] had never seen his parents dressing and undressing together.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	“Oh, I couldn’t, I’m too lazy.” "They are going to bury that poor drowned man this morning,” said [MASK], “just think of him being left here all by himself.”
<name>Aschenbach</name>	Aschenbach	Jenny	'They are exactly as dangerous as we allow them to be," said [MASK]; "why flatter them? Really all we need to do is watch our pocketbooks. Otherwise they are bores, I think — all that dingy picturesqueness.
<name>Arnall</name>	Arnall	Garza	‘Otherwise in one way and a dangerous way you are yielding to her seductions,’Father [MASK] said. . . He was not consoled or reassured, and knew that he could never be by any means he was able to imagine now.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Doctor	“Maybe I want my bed for myself, [MASK]? Maybe for once I should like to come back somewhere and not find somebody pushing me out? Is there a law saying I shouldn’t have what I paid for?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Hans	Melted with tears and surprised by rising sensuality, they began to fondle not each other but the child between them; their newly roused passion for each other poured back and forth over and through him like a wave. [MASK] threw himself side-wise trying to break out of the prison of their arms.
<name>Mathilde</name>	Mathilde	Lizzi	[MASK] slapped his hand, annoyed, because she had meant to say that herself. “Shame on you," she said, “you are not very kind. Dancing partners are sometimes scarce, one cannot always choose too delicately.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Johann	He motioned towards his bunk. “There," he said, "reach under the mattress, back near the wall, and give me my wallet." [MASK], shocked by this sudden victory, fumbled among the blankets with uncertain hands, ashamed and humbled and resentful.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Lizzi	Slowly, with strangely blissful tears forming under her closed lids, she drifted from her waking dream to quiet sleep. “I can’t see quite why it gets so stuffy in here,” said [MASK], dropping her hairbrush and picking it up. “So sorry.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Denny	Now I go.” [MASK] took her wrist as she stood up and said, desperately, 'Tonight?" "Not tonight,” she said coolly disengaging herself. ‘Tonight, I am tired.’’ ’Tomorrow?" "Maybe. Let my arm go.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Johann	He turned the chair to the rail and stopped to watch the delightful show. "Go on, [MASK],” said his uncle, for the slight joggling of the chair soothed him, and the movement against the wind helped his breathing.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Jenny	I can’t understand people being so hardhearted — they were sweet pictures full of lovely scenes —” "The trouble with those students is simply that they haven’t been born yet,” said [MASK], severely. “They are just their parents’ bad dreams.
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Ric	“Let’s make him get up,” said [MASK], the male twin, and taking off his loose heavy brown sandal, he threw it by the toe. It missed and struck a young woman sitting near with a baby in her arms.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Karl	The same old cry. His face drew together, his mouth twisted and trembled; his bright empty blue eyes grew fierce with suffering. “[MASK], how can it help? Tomorrow it will be the same thing."
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Lola	[MASK] danced grandly and severely, her features fixed in the classic erotic-frowning smile, which fetched forth ritual amorous groans from the males of her assisting company. At her last roulade of clicking heels, the others sprang up.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	David	He won’t even talk about it to me. [MASK] hates love worse than I do, even. You’ve got a roving eye and the sidelong approach. If you belonged to me I wouldn’t trust you any further than I could throw you by the ear.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Elsa	Now, there remains only to get your hair wound up on bobbins, and the next thing you know —” He beamed and wagged a finger at her. “Ah ah now, be careful!” [MASK] smiled in quiet rapture and ate a fine breakfast.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Germans	"I am not responsible for their manners." “You let them insult [MASK] on a German boat, do you? Well, the Captain shall hear of this, we’ll see what he has to say to such goings-on on his ship."
<name>Who</name>	Who	Lola	“But you sound so businesslike, for an artist,” she told him. “How can you be so practical?” *1 am the manager of this company,” he told her, "also die director, and my wife is my assistant” "[MASK]?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Amparo	He found [MASK] brushing her tangled hair, her lipstick badly smeared over her bitten-looking mouth, and the lower berth was in a tumble as usual. "Well?” he said. In sulky silence she nodded backward.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Ldwenthal	He recalled all the queer comic names the Jews made up for each other, names of contempt and ridicule, and the worst of them were meant for fellows like this. [MASK] was looking about him with skeptical eyes, a sour twist on his mouth.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hans	[MASK], his mouth half-open to receive food, stopped and smiled uncertainly; the other little boy laughed in a quavering artificial tone; but the baby girl was too young to pretend anything, and she gazed in growing terror, then burst into tears.
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Hans	That those terrible Spanish children threatened . . "Nonsense,’’ cried his wife, and to [MASK], “What do you mean, running off to play with those children? Haven’t I told you to keep away from them?”
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Elsa	"Oh, I have," said [MASK], rejecting the half-truth and the pity it offered with bitter pride and honesty. "I have ... I think sometimes that if I had different clothes," she said, “or maybe a permanent wave.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nightmare	[MASK] closed around in whirling flame and orange flashes of dreadful shapeless visions with crazed eyes and stretched silendy screaming mouths. He rolled face up and opened his eyes on the low comedy of his surroundings and heard himself say loudly, "I’m ready for the nut-hatch!”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Freytag	They looked a little dull and melancholy in their sullenness, as if their victory had cost more than it was worth, and had exhausted them. [MASK] passed on through the bar without stopping when he saw who was already there: no beer could do him any good in such company.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Denny	The purser, still standing, turned unusually red and swollen in the face and neck and emptied his seidel down his throat as if it were into a drain. ‘To hell with him," said [MASK], sympathetically.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Freytag	She waved him good-by merrily, merrily, both of them laughing, and ran to [MASK]. He favored her with a very German, superior smile, saying: ‘Tell me, you should know this, do all women prefer thugs, and macpiereaux, and guttersnipes at heart?
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Tve	He stripped to the skin and lay down. “You were a good while at it,” he said, “even for the money.” “Let me alone,” she said, ‘[MASK] told you how it is.” “Let you alone?”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Lowenthal	“I hope I am not intruding.” "And could we help it if you were?” asked [MASK], raising his shoulders and eyebrows. “Did anybody ask us?” He did not seem offended, but merely was mentioning an obvious fact.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jenny	“Didn’t your mother tell you that?” "Nobody told me anything that was of the least use,” said [MASK], all at once feeling quite restored and good-humored. "And I wouldn’t have listened if they had."
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Mary	The whole thing from start to finish was his own fault; he could only accept this hard fact, writhing with wounded pride—how could he trust himself for anything if he made such a fool of himself in this matter of his whole life and [MASK]’s?
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Hans	"It’s too late now — everybody has already seen you ... I think I’ll have a beer, too.” [MASK] sat elbows on table, chin in hand, waiting until one or the other of them would remember to ask for his raspberry juice.
<name>Arkady</name>	Arkady	Freytag	But a change for the better, I should say dear sir, even if only superficial, temporary, and for unworthy motives —” “What other kind could they have?” asked [MASK], feeling cheerful all at once.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	David	When [MASK] paused for a second time in another doorway, farther down, he saw them doing a romping improvised dance with long, swooping, drunken steps, both laughing like maniacs. He went back to the bar.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Denny	"Why always ‘dirty’ please,” she said in her light agreeable voice, "and why always ‘Red’ and what do you really know or care about it?" [MASK]’s head rolled a trifle; he stared at her as if he had never seen her before.
<name>Bad</name>	Bad	Tor	She bent over him intendy and struck at his hump cruelly with her sharp fingers. '[MASK] luck, that’s the only thing you’re good for!” she said, then whirled on her heel to join the others, waiting nearby.
<name>Salome</name>	Salome	Lizzi	She swallowed another herself, and smiled delightedly at her hideous wicked face in the looking glass. In her joy and excitement, she snatched off her bloodstained sandal and kissed it Leaning over [MASK] on the divan, who asked dreamily, "What are you doing now?”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hans	How could you think I would hurt you?” [MASK] stiffened and turned his head rigidly from the stink of the breath blown in his nostrils, his mouth tightly closed, feeling with horror his father’s clammy warm tears joining his own on his face.
<name>Archer</name>	Archer	Freytag	[MASK], with the presence of mind of a married man used to feminine emergencies, glanced round to see if any witness had entered the writing room, moved between her and the door to provide a screen, and offered her a large white linen handkerchief.
<name>Cedric</name>	Cedric	Johann	In silence they moved on, the chair creaking faintly. "I forgive you, nephew [MASK], I forgive you your hard heart and evil will. You cannot harm me by any means, but I might help you if you would let me.
<name>Heinrich</name>	Heinrich	Freytag	You are no longer a Jew, but the wife of a German; our children’s blood will flow as pure as mine, your tainted stream will be cleansed in their German veins — [MASK] pulled himself up with a sharp turn, and wiped his streaming face.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ric	A sailor on deck below picked up the sandal and tossed it back so accurately he hit [MASK] in the chest, and almost at the same instant the twins were seized by an arm each from the back, and a stern voice of absolute authority said, "What are you doing here?”
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Jenny	"Of course they will like you, you will be the new interest, the girl from a far country," [MASK] told her, and she felt an anxious tenderness, as if she had been asked for help which she was not able to give.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Jenny	"I wish I could see the brains . . .” "Oh God, what an idea!" "The brain is most beautifully designed,” said [MASK] loftily. “Maybe you would let me try to make some drawings of you?”
<name>Una</name>	Una	Freytag	He saw us last night — saw something that about finished him, I think . . .’’ “So long as he goes prowling and spying on you,” said [MASK], boldly, "anything he sees will be too good for him.”
