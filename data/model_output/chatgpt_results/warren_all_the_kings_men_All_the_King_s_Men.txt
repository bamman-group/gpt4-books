<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Dumonde	“You weren’t like yourself, like you used to be, you—” “If I’m ever like I used to be I’ll shoot myself,” I said, “and if I embarrassed you before those half-wit Pattons and that half-wit [MASK], I’m sorry.”
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Adam	A few paces up the drive she hesitated for me to come abreast of her. Then she took my hand, and that way, hand in hand, we proceeded toward the gallery where back in the shadow [MASK] would be sitting.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Dufly	Because, you see, I know.” “Who?” I demanded. “Who?” And came up out of my chair. “[MASK],” she said. “I knew it!” I exclaimed, “I ought to have known it!
<name>married</name>	married	Governor	It would be a reproach, an affront, a cause for laughter and a thing for tears. Knowing what you knew, you would lie there listening to him getting ready to be [MASK], and want to stuff the pillow slip in your mouth to stop the giggles.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Willie	[MASK] put out his hand and laid it on the flask. “Gimme that thing,” he said. “Go easy,” I said, “you aren’t used to this stuff. You already—”
<name>old sport</name>	old sport	Sadie	Why don’t you tell the big boys it’s no go?” “What put that in your head?” “Listen, [MASK],” I said, “we’ve been pals for a long time and you needn’t lie to uncle.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Anne	The best I could do was to dance with [MASK], who was sweet to me but who, when I kept asking her to slip out with me, said she couldn’t just then, she couldn’t because of the guests and she’d try to later.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Willie	He kept looking desperately toward the band as though he might signal them to burst into music and then at the crowd as though he were trying to think of something to say. Then he edged toward [MASK] and said something to him.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Shucks	I figured you were so beat down you’d know the good Lord never meant for you to be rich. I figured you never would try to pull any shines. [MASK], I figured you didn’t have any more initiative than a wet washrag dropped on the bathroom floor in a rooming house for old maids.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Queequeg	And had sunk her harpoon deeper than ever [MASK] sunk it, through four feet of blubber to the very quick, but I hadn’t really known it until the line played out and the barb jerked in the red meat which was the Me inside of all the blubber of what I had thought I was.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Stark	I looked across the square at the painted clock face on the courthouse tower, which was the clock the old ones kept time by, and waited. Then I said, “What’s stopping ’em?” And Number One: “[MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Anne	I looked at the marks when [MASK] lifted her chin, and realized that I had never noticed them before and would always notice them again. I suddenly felt awful— literally sick, as though I had been socked in the stomach, or as though I had met a hideous betrayal.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Matters	“Distasteful?” I said. “Yes, distasteful. [MASK] came to such a pass that he could not perform happily in his chosen profession. He dreamed of falling every time he went to sleep. And he would wet his bed like a child.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Adam	But at that sound, the first sound of the hand on the knob, he swung his head toward the door and froze in his tracks like a pointer. [MASK] walked into the room into the clutch of that gaze. The Boss licked his lower lip, but he controlled the question.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lois	I put this possibility in the list merely for logical and schematic completeness, for I am quite sure that the only things [MASK] knew about love was how to spell the word and how to make the physiological adjustments traditionally associated with the idea.
<name>Mr. Bell</name>	Mr. Bell	Sadie	I wasn’t, however, looking out over the mist-veiled, romantic, crepuscular city, but was bent over my nice, tidy, comforting tax figures, under a green-shaded light, when die telephone rang. It was [MASK].
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Willie	and I let her cook it. [MASK] kept on looking at her, waiting while she turned to one side and uncorked my bottle and poured herself out a steady-er. She took it, and without any ladylike cough. “Told me what?”Willie said.
<name>Rockefeller</name>	Rockefeller	Gummy	Because it paid. [MASK] had the instincts of a businessman, all right. “I’ll tell you where he is,” the Boss said. “Look, there he is. Right in this room. Standing right there, and look at him.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Sadie	But something had happened. To hell with them all, I thought. I was sick of it all. I looked down at the letter again. So [MASK] had called me an Eagle Scout. But that wasn’t news, either.
<name>Madame Ratignolle</name>	Madame Ratignolle	Cass	[MASK] commented on the sweetness of the scent of jasmine. All at once, she burst out (“her voice low-pitched and with its huskiness, but in a vehemence which astonished me”), “Yes, yes, it is too sweet.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cass	But trouble did come. One of [MASK]’s Negroes had a broad-wife on a plantation near by. After she had had some minor trouble with the overseer, the husband stole her from the plantation and ran away. Toward the Tennessee border the pair were taken.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Irwin	“Listen,” I said, “was [MASK] ever broke, did he ever really need money? Bad?” He stared at me from a long way off, across the distance, beyond the bowl of soup on the floor, over the chocolate in his hand, through time.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Adam	I thought it would bust a gut. But that summer from the height of my Olympian wisdom, I seemed to find a great many things funny which now do not appear quite as funny. After the operation I did not see anything of [MASK] for quite a while.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Gummy	I had to hand it to [MASK]. He didn’t quiver. He had ice water in his veins. Nothing fazed him, not insult or anger or violence or getting his face beat into a hamburger. He was a true businessman. He knew the value of everything.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Tiny	“Thanks,” the Boss said, “you tell him I’ll be over in a minute. Soon as I see the boys run this one over.” And he put his attention on the game. “Hell,” [MASK] began, “I know it ain’t nothing.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	No,’’Tiny	the Boss demanded. “[MASK] said, as from the bottom of a deep well. “I was not,” the Boss said. “I didn’t let him get across that doorsill.” He pointed at the closed door beyond me.
<name>trephine</name>	trephine	Gigli	With that he drilled five or six holes—burr holes they call them in the trade—on each side of the skull. Then he started to work with what he had told me earlier was a [MASK] saw, a thing which looked like a coarse wire.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Anne	But the question kept coming back. Even when I wasn’t thinking of it, I would suddenly be aware of its gnawing like a mouse’s tooth stitching away inside the wainscoting of my mind. For a while I didn’t see how I could ask [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lucy	So I was back in the parlor in the little white house, among the black-walnut furniture upholstered in red plush, looking down at the flowers in the carpet. Nothing had changed in that room for a long time, or would change for a long time. But [MASK] had changed a little.
<name>Senator Proudfit</name>	Senator Proudfit	Tiny	There I went around to the back of the Capitol, where I joined the Boss. Late that night, back at the Mansion, after he had thrown [MASK] and his rabble out of the study, I asked him the question.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Mortimer	Then she stared at me, thrusting her head out suddenly, saying, “I know—I know you—you’re trying to trick me—you’re from the insurance company!” “Wrong number,” I said. “But I know about [MASK]’s insurance policy.
<name>the boat</name>	the boat	Adam	Then it was a driving gust of rain, and the surface of the water was gone. We rose out of the water and stood on the sand, with the rain whipping our skin, and looked out at [MASK], who was coming in.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Jack	Was I?Tell me, [MASK]!” I looked down at her. “No,” I said, “you weren’t horrible.” “But it has happened to me. It has all happened to me. And he’s gone.”
<name>Tick</name>	Tick	Duffy	I ran out of the place. And three days later, after he died, I came here. It was the only place I could come.” “Well, thanks anyway,” I said. “I reckon we can stop [MASK]’s clock.”
<name>Springsteen</name>	Springsteen	Willie	“You tell ’em, [MASK]!” somebody yelled back in the crowd. Then they started to laugh. The Boss lifted up his right hand about as high as his head, out in front of him, palm down, and waited till they stopped laughing and whistling.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Anne	So now [MASK] was an old maid living in the city, and even if she did look pretty good yet and wore clothes that didn’t hurt her any, her laugh was getting brittle and there was a drawn look on her face as though she were trying to remember something.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Adam	The dark hair drawn smoothly, almost tautly, away from the accurate part. The blue eyes which looked at you like [MASK]’s eyes, with the same directness, but in which the clear, abstract, ice-blue was replaced by a deeper, coiling, troubled blue.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Lucy	But you can tell this, if any man tried to run things the way they want him to half the time, he’d end up sleeping on the bare ground. And how would she like that?” “I imagine [MASK] could take it,” I said.
<name>he</name>	he	Tom	He didn’t knock, but walked straight into the Boss’s office. I retreated to my own office and waited for the dust to settle. Whatever it was, [MASK] was not going to stand and take it, not even from the Boss.
<name>Samson</name>	Samson	Samson	They love him because they— women, I mean—are like the bees in [MASK]’s parable in the Bible: they like to build their honeycomb in the carcass of a dead lion. Out of the strong shall come forth sweetness.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Tiny	[MASK] got to his feet. He opened his mouth several times, wet his lips, and seemed about to speak, but each time the now gray face closed back up over the expensive bridgework. The Boss went up to him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	There might be a flicker of that left the next morning when he opened the Sunday sporting page, but it certainly didn’t last out the week. And [MASK] was not doing a thing to make up to the old man for the trouble he had caused.
<name>she</name>	she	Lucy	“Sort of break it to her easy,” he said. “You know—sort of build her up for it.” I said I would, and left. It sounded pretty bad if [MASK] had to have all that build-up.
<name>he</name>	he	Adam	And laughed. And she laughed, too, with pleasure, and everything was forgotten, for it wasn’t often that [MASK] opened up and laughed a lot, and then he could be free and gay, and you knew you would have a wonderful time.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Jack	In, of course—” and he grinned—“a reasonable time.” Then he looked over at me and said, “Let’s haul ass, [MASK],” and started on down toward the front door, out of sight.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Cass	[MASK] described her that way. He admitted that her face was not beautiful. “Though agreeable in its proportions,” he added. But the hair was beautiful, and “of an astonishing softness, upon your hand softer and finer than your thought of silk.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Jack	ing and his face all white and drawn. Oh, [MASK]—” she grabbed my arm again, and shook me as though I were holding back an answer—“why won’t he do it? Why is he this way? Doesn’t he see he ought to?
<name>Twain</name>	Twain	Cass	I offer my congratulations.” So [MASK] put his free Negroes on a boat bound upriver, and never heard of them again. “I saw the boat head out into the channel, and watched the wheels churn against the strong current, and my spirit was troubled.
<name>Pop</name>	Pop	Tiny	You are a funny old fat man, [MASK], with your heart getting bad and your liver nigh gone and sweat running down your face and a mean worry on your mind and a great blackness like water rising in a cellar inside you and I almost feel sorry for you
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gummy	Way back in the old days, when I had first known [MASK] and he had been a gambling-house operator, the police had beat him up one time. Probably because he got behind in his protection money. They had worked over his face until it looked like uncooked hamburger.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Duffy	Take your rabble over to the other side of the house and stay out from under foot.” Then in the silence of his pause his eyes flickered over the faces again, to come back to [MASK]. To whom he said, “You think you grasp the idea?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Adam	“Good,” the Boss said, “good,” and clenched his hands as though he had tried to grasp some substance which had faded at his touch and dissolved to air. “I would advise it,” [MASK] said quietly, almost softly.
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	George	Stupid— I’m an old man and I forget—” and clucking and muttering and shaking his head in that same fretful fashion he poured some soup into a bowl, took a spoon, and went to [MASK].
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jack	And, [MASK], you—” “Yeah?” I asked. “You’re going to get him.” I disengaged myself from the grasp on my lapel, straightened it, and dropped into a chair. “Get who?” I asked.
<name>Bruce</name>	Bruce	Willie	I had seen that picture in a thousand places, pool halls to palaces. Somebody back in the crowd yelled, “Hi, [MASK]!” The Boss lifted his right hand and waved in acknowledgment to the unknown admirer.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sadie	For I got me a gospel and I—” I leaned to [MASK]. “Listen,” I said, “I’ve got to get on a telephone. I’m starting to town or the first telephone I hit. I got to telephone this in.
<name>Judas</name>	Judas	Gummy	Oh, [MASK] would sell out anything. He sold out his best pal, and I—and I—” he struck himself savagely on the chest with a hollow sound like a thump on a barrel—“and I—I had to buy, the sons-of-bitches made me buy!”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Adam	“Are you sure, [MASK]?” I said. “Are you sure?” “Damn it—” he began, and the blood was up in his cheeks. “He knows what you want,” I cut in.
<name>Franklin</name>	Franklin	Cass	[MASK] remarked in the journal that trouble might have been avoided if he had been more careful to speak in private, but he wrote that at the time the matter was so much upon his mind that the men who stood about were as shadows to him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Willie	“Nothing,” I said, “except [MASK] here is saying how he’s not going to be Governor.” She had the match lighted by the time I got the words out, but it never got to the cigarette. It stopped in mid-air.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Sadie	[MASK] would treat the Boss with an icy decorum, meeting him only and strictly in the course of business, standing quietly before him while he talked. She would stand there before him and study him out of the black eyes, in which the blaze was banked now.
<name>Stonewall Jackson</name>	Stonewall Jackson	Cass	Fools not to temporize now and. if they must, prepare themselves to strike a blow. I have told responsible men to prepare. All fools.” To which [MASK] replied: “I pray much for peace.”
<name>Governor</name>	Governor	George	“And drive business out of this state. Raising royalty on the state coal land. On the oil land. On—” “Yes, [MASK],” the Judge laughed, “and he slammed an income tax on you and me, too.”
<name>Crooks</name>	Crooks	Yassuh	“[MASK].” “Where, dammit?” the Boss snapped. “You think I’m asking for my health?” “New, suh, I didn’t think nuthin, I—” “Where?” the Boss demanded in a tone to set the chandelier tingling.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Willie	Or one of them presses his finger on the trigger, and the sound of the gun surprises even him. [MASK] is up there. In the sun, or in the red light of the gasoline flare. “You ask me what my program is.
<name>John</name>	John	Flee	And kept on moving west. For West is where we all plan to go some day. It is where you go when the land gives out and the old-field pines encroach. It is where you go when you get the letter saying: [MASK], all is discovered.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	George	“[MASK],” the Judge said, “you’re an old fogy. Government is committed these days to give services we never heard of when we were growing up. The world’s changing.” “It’s changed so much a fellow can step in and grab the whole state.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Jack	You’re so jumpy and touchy, [MASK].” She laid her hand on my arm, on the rail, and patted me, and I felt the head of steam in me drop a few pounds of pressure. “If he can’t take care of himself, then you—” I began.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jack	“Now?” I demanded, “what about now?” “Now, too. [MASK], I guess I could do it now, too. But it’s different, too.” “Different?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tiny—“you	But you-—” and he snapped out a forefinger at [MASK]—” “I thought—” “You thought you’d trick me—trick me into buying him. Well, I’m not buying him. I’m going to bust him.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Tom	Said she had a headache. I go upstairs and there is [MASK] sitting in the room across from her room doing his schoolwork. Before I lay hand to the knob of her door, he comes out and says, ‘She don’t want to be bothered.’
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Adam	I could have been [MASK]’s assistant. I could have studied landscape gardening. I could have—” “You could make lampshades,” I said. “I could have done something—something—” “You could have got married,” I said.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Sadie	But she had been sitting in the dusk, in the abandoned office, on Saturday evening when everybody else was out having a hell of a good time, with her head laid on her arms on the desk. “Hello, [MASK],” I said.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	George	He fished out, finally, a bar of chocolate, somewhat wilted from the heat, and began to peel back the sticky tinfoil. The last tears were running down [MASK]’s cheeks, while he watched the process, with his mouth open in damp and happy expectation.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lucy	He was, apparently, taking a relish in using the name now, in saying [MASK] instead of she, as though he proved something about something, or about her, or about himself, by saying it, by being able to say it.
<name>Clarisse</name>	Clarisse	Willie	“Sit down, [MASK],” she said, very quietly, “sit down and rest.” He sank down into the chair. She turned away and went back to her own chair. He was looking at her, not at the artificial logs now.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Tiny	And it’s too damned bad. [MASK]. And do you know why?” “Look here!” he said with authority. “Look here, you can’t be—'’ “It’s too bad because I do know something. I know a lot.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Adam	But I just thought you might want to know something about mine. Since we’re going to do business together.” “I am going to run the hospital,” [MASK] said, and added with curling lip, “If you call that doing business together.”
<name>Ina</name>	Ina	Lucy	[MASK] wiped the perspiration-soaked wisp of hair back from her face, and gave that last-minute look around the table to see if anything was missing, like a general inspecting troops. She was in her element, all right.
<name>Stephen's</name>	Stephen's	Anne	We ran up the right-hand sweep of the twin flights of steps leading to die gallery, then safe under the gallery roof began to stamp and shake the water from us like dogs. The running and stamping and the wet had made [MASK]’s hair come loose.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Lucy	and I knew that. But as soon as the name [MASK] was mentioned, to take the place of that she, somehow it was different. It was as though she had walked into the room, and looked at us.
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Cass	[MASK] found the main door unlocked at the house, entered the hall, saw no one, but heard laughter from above. He mounted the stairs and discovered, at the end of the hall, a small group of men gathered at an open door.
<name>Yul Brynner</name>	Yul Brynner	Tom	“What’s his name?” I asked. She straightened up and came around to my side of the crib. “At first,” she said, “I thought I’d name him for [MASK]. I thought that for quite a while.
<name>God</name>	God	Jack	I might as well not have been there. “He was a great man,” she affirmed again, in a voice nearly a whisper. Then she looked again at me, calmly. “You see, [MASK],” she said, “I have to believe that.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	Finally, the eyes turned toward me again, very slowly, and I almost thought that I could hear the tiny painfhl creak of the balls in their sockets. But the light flickered up again. He said, “It might have been all different, [MASK].”
<name>bigger</name>	bigger	Einstein	You and me.” “I hope you don’t mean that as a compliment,” she said. “No, just a scientific observation.” “Well, it don’t make you any [MASK].”
<name>Red</name>	Red	Casey	It was hell among the yearlings and the Charge of the Light Brigade and Saturday night in the back room of [MASK]’s saloon rolled into one, and when the smoke cleared away not a picture still hung on the walls. And there wasn’t any Democratic party.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Adam	Finding somebody in a city if you can’t call in the cops is quite an undertaking. I had tried it often enough back when I was a reporter, and it takes luck and time. But one rule is always to try the obvious first. So I went to [MASK]’s apartment.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Anne	I wondered if [MASK] had seen the gull. When I looked at her, her eyes were closed. Her arms were still spread out wide, and her hair wavered out free on the water from around her head. Her head was far back, her chin lifted.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Jack	“[MASK],” he said, “politics is always a matter of choices, and a man doesn’t set up the choices himself. And there is always a price to make a choice. You know that. You’ve made a choice, and you know how much it cost you.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Sadie	“[MASK],” I said, “you know damned well they’d have to barbecue the great woolly mastodon and use ten-dollar bills instead of lettuce on the buns. Why don’t you tell the big boys it’s no go?”
<name>Rambo</name>	Rambo	President	He’s gonna be [MASK]. He’s gonna kill people with his bare hands. Oh, my God!” She took a drag on her cigarette and spewed the smoke out and then fanned the backwash away from her face with a savage, slapping motion of her right hand.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Adam	“That man, that man,” I mimicked, “that’s what all the people round here call him, what that Patton calls him, all those people who got pushed out of the trough. Well, he does something. He does as much as [MASK].
<name>Wolfsheim</name>	Wolfsheim	Adam	It simply looked tired, tired and not giving a damn. “I found out one thing,” I continued. “A man called up [MASK] that afternoon and told him about the Boss and his sister. And some more stuff. You can guess what stuff.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Adam	It’s all the time [MASK] can spare. And he can’t spare that much often now.” So I had come, carrying my question. I heard the match rasp, and turned from the sea, which was dark now.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jack	You’ve got to tell him that. You know why I did everything I did, you know what happened. Oh, [MASK]—” and she grabbed my sleeve and hung on, “it wasn’t like that. It wasn’t horrible like that.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Adam	“It’s [MASK].” “Now why do I find him? What’s happened?” “He came here and said it was all because of me. Of what I had done.” “What was because of what you had done?”
<name>she</name>	she	Sadie	You asked him.” “I’m un-asking him,” the Boss replied. “Clear ’em all out.” “It’ll be a privilege,” [MASK] said, and I reckoned she spoke from the heart. She cleared them out, and fast.
<name>Friend</name>	Friend	Jack	You know that. You’ve made a choice, and you know how much it cost you. There is always a price.” “Yes, but—” “[MASK], I’m not criticizing you,” he said. “I trust you.
<name>whiskey</name>	whiskey	Upton	She didn’t even turn her head. I went to the door, and out, and the last I heard she was defining what kind of a sap he was. I figured that that might take anybody some time. I took in a good deal of [MASK] that night.
