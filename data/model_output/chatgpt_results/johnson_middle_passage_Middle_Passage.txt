<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Meadows	I tossed it to one of the children in a jolly boat, then put down my kid (eating tub), and stood to the sound of sudden growling behind [MASK]’s legs. He’d brought one of the dogs with him, a half-starved mongrel who apparently wanted something dark to chew on.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Cringle	In a kind of daze I done what he wanted, standin’ back from meself, then unstringin’ him, and it was in a daze that I lay back, short-winded and watchin’ the Africans cut away [MASK]’s head, hands, feet, and bowels, and throw ’em overboard.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Cringle	He was lost to us. “You can belay that kind of talk,” said [MASK], buttoning his coat up on the boy. “I take it you’ve work to do, so be at it. Prompt, if you please.”
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Falcon	Closing his door I bent down on all fours and began feeling with the tip of my knife for the hair-thin wires closest to the entrance. And then suddenly I could not breathe. I felt caged. Wrong if I did as the first mate asked. Wrong if I sided with [MASK].
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Jackson	“Oh, yes, of course,” said [MASK]. “I’ve thought about it, sir. There’s so much my people need.” “There’s a lot / need,” I said.
<name>Polish</name>	Polish	Allmuseri	Quiet and cunning, I’d say, because he was studying everything—everything—we did, and even enlisted my aid in teaching him a smattering of English and explaining how the steerage worked, in exchange for his teaching me [MASK].
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Jonah	Even so, the slaves still lay in a foot of salt water in a hold blacker than the belly of [MASK]’s whale, forced below by the boatswain’s cat-o’-nine-tails. Some rested on the laps of others, down there in scummy darkness foul with defecation, slithering with water snakes.
<name>Bonnet</name>	Bonnet	Ngonyama	Thrown open by deckwash blue as floodwater, the cabin door banged loudly against the wall. The storm outside, for certainly it was that, changed pressure inside the cabin and further troubled my breathing. I lay eager to question [MASK] again, and lifted my head when I heard footsteps enter the room.
<name>Friday</name>	Friday	Diamelo	“Ah was the one signaled her. I cried, ‘Ho there, the ship, ahoy,’ then [MASK] stopped me with a cat. He’s afraid she’s a man-o’-war that’ll put the blacks back in irons. Things are bad.
<name>Baleka</name>	Baleka	Diamelo	(But I must add he kept us alive by not telling [MASK] all he had learned at the helm.) It all had to do with an old Allmuseri belief (hardly understood by one Westerner in a hundred) that each man outpictured his world from deep within his own heart.
<name>The Judge</name>	The Judge	Cringle	“On your feet, you,” [MASK] ordered, and I obeyed because of all the faces present his seemed the most sympathetic. In other words, his was the only one not pitted by smallpox, split by Saturday night knifescar, disfigured by Polynesian tattoos, or distorted by dropsy.
<name>Hanzi</name>	Hanzi	Ngonyama	It consisted of pictograms. You had to look at the characters, [MASK] taught me, as you would an old friend you’ve seen many times before, grasping the meaning— and relation to other characters—in a single intuitive snap.
<name>Shylock</name>	Shylock	Fenton	And that li’l moneylender [MASK]—you know him?” I bobbed my head. “I own him too, so you might as well say I’m the one holdin’ the bad paper, promises, and IOUs that you been handin’ out like flyers.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Squibb	I didn’t know that until the skipper brought them on board. Hell, [MASK], he could be from their tribe, for all I know.” “That’d make you one of ’em too, wouldn’t it?” This I doubted.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	McGaffin	“We need every man we have here.” “Do we now?” [MASK] paused with the mug just below his mouth. “Every man, I’ll agree, but this one ain’t no sailor, he’s a stowaway, remember? A workaway.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	McGaffin	No less than the blacks in the hold these sea-toughened killbucks were chattel. [MASK]’s gaze drifted to my left hand. “That queer ring he’s wearin’, d’you see it? I only seen one like it afore.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Squibb	“And yuh’re goin’ in there with them swabs by yuhself, mate?” “Aye, but I’d appreciate your staying close by and keeping a bright lookout.” With his good arm, [MASK] gave a mock salute.
<name>Ayurvedic</name>	Ayurvedic	Allmuseri	In addition to this, he forbade us to sing songs in English, his oppressor’s tongue, whilst we worked. He said we must learn their stories. Nurture their god. [MASK] medicine was to be used to treat sickness and injuries.
<name>Kid</name>	Kid	Illinois	“Better yuh keep your noodle down, [MASK].” He was instantly sober, his grip on me tight as a winch. “Or yuh’ll be sold too. Stolen right off ship, I’m sayin’, and pressed into a gang.
<name>Zarathustra</name>	Zarathustra	Illinois	“Yer a strange one, [MASK]. Naw, darlin’, I can’t say better.” He laughed suddenly, but with little humor. “Ask my wives—all five of ’em—and they’d probably say I’m worse for it.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Falcon	From the pocket of my breeches I withdrew a few loose crumbs of hardtack and the key I hoped might open their chains. Like a magnet, it had clung to my palm when I lifted [MASK]’s tray from his table the night before. “Here,” I said.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Josiah	“[MASK],” he sniffed. Then answered: “Yes?” “If yuh wants respect, darlin’, yuh got to leave the ruddy cup alone, yes yuh do. Yuh wants ’em to respect yuh now, don’t yuh?”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Squibb	They skinned him and cut the meat into spareribs, fatback, bacon, and ham. It was then I reckon it hit me, that I’d killed a man.” [MASK]’s eyes darted toward the cabin door, as if the mate’s ghost might be standing there.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Squibb	Rags of gray vapor played round the topmost spars. Sitting on a crate beside [MASK] and me, the mate shivered and pulled his peacoat close around him. He was jumpy from lack of sleep, his face ashen. “Mark my words, all of you.
<name>he</name>	he	Ngonyama	“We’ll be all right,” I said, though I didn’t believe a word and was troubled by what [MASK], that crafty bastard, had told me, and furious at the cryptic tone he used sometimes.
<name>she</name>	she	Isadora	Her model, now that I think about it, was a temptress in a play we had seen a year ago, and as [MASK] tried to imitate that actress’s come-hither expression I could only answer by covering my lips to smother a sudden urge to laugh.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	lissen	“All right, [MASK]. Let me put my cards on the table. I made a mistake. Anybody kin do that, right? At first I didn’t know that ship was carryin’ anything more’n vegetables and hides. You got my word on that.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Isadora	Darkness was coming on, the sea trembled as evening shaded down gently over far-reaching waves. I took a breath, then knocked, and [MASK] called out, “Come in. It’s unlocked.” Anger flared in me again. Hadn’t
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Isadora	“Why are you doing this?” Bareheaded like that, with hair swinging in her eyes, the change came over [MASK], a collapsing of her lips inward against her teeth, the blood rising to her cheeks as if I’d suddenly struck her.
<name>Black Dog</name>	Black Dog	Squibb	“Much obliged ... [MASK], is it?” I took his flagon in my left hand and his thick, rough hand in my right. “You’ve put away quite a lot. A man would think you’re going to a hanging, friend.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Fletcher	“Aye, but—” Before I could finish, [MASK] shoved me aside, behind the door, which saved me when he lurched toward the cabinet, caught his foot on a wire no more than an inch from the floor, and set off two explosions fainter than the pop of firecrackers.
<name>Mr. Nancy</name>	Mr. Nancy	Fiftyish	[MASK], a brown-skinned black man with gray-webbed hair, he dressed in rich burgundy waistcoats and had a princely, feudal air about him, the smell of a man who loved Gothic subterfuges and schemes, deceits, and Satanic games of power.
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Falcon	Like so many others with a seaworthy ship and crew of grumbling tars disillusioned by their country’s inability to keep the seas free from piracy and British impressment, [MASK] turned to piracy himself, then to a contraband market that many these days served clandestinely.
<name>they</name>	they	Ngonyama	They could not steal. They fell sick., it was said, if they wronged anyone. As I live, they so shamed me I wanted their ageless culture to be my own, if in fact [MASK] spoke truly. But who was I fooling?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cringle	“You’re the one who kin stow it, [MASK]—or shove it mebbe, and that self-servin’ rummy Falcon too, cose water was me woman before you was in long pants, and I know trouble when I see it. Them niggers is weird.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Calhoun	Could you say that, [MASK], if someone—a nameless benefactor, say—was to come up with the currency to reward you for such a tirin’ public speech?” While he talked I opened the logbook you presently hold in your hands.
<name>Mr. Wolf Larsen</name>	Mr. Wolf Larsen	Calhoun	“That’s how worldly things work, [MASK]. The Social Wheel, as I unnerstand it after forty years in business for myself, is oiled by debts, each man owing the other somethin’ in a kinda web of endless obligations.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Diamelo	[MASK] wants to fire on her, then abandon this tub—and us—fer that one. Y’know, I’d say that boy’s a li’l slack in the stays ...” “No question, but has he convinced the others to become corsairs too?”
<name>Dr. Livesey</name>	Dr. Livesey	Squibb	His head was full of bald patches, the remaining tufts of brown hair being starched, bleached, and brittle. [MASK] diagnosed his affliction first as typhus, then scabies, and finally as sea scurvy. Actually, it was all three. His legs were swollen.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Squibb	“Yuh wanna carry this fish ’n’ tayters over to him?” [MASK] wiped his fingers down the front of his apron. “If yuh’re in with them others now, I guess bringin’ his chow’d give yuh a chance to look his cabin over a little.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Nossir	Nowadays when I kick a swab’s shins he seldom walks again. I advise you to fix yourself a pair of such useful boots for the voyage back. Have you got a pistol?” “[MASK].” “Then we must find one for you.”
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Ngonyama	Not so with [MASK]. “This evil is visited upon us,” he said testily, stepping over his injured tribesmen, giving them water, which we had to ration closely, “for the crewmen we killed.”
<name>Lenny</name>	Lenny	Santos	If anyone knew the untapped power in [MASK]’s top-heavy body, it was the man who had hired him. He never got sick, couldn’t get drunk, no matter how he tried, and had such a high tolerance of pain he often injured himself accidentally.
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Cap’n	Preposterous! Considering thoughts of this sort was like standing on the edge of a cliff. “[MASK],” I said, swallowing, “you’ve got a god on ship?” “You shouldn’t goggle,” says he.
<name>Mosey</name>	Mosey	Chandler	There was something in this, and the way he canted his head, that reminded me so of how my brother sometimes stood alone on the road leading to [MASK]’s farm after our father left, looking. Just looking.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Calhoun	Do you see that, [MASK]?” “Yessir.” I nodded. “Thank you, sir.” “Good.” After toweling his hands, he took a shirt with frills down the front and a pair of pantaloons from a chest by the door.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Jackson	No, he’d cut and run. I know [MASK] pondered long on this dilemma: Stay in slavery to serve those closest to you or flee. Run or do your best in a bad situation. To his credit, he stayed, thereby assuring me of having some family.
<name>but</name>	but	Rutherford	He shot me a stare so fierce, like sparks from a blacksmith’s forge, that I had to look away. “Who else is there to blame? All well and good for you to blink at sin, [MASK]. You’re a Yankee.”
<name>the captain</name>	the captain	Falcon	None of the Africans who went alow had been with it for more than fifteen minutes. None had taken food. It was a duty I dreaded. Still, I felt compelled to see what sort of cargo [MASK] had believed would make his fortune shoreside and, just maybe, hasten the millennium.
<name>mermaid</name>	mermaid	Odysseus	And she, so much slimmer—pulling the gown over her head—was to me a figure of such faint-inducing grace any [MASK] would have swallowed the ocean whole, if need be, to swim to her side.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Squibb	As our mates perished, [MASK] was pressed into service not only as the ship’s cook but also as our surgeon, and was often obliged to search his rum-pickled memory for nautical knowledge when a helmsman was needed.
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Falcon	However it may be, I outlined the mutineers’ plan to deep-six him, citing each rebel by name, and described the central role they had assigned me in the takeover, the whole account spilling from me in fits and starts, for I feared [MASK]’s Jovian wrath more than theirs.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Rutherford	“You’d do well, you young reprobate, to end this light-minded life you’ve been leading and improve yourself by listening to your brother’s counsel. He is wise for his years. Wealth, you know, isn’t what a man has, but what he is, [MASK].
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Cringle	But [MASK] kept his distance; the competition to prove the purity of one’s gender, I’m guessing, made him uncomfortable, even melancholy, and this cost him the respect of the others, who claimed the mate, at age twenty-nine, was a virgin.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Falcon	A soft burp forced its way to his lips. The hounds quieted some, leaving a silence in which I could hear only whimpering and [MASK]’s voice, as he leaned toward me, beckoning with one crooked finger that I tip my head toward his own.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Rusty	Things were not progressing as smoothly as they were supposed to. (“Your elbow’s in my eyeball,” said I; “Sorry,” said she; “Hold on, I think I’ve got a charley horse.”) I was out of practice. [MASK].
<name>Blackbeard</name>	Blackbeard	Squibb	I took his flagon in my left hand and his thick, rough hand in my right. “You’ve put away quite a lot. A man would think you’re going to a hanging, friend.” “Worse,” said [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	McGaffin	“[MASK] was right. I don’t belong here. Like my other appointments, this one was ... arranged.” “For what purpose?” “Not mine, I assure you. If I understand his reasoning, it’s because I’ve made a bad show of everything else.
<name>Mr. Burns</name>	Mr. Burns	Cringle	“Steady up there,” said [MASK] icily when he overheard them. “And you can stow that kind of talk right now. The captain says he’ll haze any man that tries to leave the ship.”
<name>joke</name>	joke	Squibb	(And some of these, I must confess, weren’t all that bad, even memorable, such as one [MASK] told one night. Q: What’s the difference between a dog and a fox? A: About four drinks.)
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Rutherford	I’ve been holding him at bay, really I have, [MASK], for weeks. He hates animals, you know, even though he maintains a few as bodyguards and personal friends. He says I’ll have to get rid of my cats.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Cringle	“Yes.” “Liar,” said he. “Doesn’t matter, though. We’ve all gotten used to the taste of maggots in everything.” At the captain’s door, which had three bullet holes in it, [MASK] tried the latch.
<name>Daggoo</name>	Daggoo	Nacta	As my sight sharpened, I saw through the curtains of smoke a squat, broad-shouldered slave named [MASK], who sprang toward me, cleaving the air with a marlinespike. A foot from my head he checked his swing. His chest was heaving.
<name>Bath</name>	Bath	Bath	Never in my life had anyone loved me so selflessly, as the hag in the Wife of [MASK]’s Tale had loved her fickle knight, but despite this remarkable love, I was not, as I say, ready for marriage.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Falcon	[MASK] wet his hands, then finger-combed his hair, shook off the water, and carried his basin to the door, throwing it out on a man who began cursing like ... well, like a sailor until he saw the captain’s face, and meekly tipped his hat.
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Jackson	As a boy I’d never had enough of anything. Yes, my brother [MASK] and I lived close to our master, but on the Makanda farm during the leaner years, life was, as old bondwomen put it, “too little too late.”
<name>Captain Ahab</name>	Captain Ahab	Rutherford	Don’t plead for him, [MASK].” His shoulders drew in. “It would be a sin to let him live. He is responsible for every death on board.” “That’s a lie!”
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Rutherford	“My goodness, you have changed, [MASK].” “Aye, and what I’m saying is that in order to raise her I shall need your help.” “Is that a proposal?” “It is.”
<name>Mrs. Pearson</name>	Mrs. Pearson	Maud	“Pardon me, sir, but that’s Nature, yuh know. A man shouldn’t keep it inside, and that. ’Tain’t healthy, me wife [MASK] used to say. It’s bad for the heart, she says.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Diamelo	“If he doesn’t, I’ll drag him to the rail myself.” [MASK] took a step toward me. He rubbed his finger, very dark, along my face, which was a shade or two lighter than his own. “Do it now.”
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Josiah	I felt perfectly balanced crosscurrents of culture in him, each a pool of possibilities from which he was unconsciously drawing, moment by moment, to solve whatever problem was at hand. “[MASK], that ship ...” “Ah was the one signaled her.
<name>Long John Silver</name>	Long John Silver	Falcon	I could express this fear to no one, and I beg you to keep it to yourself. His courtship of me, for so it must be called, began the night [MASK] caught me rummaging through his cabin. This was not an easy situation to explain away.
<name>he</name>	he	Diamelo	I worry less about your captain now than how [MASK] can sway my people.” Once outside, as we made our way down the ladder to the storeroom, the mate, who was above me, looked down and sneered, “Savages!
<name>Uncle Randolph</name>	Uncle Randolph	Falcon	[MASK] saw my bewilderment, growled something under his breath, a barely audible oath about philistines; then he opened a bureau with swinging brass handles and lifted out a Tyrian robe of Chinese design. He fumbled into it, rolled the sleeves to his elbows, then came tripping back to me.
<name>the captain</name>	the captain	Falcon	They were common folk. Most could not read, in contrast to [MASK], a polyhistor who spent twenty hours a week pouring over old tomes when the weather was fair—this, because as captain he could not bear having anyone, especially his first mate, correct him.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Cringle	“Poor bastards,” said [MASK], seeing me squeezing my fists and unable to swallow. “Their villages were destroyed by famine.” He banged his large calabash pipe on the Bible he carried, bound in pressed pigskin, to shake loose the dottle.
<name>Black Jack</name>	Black Jack	Nacta	I gave you at the fort?” I held up my left hand. “Give it to me, please.” He waited, pensive, staring past me to [MASK]’s back in the doorway, his features like fog, remembering his nightmarish dream of things to come.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Fletcher	“All right. If that’s how you want it. But I don’t see nobody volunterin’ to put him in that launch.” [MASK] turned his head away; a few others looked at the floor.
<name>Swahili</name>	Swahili	Bushman	His face was blank as a pan. And his words, as his mouth spread and closed like a fish’s, were strange: a slabber of Bantu patois, [MASK], Cushitic, and Sudanic tongues, and your guess where he learned them is as good as mine.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cringle	D’you have enough skin for it? Cose if you’re too fish-hearted to do what you promised, some of us who’ve had enough will do it. See if we don’t!” [MASK] could not reply. This list of problems stole the mate’s wind.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Illinois	“Kin yuh stand, [MASK].'1” I pushed myself up. “Help me get dressed.” “No time fer modesty. We’ve got to use this storm as cover till we gets a boat over the side.” “How many are left?”
<name>Musashi</name>	Musashi	Calhoun	Big as he was, the man was preparing his face to cry over this betrayal. “What was that name you used, [MASK]? All—museri? My grand-daddy use to call hisself that.”
<name>the watch</name>	the watch	Meadows	I saw he was sweating. The armpits of his coat were stained, which was odd. Things were cooler now at eight bells and, since [MASK] had left the pens, quiet but for an occasional cough and the sound of the ocean, spongelike in the way it
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rutherford	“Is that a proposal?” “It is.” “Then I’m sorry, [MASK].” She lowered her eyes, her hand left mine, and for a moment I felt like a ship unmoored. “I can’t accept your proposal now.”
<name>Ahab</name>	Ahab	Squibb	[MASK] handles the crew as before, but no one is to feed the new cargo, or come near it, except me.” “No? Might I ask what it eatr?” “Don’t ask,” says he.
<name>Toussaint</name>	Toussaint	Diamelo	Little of this lasted, except for each of them going below to feed their god. On both sides, African and American, survivors of the revolt felt too battered to embrace an entirely new regime. When [MASK] offered his proposal, they voted with their feet.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ngonyama	[MASK] said, “Thank you.” Then he took me to one side and told me to bring up any mates who had fled to the storeroom, his face older-looking now, grave, his shoulders giving way to gravity or the crunch of some secret grief he could not share.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Baleka	“There’s a big room on the ship. He was going there.” “Can you show me the way?” It was now [MASK] who skiflled me along the well-scrubbed deck, but I soon slowed, weaving from the bite of cold wind.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Squibb	so I kin do right by her this time.” I left him still mumbling into his cup, and [MASK], I’m sure, didn’t notice my absence for an hour. But what he’d said stuck to me like a barnacle.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Isadora	“Bring them here.” I sat down beside her, kissed the cheek she turned up toward me, then sat twiddling my thumbs. Meanwhile, [MASK] took a whiff of the flowers strong enough to suck a few petals into her nose.
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	Chandler	Nor was I eager to look into [MASK]’s face as the light there flimmered, then failed. His chin hung like a turkey wattle. His mouth was fishlike, all collops and pleats, caved in, his dry lips sunk inward as if his gums had grown together.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ngonyama	From the perspective of the Allmuseri the captain had made [MASK] and his tribesmen as bloodthirsty as himself, thereby placing upon these people a shackle, a breach of virtue, far tighter than any chain of common steel. The problem was how to win without defeating the other person.
<name>Shelby</name>	Shelby	Cap’n	“Yessir, and fine boots they are, [MASK].” “Naw, you don’t truly see ’em, boy.” He lifted one foot, pointing the toe toward me. “You’re not supposed to! That’s the point of boots like these.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Squibb	[MASK] nodded. “Yuh think ’bout him a lot, don’tcha?” “Too much. And each time it’s different. I go over what he did so often and from so many angles that it makes no sense anymore.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Ngonyama	But of one thing I was sure: There was a difference in them. They were leagues from home—indeed, without a home— and in [MASK]’s eyes I saw a displacement, an emptiness like maybe all of his brethren as he once knew them were dead.
<name>the captain</name>	the captain	McGaffin	“You were inside? You got past all those locks? All those latches?” “Yessir.” That much at least was true. “So,” said [MASK], “if he broached cargo once, he kin do it again.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Calhoun	He was rubbing his forehead, breathing deep through his nose. One nostril whistled, clogged by something best left unsaid. He took out his handkerchief, pressed a finger to one side of his nose, and blew. “But what about [MASK]?”
<name>Captain</name>	Captain	Meadows	Fingers of sweat dripped from [MASK]’s face, his whipping arm was sore, and he rubbed it, then peered round in my direction. I pressed myself down between the topsail bitt and foremast, the skin on my back crawling.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Flesh	[MASK] could conform to anything. So when they came half-dead from the depths, these eyeless contortionists emerging from a shadowy Platonic cave, they were stiff and sore and stank of their own vomit and feces. Right then I decided our captain was more than just evil.
<name>a privateer</name>	a privateer	Ameri-	We spotted a ship this momin’, boy!” “Whereaway?” “Two miles to leeward in the southeast comer.” “Her flag?” “None. Leastways none I kin see, but I think she’s [MASK] can.
