<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Pop	After the first couple of weeks, [MASK] started drinking openly. She would meet him at the door with a brown-paper package in his hand. He would come downstairs from the bathroom holding himself very straight and cat supper in a genial expansive mood smelling to high heaven of raw whiskey.
<name>Grayson</name>	Grayson	Junto	For [MASK]’s squat-bodied figure was all gray — gray suit, gray hair, gray skin, so that he melted into the room. He could sit forever at that table and nobody would look at him twice. All those people guzzling drinks at the bar never glanced in his direction.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lutie	He hadn’t been able to put her out. Yet as long as she stayed he was certain he could never induce [MASK] to come and live with him. He dwelt on her figure, etching it again and again in the darkness.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jones	Her rich, pleasant voice filled the hallway, and at the sound of it the dog slunk away, his tail between his legs. * You done lived in basements so long you ain’t human no more. You got mould growin’ on you,’ she said to [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bub	‘Your ma need any extra shelves in her closet?’ he asked suddenly. [MASK] stopped talking to look at the Super. What did he keep interrupting him for? He shook his head, ‘Naw,’ he said indifferently.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pullmans	A long jump. A long hard way to get where he was now. Yeah, he thought, [MASK]. The train roaring into the night. Coaches rocking and swaying. A bell that rang and rang and rang, and refused to stop ringing.
<name>She</name>	She	Lutie	The woman was very black, she had a bandanna knotted tightly around her head, and [MASK] saw, with some surprise, that the window was open. She began to wonder how the woman could sit by an open window on a cold, windy night like this one.
<name>What</name>	What	Ma'am	she asked abruptly. ‘ [MASK]?’ ‘ I said what you do for a living?’ ‘ Well, I----* He balanced the hat on one finger. ‘I ain’t exactly working right now at the moment,’ he hedged.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Junto	‘[MASK] sent you this-----’ He pulled a small white box out of his vest pocket and handed it to her. The cover stuck and she pulled it off with a jerk that set the rhinestone earrings inside to glinting as the rainbow-colored lights touched them.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Pop	As she remembered, [MASK] preferred to pay weekly, for on Saturday nights he did a brisk business selling the bootleg liquor that he manufactured, so that on Sunday morning he had the week’s rent money ready to turn over to the agent.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Lutie	In less than half an hour she had the youngsters packed and was putting them into a station wagon. She moved competently with no waste motion. [MASK] watched her from the front porch. Damn white people, she thought. Damn them.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Boots	The women pressed their feet deep into the red carpet, enjoying the feel of it under their shoes, admiring the glimpses they caught of their own reflections in the mirrors on the wall. At the foot of the stairs one of the biggest of the Casino's bouncers laid a hamlike hand on [MASK]’ arm.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Boots	‘Junto’s rich as hell,’ [MASK] said. ‘What you got to be so particular about? There ain’t a dame in town who wouldn’t give everything they got for a chance at him.’ And he thought, Naw, she ain’t acting right.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Junto	We got to stay together after this. Close together. We can go a long way.’ She had thought about her scalp — how scarred and terrible looking it would be. The hair would never grow back. She looked steadily at [MASK], her eyes unwinking.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	JONES	I’ll be seein’ you.’ He walked out of the bar, cat-footed, his face as expressionless as when he came in. I 2. [MASK], THE SUPER, dosed the door of his apartment behind him.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Jim	She got up from the chair, thinking, I can’t stay here in this little place for another minute. I’ll go for a walk. As she changed her clothes, she thought, This is the same thing that happened to [MASK].
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Bub	[MASK] was still sleeping and she tucked the covers tight under his chin, thinking that sometime soon he would wake up in a bedroom of his own. It would have maple furniture and the bedspread and draperies would have ships and boats on them.
<name>Canary</name>	Canary	Cheek	Finally she came to sit in the big chair in the living room, her eyes blinking with pleasure as she looked at the canary and talked to him. She was breathless from her scouring of the kitchen and she talked in gasps and spurts. ‘[MASK]! Check!
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Lutie	He thought of [MASK]’s apartment on the top floor. It was like a magnet whose pull reached down to him and drew him toward it steadily, irresistibly. He dressed quickly in the dark. He had to go up and see if she was home.
<name>John</name>	John	Boots	[MASK] closed the bedroom door, sat down on the edge of the bed, leaning his head against the head-board. ‘If you’ll give me the money now. I’ll be able to get it to the lawyer before he closes his office tonight,’ she said abruptly.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Min	"There’s others interested.’ Yeah. But not as interested as him. He opened the door of his apartment, thinking that he was going to throw [MASK] out so hard she would walk on the other side of the street when she passed this house.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Junto	First step on the way to the army.’ ‘You don’t want to fight?’ ' Why should I?’ ‘I don’t know. I’m asking you.’ He had pulled a chair out and sat down across from [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Jones	He frowned. ‘You mad about somep’n?’ the boy asked. [MASK] shifted uneasily in the chair, made an effort to erase the frown. Now what the hell had the kid been talking about — oh, yes, the movies he had seen.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Bub	He hadn’t known about [MASK]. She had forgotten that she hadn’t told him she had a child. ‘ Can you let me have it? The two hundred dollars?’ she asked. ’Why, sure, baby,’ he said easily.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	He tried to squirm out of her arms and she held him closer and tighter. When she lifted her head, the stretcher was gone. [MASK] stood up and looked around. ‘ What was the matter with her?’ he asked. 'She got hurt.’
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Bub	When the guard finally escorted her to the small room where [MASK] waited, she had begun to believe the silence and the troubled waiting that permeated the room had a smell — a distinct odor that filled her nose until it was difficult for her to breathe.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Supe	It wasn’t really wrong because he was helping the police, but he hadn’t yet been able to get over the feeling that the letters that weren’t the right ones ought to be put back in the boxes. He would talk to [MASK] about it when he went home.
<name>John</name>	John	Lutie	‘If you care to wait, you can sec him for a few minutes this morning.’ [MASK] sat down near the back of the room. It was filled with colored women, sitting in huddlcd-over positions. They sat quietly, not moving.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jones	‘I can fix things so yon won’t be pot out,’ he said finally. ‘I’ll sec what I can do about taking [MASK]’s mind off the young lady, but I won’t promise results on that.’
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Jim	She found the bank book on the kitchen table. Its pages were neatly perforated with the words ’Account Closed.’ The last entry left a nice row of zeros where the balance would normally have been. [MASK] started hunting for a job in dead earnest and couldn’t find one.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Boots	Because you’re still angry, she thought, and you haven’t anyone to vent your anger on and you’re halfway hoping [MASK] will say something or do something that will give you an excuse to blow up in a thousand pieces. ‘Whyn’t you sit down?’
<name>Paula</name>	Paula	Lutie	It smacked against her ears as though it were giving her a final, exasperated blow as proof of its displeasure in not being able to make her move on. [MASK] braced her body against the wind’s attack determined to finish thinking about the apartment before she went in to look at it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Boots	[MASK] ignored them. He patted out the rhythm with his foot and the music started. She walked over to the microphone and stood there waiting for the melody to repeat itself. She touched the mike and then held onto it with both hands, for the silvery metal was cold and her hands were suddenly hot.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Jones	The cop’s face turned redder and redder as he watched the pieces fall into the basket. The lieutenant said, ‘That isn’t enough evidence for a complaint,’ and turned on his heel and walked out. [MASK] and the cop stared at each other.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	[MASK], your kid — flashing smile, strong, straight back, sturdy legs, even white teeth, young, round face, smooth skin — he ends up in reform school because the women work. Go on, she urged. Go all the way.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jim	Her voice was insistent and she threw the words at him bluntly, using no tact. [MASK] got up from the chair where he’d been sitting and stood over her, newspaper in hand. ‘You’re crazy!’ he shouted. Then they were both shouting.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Bub	She looked closer at the cigarette ends. They were moist. Whoever had smoked them had held them, not between their lips, but far inside the mouth so that the paper got wet and the tobacco inside had stained and discolored it. She turned toward [MASK].
<name>Teacake</name>	Teacake	Mary	There ain’t much point in my coming here.’ ‘If you’ll do my shopping for me, you ain't got to worry about no rent.’ So [MASK] came to live with her and she gradually lost her dejected look.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	Was the little bastard going to spoil the whole thing by refusing? 'I don’t know’ — [MASK] wrinkled his forehead. ‘I thought it was something different. This ain’t even exciting.’ ’You can earn a lot of money.’
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Junto	‘And if this is something you planned, you’d better unplan it.’ ‘You heard her, didnya?’ ‘Yes. But you still could have planned it,’ [MASK] said. He walked toward the foyer.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub----	She sat down at the far end of the sofa, trying to think of a way to start. ‘ What’s on your mind, baby?’ he said. ‘ It’s about my son — [MASK]’ ‘ You got a kid?’ he interrupted.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Boots	Perhaps she ought to phone [MASK] and tell him that she wouldn’t come tonight. Perhaps by tomorrow she would be free of this mounting, steadily increasing anger and this hysterical fear that made her see things that didn’t exist, made her feel things that weren’t there.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bub	Why, it’s all crushed, and there’s dirt on it, she thought — great smudges of dirt and tight, small wrinkles as though it had been squeezed together. What on earth had [MASK] been doing with it? She shook him awake.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Junto	And all the time she was thinking, [MASK] has a brick in his hand. Just one brick. The final one needed to complete the wall that had been building up around her for years, and when that one last brick was shoved in place, she would be completely walled in.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bub	In spite of the cost of moving the furniture, if she and [MASK] were very careful they would have more than enough to last until her next pay-day; there might even be a couple of dollars over. If they were very careful.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Min	I didn’t see no point in telling him.’ ‘Well, good-bye, dearie.’ ' See you,’ [MASK] said. And then loudly, clearly, very distinctly she said again, ‘Well, good-bye now.’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	‘Get me a opener,’ he ordered, and reached for the brown-paper bag [MASK] was carrying. He followed the boy into the kitchen and stood in the middle of the room under the glaring, unshaded kitchen light while he lifted the bottle to his mouth.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jones	For in coming here like this, in trying to prevent [MASK] from putting her out, she was actually making an effort to change a situation. No. It was better to think of it as being an effort to keep a situation the way it had been before.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Min	[MASK] walked toward the curtains in the back, and the nearer she got to them, the more she wished that she hadn't come or that while she was sitting waiting outside she had got up and gone home. Her heart started jumping so that she began to breathe heavily.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jones	The men exchanged dubious glances. ‘Might as well hang around. If you sec him go past, call him over to you and put your hand on his shoulder.’ ‘Okay.’ [MASK] waited impatiently as he watched the kids swarming into the street.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bub	‘Hi,’ he said, and grinned. [MASK] looked up, surprised. He turned his head slowly, knowing beforehand what he would find. Yes, there was one on each side of him; two, no, three, in back of him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bub	She woke up at seven o’clock and jumped out of bed, reaching for her dressing-gown and thinking that today they had assembly at school and she had forgotten to iron a white shirt for [MASK] and she would have to hurry so he wouldn’t be late.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Baby	' [MASK], this is just experience,’ he said. ’ Be months before you can earn money at it.’ Afterwards she tried to remember the tone of his voice and couldn’t. She could only remember the thin, ghostly, haunting music.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Lutie	He would fix her so that she’d light out in a hurry and she wouldn’t come back. She and her carpet slippers and her whispering voice. He moved his shoulders distastefully. Why would he have to think about her here in [MASK]’s apartment?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Supe	Hi, [MASK],’ he said and grinned broadly. ‘Thought I’d come up and see if you was all right.’ ‘Come on in.’ He walked into the living room and looked around. It smelt sweet with some faint fragrance that came from the bedroom.
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Boots	Give her presents from time to time.’ He took his wallet out, extracted a handful of bills, gave them to [MASK]. * All women like presents. This will make it easier for you to arrange for me to sec her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	Most of the children had straight bones, strong white teeth. But it couldn’t go on like that. Even the strongest heritage would one day run out. [MASK] was healthy, sturdy, strong, but he couldn’t remain that way living here.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Lutie	He wouldn’t be able to stand the sight of her any more after being close to [MASK] like this. He heard the kid tearing up the stairs and he reached up and jerked out the light. He was standing in the living room when the kid opened the door.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pop	[MASK].’ It was like having the earth suddenly open up so that it turned everything familiar into a crazy upside down position, so that she could no longer find any of the things that had once been hers.
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Junto	That was how it started. As simply and as easily as that. She explained her plan to [MASK], so that he would speak to the people at the precinct and they wouldn't bother her. ‘But this ain’t for white men,’ she warned. '
<name>Al</name>	Al	Bub	' You goin’ to fix the fire?’ [MASK] asked. ‘Yeah,’ he said, and walked quickly toward the cellar door under the stairs. He hooked the door behind him, thinking that he couldn't stand the sight of the kid tonight.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Jim	[MASK] smoked a pipe because cigarettes were a luxury they couldn’t afford. It seemed to her their whole lives revolved around the price of things and as each week crawled by she grew a little more nervous, a little more impatient and irritable.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jones	‘Yeah,’ [MASK] nodded in agreement. ‘The other fellows put ’em back.’ ' Oh, ’ he said, relief in his voice. And then eagerly, ’ Have they caught any of the crooks yet?’ 'No. But they will.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Jones	‘You wait, because I’ll be going along with the things.’ He went out the door and she walked over to [MASK]' desk and laid the doorkey in the middle of it, where he couldn’t possibly miss it when he sat down there.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lutie	She shrugged her shoulders and turned her attention back to the battle going on under her window. As [MASK] climbed the stairs, she deliberately accentuated the clicking of the heels of her shoes on the treads because the sharp sound helped relieve the hard resentment she felt; it gave expression to the anger flooding through her.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jim	She and [MASK] could do the same thing, and she thought she saw what had been wrong with them before — they hadn’t tried hard enough, worked long enough, saved enough. There hadn’t been any one thing they wanted above and beyond everything else.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Lutie	The girl looked to be about nineteen or twenty. She was very thin. Her black hair, thick with grease, gleamed in the dim light. There was an artificial white rose stuck in the center of the pompadour that mounted high above her small, dark face. [MASK] recognized her.
<name>Maranzano</name>	Maranzano	Junto	‘Sure, baby, and I meant it,’ he said easily. ‘It’s true. But I don’t have all the say-so. The guy who owns the Casino — guy named [MASK] — says you ain’t ready yet.’
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bub	She tried to visualize how the room would look and began to wonder why she had already decided to take this room for herself. It might be better to give it to [MASK], let him have a real bedroom to himself for once. No, that wouldn’t do.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	The thought made her move about swiftly, cutting the potatoes into tiny pieces so they would cook quickly, forming the ground meat into small flat cakes, heating the peas, setting the table, pouring a glass of milk for [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jim	She sighed as she watched him cross the street heading toward the bus stop. He might hold himself up straighter and straighter as the years slipped by, but he drank more and more as he grew older. That night after dinner she told [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	And [MASK]’s hair was combed high over her small, pointed face. It was heavy with grease from the hairdresser’s. There was a white rose in the center of her pompadour — the rose seemed to nestle there.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Poppa	The men roared with laughter. ‘Wotsa matter, [MASK]? Won’t she let you buy nothin’ in there?’ Or, ‘ Go on, man, them gals is the sweetest things on the block.’ ‘Hell, she’s got a refined place in there.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bub	What else they going to do but----’ [MASK] walked past them, hands in his pockets; paused for a moment right in front of them to look up and down the street as though deciding in an aimless kind of fashion which way he’d go and how he’d spend the afternoon.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	It could send a kid to camp for a couple of summers. And she had to find a stack of bills like that to keep [MASK] out of reform school. She had never known anyone who had that much money at one time.
<name>Roony</name>	Roony	Naw	‘Packed house. Hanging from the ceiling.’ ‘ No trouble?’ ' [MASK]. There’s never any trouble. Them bruisers see to that.’ ‘Good.’ ‘That girl sings very well,’ he said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jones	[MASK] rolled his empty garbage cans into the area-way and returned to stand in front of the building. In the mornings like this he was usually inside working, shaking the furnace, firing it, taking out ashes. The street had a pleasant, lively look this morning.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Min	I make no guarantee about the young lady. However, I can guarantee that you won’t be put out. Is that all right?’ [MASK] opened her purse, took out two limp five-dollar bills and placed them on the desk.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lutic	and straining to reach up toward the lock that held the chains. He thought she, [MASK], had the key. And he followed her through the street, whining in his throat, nuzzling in back of her with his sharp, pointed dog’s face.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Jones	She looked around the room impatiently, seeking what it was that held her here while the pushcart man waited outside, while the danger of [MASK] coming into the apartment increased with every passing moment. The trouble was she didn’t know why she was going.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Boots	But if she could sing — work hard at it, study, really get somewhere, it would give direction to her life — she would know where she was going. ‘I don’t know your name, baby,’ [MASK] said softly.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	[MASK] would have to cat lunch at home, and that wasn't anything to worry about. It was what happened to him after school that made her frown as she walked along, for he was either in the apartment by himself or playing in the street.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bub	T’vc been worried about us,’ she said. ‘We seem to spend so much money. I’m not able to save very much. And we have to save, [MASK],’ she said earnestly, ‘ so that we won’t always have to live here.’
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Bub	‘You oughtta start work right now,’ he said. ‘Okay, Captain.’ [MASK] lifted his hand in salute. He darted across the street, lingered on the sidewalk for a moment, and then disappeared through the doorway of an apartment house.
<name>Wade</name>	Wade	Bab	There wasn’t any point in answering him. What she should do was to take the checks out of his hand without replying and go on home. Go home to wash oat a pair of stockings for herself, a pair of socks and a shirt for [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Lutie	When [MASK] finally cooled off enough to be able to talk coherently, he only laughed at her. Even when he saw that she was getting into a red rage at the sight of his laughter. ‘ What did you expect?’ he asked.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Supe	She was holding him so tightly that he turned away from his game with the dogs to look up in her face. ’You’re pretty,’ he said, pressing his face close to hers. ’[MASK] says you’re pretty. And he’s right.’
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bub	She was surprised to find that [MASK] was waiting for her at the subway entrance. He didn’t see her, and she paused for a moment, noting the anxious way he watched the people pouring into the street, twisting his neck in his effort to make certain he didn’t miss her.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	She kept remembering how he had pleaded with the cops the night before. Getting a job would make him forget about it. He might not notice the absence of the children. She fed [MASK] and bathed him and put him to bed a little earlier than usual.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Supe	Heavy footsteps came up the stairs and he threw the covers back and sat up listening. Maybe it’s [MASK], he thought. The steps went past the door, on down the hall, and he lay down again disappointed. The stairs outside creaked.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Pop	The people that she knew got money in driblets, driblets that barely covered rent and food and shoes and subway fare, but it never added up to two hundred dollars all at once and piled up in your hand. [MASK] wouldn’t have it.
<name>John</name>	John	Jones	His eye caught the postman’s slow progress up the street. His gray uniform disappeared in and out of the doorways. Each time he appeared, [MASK] noticed how the heavy mail sack slung over his shoulder pulled him over on one side, weighing him down.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lutie	They were sitting in the same shrinking, huddled positions. Perhaps, she thought, we’re all here because we're all poor. Maybe it doesn’t have anything to do with color. [MASK] folded her hands in her lap. Fifteen minutes went by.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jones	‘ You gotta get people to complain about her. And then take ’em down to the station with you,’ the man explained. [MASK] tried out the people in the house. He talked to some of the women first, keeping his voice casual.
<name>betrayed</name>	betrayed	Lutic	Watching him he had thought, When he grows up he’s going to be strong and big like his father. The thought made him draw away from the nearness of the boy who was so like the father — that man who had [MASK] when she was a virgin.
<name>He</name>	He	Lutie	Because, too, of a shrinking withdrawal in her way of sitting as though she were trying to take up the least possible amount of space. So that after bowing to her [MASK] completely forgot the woman was in the room, while she went on studying its furnishings.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Lutie	The lawyer was reading an evening paper when [MASK] entered his office. He stared at her, trying to estimate the fee he could charge, trying to guess her reason for coming. A divorce, he decided. All good-looking women invariably wanted divorces.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bub	The sun glinted on the bits of metal on his harness, enriched the chestnut brown of his hide. [MASK] stared at the approaching pair completely entranced, for the street stretched away and away in back of them and the horse and the man glowed in the sunlight.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lutic	There was a swish-swish noise when she moved from the stove to the sink as she was doing now. Whenever he heard the sound, he thought of [MASK]’s high-heeled shoes and the clicking noise her heels made when she walked.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Boots	She pressed the bell harder than she'd intended and drew her hand away quickly, expecting to hear the loud shrilling of a bell. Instead there was the soft sound of chimes and [MASK] opened the door. His shirt was open at the throat, the sleeves rolled up.
