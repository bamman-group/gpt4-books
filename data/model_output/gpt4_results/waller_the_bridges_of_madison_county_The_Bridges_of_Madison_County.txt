<name>Duke</name>	Duke	John	He was workin' on somethin' where he was tryin' to convert music into visual images. He said to me, "[MASK], you know that riff you almost always play in the fourth measure of 'Sophisticated Lady'? Well, I think I got that on film the other morning.
<name>She</name>	She	Francesca	Will you have one with me?" Stalling, looking for his center, losing it moment by moment. She would. He opened two and set one on her side of the table. [MASK] was pleased with how she looked and how she felt. Feminine.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Francesca	It ■ was 1987, her sixty-seventh birthday ■ [MASK] had been lying on her bed ■ for two hours. She could see and touch ■ and smell and hear all of it from ■I twenty-two years ago. A. m She had remembered, then remembered again.
<name>David</name>	David	Francesca	So [MASK] became a photographer's assistant. He had been wrong. There was much to see. There was a performance of sorts, though he was not aware of it. It was what she had noticed yesterday and part of what drew her toward him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	She would have done anything for him except destroy her family and maybe him as well. She went down the stairs and sat at the old kitchen table with the yellow Formica top. [MASK] had bought a new one,- he'd insisted on it.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Francesca	He shot, loaded film, changed lenses, changed cameras, shot some more, and talked quietly to her as he worked, always telling her how good she looked to him and how much he loved her. "[MASK], you're incredibly beautiful.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Robert	I know children have a tendency to think of their parents as rather asexual, so I hope what I'm going to say won't shock you, and I certainly hope it won't destroy your memory of me. In our old kitchen, [MASK] and I spent hours together.
<name>Nikon</name>	Nikon	Nikon	She opened the knapsack, feeling a little overcautious about the expensive equipment he handled so casually, and took out the camera. It said "[MASK]" on the chrome plating of the viewfinder, with an "F" to the upper left of the name.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Robert	"[MASK], I'm not quite finished. If you took me in your arms and carried me to your truck and forced me to go with you, I wouldn't murmur a complaint. You could do the same thing just by talking to me.
<name>Susans</name>	Susans	Susans	"Yes, it is. We take these old bridges for granted around here and don't think much about them." He walked to her and held out a small bouquet of wildflowers, black-eyed [MASK]. "Thanks for the guided tour."
<name>Moonlight</name>	Moonlight	Tangerine	So she walked to the sink and turned on the radio. More country music. She adjusted the dial until the sound of a big band came on and left it there. " '[MASK],' " he said. "What?" 'The song.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Richard	About standing along the sea wall as a teenager and watching ships from all over the world. About the American soldiers that came later. About meeting [MASK] in a cafe where she and some girlfriends were drinking coffee. The war had disrupted lives, and they wondered if they would ever get married.
<name>She</name>	She	Francesca	Add water, a pint of it. Add remaining vegetables and seasonings. Cook slowly, about forty minutes. With the cooking under way, [MASK] sat across from him once again. Modest intimacy descended upon the kitchen. It came, somehow, from the cooking.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Kincaid	Anything else he could buy on the road if he had forgotten it. [MASK] wore faded Levi's, well-used Red Wing field boots, a khaki shirt, and orange suspenders. On his wide leather belt was fastened a Swiss Army knife in its own case.
<name>She</name>	She	Francesca	She could see the sun flashing off his silver bracelet. The top two buttons of his shirt were open. He moved into the lane and down it. [MASK] kept wiping her eyes, trying to see, the sunlight making strange prisms from her tears.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Francesca	He's starin' at his bottle of beer, but when I said "[MASK]," he slowly looked up at me, brushed back his long gray hair with both hands, lit a Camel, and those blue eyes came right at me.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Robert	You said you never remembered me wearing it, so why couldn't it be made over to ft you. That was the dress I wore the first night [MASK] and I made love. I've never looked as good in my entire life as I did that night.
<name>Thales</name>	Thales	Euclid	Past the ice, still further back along the measure of things, deep salt water in which I swim, gilled and scaled. I cannot see more than that, except beyond plankton is the digit zero. [MASK] was not always right. He assumed par-
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Richard	That was not fair, and I knew it. I prefer, at least I think I do, because of [MASK]'s memory and the way people talk, that all of this be kept within the Johnson family, somehow. I'll leave it to your judgment, though.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	[MASK] was interested in sex only occasionally, every couple of months, but it was over fast, rudimentary and unmoving, and he didn't seem to care much about perfume or shaving or any of that. It was easy to get a little sloppy.
<name>Antoine</name>	Antoine	Robert	[MASK] had asked her to arch her back ever so slightly, and he had whispered then, "Yes, yes, that's it, stay there." That was when he had taken the photograph at which she now stared.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Francesca	Take your pick." She set three different bottles on the counter, each partly used. "Thanks." He tossed his fresh clothes on the bed, and [MASK] noted the khakis, white shirt, and sandals. None of the local men wore sandals.
<name>she</name>	she	Francesca	A long time ago." The green truck again. Along the gravel roads with the sun lowering itself. Twice they met cars, but it was nobody [MASK] knew. In the four minutes it took to reach the farm, she drifted, feeling unraveled and strange.
<name>Albert</name>	Albert	Richard	"Something I've never been able to adapt to, to understand, is how they can lavish such love and care on the animals and then see them sold for slaughter. I don't dare say anything about it, though. [MASK] and his friends would be down on me in a flash.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Richard	It had been a long time since she had taken a walk like this. After supper, which was always at five, there was the television news, then the evening programs, watched by [MASK] and sometimes by the children when they had finished their homework.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Francesca	He left the magazine in 1975. The address and phone number I have are . . ." He read off the same information [MASK] already had. She stopped trying after that, mostly because she was afraid of what she might discover.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Francesca	"My God," she breathed. The medallion said "[MASK]" on it. That was his one small indiscretion, and she forgave him for it, smiling. In all of the photos after that, the medallion was always there on the silver chain.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Francesca	He seemed pretty quiet, nice enough, even a little bashful. As they talked on, the evening turned blue, light fog brushing the meadow grass. He opened two more beers for them while [MASK]'s stew cooked, quietly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richard	Men such as [MASK]— most men, she guessed—were threatened by these expectations. In a way, women were asking for men to be poets and driving, passionate lovers at the same time. Women saw no contradiction in that. Men did.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Francesca	Up close, 1 could see the name [MASK] on it. So I asked him, "Anything special about that?" He didn't say anything for a while, just stared out at the water. Then he said, "How much time do you have?"
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Harry	[MASK] was reluctant to start, as usual, but she could hear his boot hitting the accelerator, and the old truck eventually relented. He shifted into reverse and sat there with the clutch in. First serious, then with a little grin, pointing toward the lane.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Francesca	Just before be died, I was sitting by him in a Des Moines hospital, and he said this to me: "[MASK], I know you had your own dreams, too. I'm sorry I couldn't
<name>Roscoe</name>	Roscoe	Jack	It must have been him, for she heard his truck coming up the lane just after she arrived. [MASK] barked at first but settled down right away, muttering to himself, "Same guy as last night,- okay, I guess."
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Kincaid	She lay there in bed, having slept naked for the first time as far back as she could remember. She could imagine [MASK], hair blowing in the wind curling through the truck window, one hand on the wheel, the other holding a Camel.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richard	You seem a little tired or dreamy or somethin'." "Yes, I'm just fine, [MASK]. It's good to have you back safe and sound." "Well, I'm turnin' in,- it's been a long week at the fair, and I'm bushed.
<name>Simlicity</name>	Simlicity	Simplicity	Complex things are easy to do. [MASK]'s the real challenge. 1 worked on it every day until I began to get it right. Then I worked on it some more and wrote out some lead sheets for the piano and bass. Finally, one night I played it.
<name>Houdini</name>	Houdini	Robert	Had I truly understood that, when he was face to face with me and asking me to go, I probably would have left with him. [MASK] believed the world had become too rational, had stopped trusting in magic as much as it should.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Richard	[MASK] and his friends would say you're trying to destroy their livelihood. I don't eat much meat myself,- I'm not sure why, I just don't care for it. But every time I try a meatless supper on the family, there are howls of rebellion.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frannie	Some other things we want to see next day. Be home Friday, late." "All right, have a good time and drive carefully.” "[MASK], you sure you're okay? Sound a little strange." "No, I'm fine.
<name>he</name>	he	Richard	"Not for a little bit. It's kind of nice out here, so I think I'll just sit awhile." She was tired, but she was also afraid [MASK] might have sex in mind. She just couldn't handle that tonight.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Francesca	[MASK] peeled potatoes into the sink, aware of being so close to a strange man. She had never thought of peeling potatoes as having little slanting feelings connected with it. "You play the guitar? I saw the case in your truck." "A little bit.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	When she rented out the land, after [MASK] died, she stipulated the pasture must be kept intact, left untouched, even though it was empty now and had turned to meadow grass. The first serious lines were just beginning to show on her face in the photograph.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richard	[MASK] said it'd be late Friday before they're home. Something they want to see on Thursday. It's a long drive, particularly in the stock truck. . . . No, football practice doesn't start for another week. Uh-huh, a week.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Francesca	And through all of those years, 1 have been falling toward you." When they came downstairs, the radio was still on. Dawn had come up, but the sun lay behind a thin cloud cover. "[MASK], I have a favor to ask."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marge	"[MASK], I was just getting ready to step into my bath when you called, so I'd better run before the water gets cold. . . . Okay, I'll call soon. 'Bye."
<name>She</name>	She	Francesca	And I'll be around here for a few more days. Think about what I've said. I can be here, settle the matter in short order, and we could drive northwest together." [MASK] said nothing. She knew he could, indeed, settle the matter in short order.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Richard	Something as simple as a cold glass of beer at bath time felt so elegant. Why didn't she and [MASK] live this way? Part of it, she knew, was the inertia of protracted custom. All marriages, all relationships, are susceptible to that.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Francesca	"It's all right," [MASK] said, wiping her eyes on the towel hanging from the cupboard door. "I'll make some excuse for getting mail from a hippie photographer, as long as it's not too much."
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Francesca	"It's real nice, real pretty here," he said, his voice reverberating inside the covered bridge. [MASK] nodded. "Yes, it is. We take these old bridges for granted around here and don't think much about them."
<name>Deborah</name>	Deborah	Richard	It lacks romance, eroticism, dancing in the kitchen to candlelight, and the wonderful feel of a man who knows how to love a woman. Most of all, it lacks you. But there's this damn sense of responsibility I have. To [MASK], to the children.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Francesca	In the way he was turned, she could see the top of his chest through the open buttons of his shirt and small beads of moisture lying there upon his skin. [MASK] was feeling good feelings, old feelings, poetry and music feelings.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Francesca	In both of them. Sitting by the window on her sixty-seventh birthday, [MASK] watched the rain and remembered. She carried her brandy into the kitchen and stopped for a moment, staring at the exact spot where the two of them had stood.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Marge	Her hand lay quietly upon him. She could feel the muscle running from his neck along his shoulder, just back of his collarbone. She was looking down on the thick gray hair, neatly parted. Saw how it drifted over his collar. [MASK] babbled on.
<name>Mrs.</name>	Mrs.	Mrs.	"Yes. A little place with cabins. Something-or-other Motor Court. I just checked in this morning. Haven't even unloaded my gear yet." "That's the only place to stay, except for [MASK] Carlson's,- she takes in roomers.
<name>She</name>	She	Francesca	I'm not sure what that means, but I'll use it somewhere. So I think I kind of know how you feel." [MASK] smiled at him then. For the first time, she smiled warm and deep. And the gambler's instincts took over. "
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	She had smoked years ago but gave it up under the steady thump of criticism from [MASK]. He shook out another one, put it between his lips, and flicked a gold Zippo lighter into flame, holding it toward her while he kept his eyes on the road.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	F4e	Why, she didn't know. [MASK] had a right to be married, but somehow it didn't fit him. She didn't want him to be married. "She couldn't stand the long shoots when I'd be gone for months.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carolyn	They divided the materials from the box and began looking through them. The manila envelope was in [MASK]'s stack, about a third of the way down. She was puzzled when she opened it and removed the contents.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Kincaid	I felt good about that. Anyway, that's about it. Not long after I found out what happened to [MASK], my left arm started going numb when I play for more than twenty minutes. Something to do with a vertebra problem So I don't work anymore.
<name>He</name>	He	Robert	I am asking you to make him part of ours, however difficult that may seem to you at first. At least I had a family, a life with others. [MASK] was alone. That was not fair, and I knew it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Francesca	[MASK] said nothing, wondering about a man to whom the difference between a pasture and a meadow seemed important, who got excited about sky color, who wrote a little poetry but not much fiction. Who played the guitar, who earned his living by images and carried his tools in knapsacks.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Robert	Other than that, [MASK] had no family, as far as I know. I am asking you to make him part of ours, however difficult that may seem to you at first. At least I had a family, a life with others.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	tom	The chain and medallion got [MASK] off in the fall. Fortunately they landed close by. I found them again, and a jeweler mended the chain. I live with dust on my heart. That's about as well as I can put it.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Kincaid	"We always said [MASK] was a little strange, none of us knew him well outside of the work he did for us. But he was a pro. We could send him anywhere, and he'd deliver, even though he disagreed with our editorial decisions most of the time.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jack	Sound a little strange." "No, I'm fine. Just hot. I'll be better after my bath." "Okay. Say hello to [MASK] for me." "Yes, I'll do that.”
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Francesca	He had seen the mailbox. "Yes," said [MASK], slightly short of breath. Once her words started, they kept on coming. "It's pretty hot. Would you like an ice tea?" He looked over at her.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Richard	"Shower?" "That'd be great. Show me the way." She took him upstairs to the bathroom she had insisted [MASK] put in when the children were growing up. That was one of the few demands on which she had stood firm.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richard	On New Year's Eve, at the Legion Hall, she and [MASK] would have some drinks. Other than that, not much, and there seldom was liquor in the house, except for a bottle of brandy she had bought once in some vague spasm of hope for romance in their country lives.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Carolyn	As for [MASK], I'm afraid the bad news is that there was only one of him, and no more. If not for your father and the two of you, I would have gone anywhere with him, instantly. He asked me to go, begged me to go.
<name>Keep</name>	Keep	Tripod	Just as he fired the shutter, something caught his eye. He looked through the viewfinder again. "What the hell is hanging by the entrance to the bridge?" he muttered. "A piece of paper. Wasn't there yesterday." [MASK] steady.
<name>Dylan</name>	Dylan	Dylan	The only song of [MASK]'s he had ever really cared for was "Girl from the North Country." He could play and sing that one, and he hummed the words to himself as he left behind the place with giant red holes in the earth.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Editors	Bucolic, conservative stuff, but nice and solid. The one with the farmer and horses might even be a cover shot,- that's why he had left the space at the top of the frame, room for type, for a logo. [MASK] liked that kind of thoughtful craftsmanship.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	She had decided to keep it in her safe deposit box at the bank after [MASK] died but brought it home for a few days each year at this time. The lid on the walnut chest was shut on the cameras, and the chest was placed on the closet shelf in her bedroom.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kincaid	[MASK] was leaning against the refrigerator, arms folded across his chest, Budweiser in his right hand. She was pleased that he noticed her legs, and he did. He noticed all of her. He could have walked out on this earlier, could still walk.
<name>Hippie</name>	Hippie	Hippies	"Sure does have long hair. Looks like one of them Beatle fellows, or what is it they been callin' some of them other people? [MASK], ain't that it?" That brought laughter in the back booth and to the table next to it.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Richard	The truck radio, indistinguishable almost in the roar of road and wind, carried a steel guitar song, followed by the five o'clock news. He turned the truck up the lane. "[MASK] is your husband?" He had seen the mailbox.
<name>Kodak</name>	Kodak	Gitzo	Stuffed behind the packs was a tan vest with many pockets. Out of one pocket dangled a thin cord with a plunger on the end. Behind her feet were two tripods. They were badly scratched, but she could read part of the worn label on one: "[MASK]."
<name>Alabaster</name>	Alabaster	Francesca	He's sittin' there, quietly, listenin' hard like he always did, and I say over the microphone, "I'm gonna play a tune I wrote for a friend of mine. It's called '[MASK].'"
<name>She</name>	She	Francesca	A local carpenter had made the box to her design, out of walnut, with dust seals and padded interior sections. "Pretty fancy box," he had said. [MASK] had only smiled. The last part of the ritual was the manuscript.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Francesca	Her long black hair was fastened up by a tortoiseshell comb her father had given her when she left the old country. The truck rolled up the lane and stopped near the gate to the wire fence surrounding the house. [MASK] stepped off the porch and walked unhurriedly through the grass toward the gate.
<name>He</name>	He	Kincaid	" When she said yes, he reached into a knapsack and pulled out a camera, draping the strap over his shoulder. [MASK] pushed open the hack porch door and held it for her, followed her out, then shut it gently. They went down the cracked
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Carolyn	and I had over the pink dress. It went on for days. I whined and asked why. Then I refused to speak to her. All she ever said was, 'No, [MASK], not that one.'"
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Francesca	Music ow what? thought [MASK]. Supper over, sitting there. He took care of it. “How about a walk out in the meadow? It's cooling down a little." When she said yes, he reached into a knapsack and pulled out a camera, draping the strap over his shoulder.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frannie	Knew [MASK] was home so I did'n bother to check on it." Up broken cement steps to the back porch door. He held the door for her, carrying his camera knapsacks. "Awful hot to leave the equipment in the truck," he had said when he pulled them out.
<name>James</name>	James	Robert	The dress was my small and foolish memory of that time. That's why I never wore it again and why I refused to let you wear it. After [MASK] left here in 1965, I realized I knew very little about him, in terms of his family
<name>Shep</name>	Shep	Jack	A pheasant called from the fields. [MASK], the collie, barked twice out in the yard. Mosquitoes tested the window screen near the table, and a single moth, circuitous of thought yet sure of instinct, was goaded by the sink light's possibilities.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Francesca	Watched her body, thought of the intelligence he knew she possessed, wondered about the other things he sensed in her. He was drawn to her, fighting it back. The garden was in shade now. [MASK] moved through it with a dishpan done in cracked white enamel.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Kincaid	One of the last of the old-style boys, [MASK] thought, grinning. He knew when the good ones came by and could already see what the final print would look like as he worked. On the vertical shots he left some light sky where a title could go.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Marian	He could play and sing that one, and he hummed the words to himself as he left behind the place with giant red holes in the earth. [MASK] had shown him some chords and how to handle basic arpeggios to accompany himself. "
<name>Moths</name>	Moths	Moths	In a slow, unremitting way, she was turning for home, toward a place she'd never been. It was hot. The humidity was up, and thunder rolled far in the southwest. [MASK] plastered themselves on the screens, looking in at the candles, chasing the fire.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Fie	Who seemed like the wind. And moved like it. Came from it, perhaps. [MASK] looked upward, hands in his Levi's pockets, camera hanging against his left hip. "The silver apples of the moon/The gclden apples of the sun.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Robert	He has no way of dealing with it." "Are we going to let all of this go, then?" He was serious, not smiling. "I don't know that, either. [MASK], in a curious way, you own me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Robert	[MASK]. . . no." She said it softly and bowed her head. An hour later she was able to continue reading. The straightforward language of the law, the precision of the words, angered her. "V^e represent ..."
<name>Al</name>	Al	Carolyn	"Everything okay?" "Yes." "[MASK]'s steer'll be judged on Wednesday. Some other things we want to see next day. Be home Friday, late." "All right, have a good time and drive carefully.”
<name>I</name>	I	Francesca	Divorced me a year later. We never had children, so it wasn't complicated. Took one guitar, left the el cheapo with me." "You hear from her?" "No, never.” That was all he said. [MASK] didn't push it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Francesca	I have this image of a fat little man in baggy Bermuda shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a straw hat with beer-can openers dangling from it, clutching fistfuls of dollars." [MASK] laughed quietly, thinking about safety and comfort.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Michael	"[MASK], what are we going to do? Think about it for a moment,- I'll be right back." She ran up the stairs and returned in a few minutes carrying the pink dress folded carefully in plastic.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Michael	Something they want to see on Thursday. It's a long drive, particularly in the stock truck. . . . No, football practice doesn't start for another week. Uh-huh, a week. At least that's what [MASK] said.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Francesca	Don't you see, I love you so much that I cannot think of restraining you for a moment. To do that would be to kill the wild, magnificent animal that is you, and the power would die with it." He started to speak, but [MASK] stopped him.
<name>Art</name>	Art	Francesca	His hand moved toward her, and she took it. "Thanks for the evening, the supper, the walk. They were all nice. You're a good person, [MASK]. Keep the brandy toward the front of the cupboard,- maybe it'll work out after a while."
