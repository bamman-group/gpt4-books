<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Isaiah	I want you to do something for me. Something big. I don’t want you to go to the church meeting.” Then, as the black boy’s expressive face, all smiles the instant before, became suddenly doleful: “[MASK], listen hard.
<name>Cochise</name>	Cochise	Sabra	[MASK] had shuddered with disgust. This Sunday morning they flocked in by the dozens, with their sorry nags and their scabrous dogs. The men were decked in all their beads and chains with metal plaques. They camped outside the town, at the end of the street.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Voices	The walls of the room were wafer thin; mere pine slats with cracks between. From the street below came women’s shrill laughter, the sound of a piano hammered horribly. Horses clattered by. [MASK] came up in jocose greeting; there were conversations and arguments excruciatingly prolonged beneath her window.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sabra	Up he galloped; stared, wheeled, flung himself off his horse, ran toward her in his high-heeled cowboy boots (strangely enough all that [MASK] could recall about him afterward were those boots as he came toward her.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sabra	It really looked as though she might make after them. But she thought better of it and sailed down the steps in triumph to behold a crushed, a despairing Yancey. “Oh, my God, [MASK]! What have you done to me!”
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ruby	“Four o’clock big dinner, big dance. Your son want um come tell you. Want um know he marry [MASK] this morning.” She was silent again, smiling her foolish fixed smile. Big Elk’s fan went back and forth, back and forth.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Yancey	What else?” “Oh, a low voice, and kind of sweet, as though he sang tenor. And his teeth------” [MASK] interrupted. “Long, weren’t they? The two at the side, I mean. Like a wolf’s?”
<name>Lauren</name>	Lauren	Sabra	The wind and the flies seemed to torture [MASK]. It was so unusual a luxury that frequently strangers came to the door by mistake, thinking that here was the butcher shop, which boasted the only other screen door in the town.
<name>Amy Lawrence</name>	Amy Lawrence	Grandma	That’s the new psychology, you know. You used to tell me about [MASK] trailing around in her white ruffled dimity wrappers and her high heels, never lifting a lily hand.” “At least your grandmother didn’t consider it a career.”
<name>Mrs. Tate</name>	Mrs. Tate	Sabra	“What was that?” “That was an Indian.” “How could you tell?” “He dismounted on the opposite side from a white man.” That night it was [MASK] who did not sleep. She held the boy tight in her arms.
<name>Fenimore Cooper</name>	Fenimore Cooper	Yancey	If she could have known that his later life was to be shaped by [MASK]’s tales and this incident, certainly her protests would have been even more forceful than they were. “Why can’t you talk to him about something besides those dirty thieving Indians?
<name>Rufus</name>	Rufus	Isaiah	Then, too, there had been an early pest of moths and June flies this spring. High above the table, and directly over it, on a narrow board suspended by rods from the lofty ceiling sat perched [MASK], the little black boy.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Yancey	Then, in a voice rising to a scream, “No! No! No! What? Is he dead?” The Irishman came over to her then, as she crouched at the window. “Oh, no, ma’am. [MASK]’s all right.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Sabra	Synchronous with the permanent wave and the reducing diet the oil-rich Osage matrons of [MASK]’s age cast sentiment aside for fashion, quietly placed the clumsy gold band in a bureau drawer and appeared with a slim platinum circlet bearing, perhaps, the engraved anachronism, “M. G.-K. L. 1884.”
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Sabra	For a dreadful moment she thought that he was drunk or mad. He flung his soiled white sombrero to the desk top, he swept her into his arms, he set her down. “[MASK]! Here’s news for you.
<name>Mae</name>	Mae	Sabra	Her school days finished, and she a finished product of those days, she now looked about her coolly, calculatingly. Her mother she regarded with a kind of affectionate amusement. “What a rotten deal you’ve had, [MASK] dear,” she would drawl.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	Cim	“How could you give a gun to a child like that! You’ll be giving one to [MASK], here, next. Alone in the house, with a gun.” “It isn’t loaded. Come on, honey. We’re late.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Osage	These were different. The leader, a handsome black-haired woman of not more than twenty-two or -three, had taken for herself and her companions such rooms as they could get in the town. [MASK] gazed on the parasols, bedazzled.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Hefner	Isaiah she could not hold. His lean black body could be seen squirming in and out of the crowds; his ebony face, its eyes popping, was always in the front row of the throng gloating before [MASK]’s window.
<name>Tonto</name>	Tonto	Yancey	They built it there when he was Chief, and they still use it regularly for the ceremony. [MASK] showed it to me once, when he drove me out here.” She stopped and cleared her throat, for her voice was suddenly husky.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yancey	“Well, now, say, that’s plumb terr’ble, that is. Might be I can help you out—you and your good lady here. But say, [MASK], just let me step out, will you, to the corner, and mail this here letter.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cim	“I should think a man of almost eighteen could find something better to do than sit in a kitchen in the middle of the day talking to an Indian hired girl. Where’s your pride!” [MASK]’s eyes were still cast down.
<name>Magawisca</name>	Magawisca	Sabra	He saw the Indian woman in her white doeskin dress. His eyes shone enormous. He lifted his head as though to breathe deeply. At that look in his face [MASK] ran across the yard. One hand was at her breast, as though an Indian arrow had pierced her.
<name>John</name>	John	Cim	She knew she must not lose her dignity before this Indian woman— before her son. Yet this thing was, to her way of thinking, monstrous. [MASK] gathered up the reins, his eyes on the restive ponies. “I may stay to see some of the dancing and the Mescal Ceremony.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Pegler	What’s that got to do with [MASK]?” She hated the name. She hated the dead man who was stalking their new life and threatening to destroy it. “I saw that one copy of his paper. He called it the New Day— poor devil.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Walt	It is: ‘I say the real and permanent grandeur of these states must be their religion.’ That’s what "[MASK] says. And that’s the text I intended to use for the subject of my sermon, though I know that the Bible should furnish it.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Sabra	He refused stubbornly to lie on the mattress inside the larger wagon; denied that he was sleepy. [MASK] coaxed him to curl up on the wagon seat, his head in her lap. She held the reins in one hand; one arm was about the child.
<name>Rockefeller</name>	Rockefeller	Yancey	There was, certainly, no building large enough to hold the thousands who, surprisingly enough, made up this settlement spawned overnight on the prairie. [MASK], bom entrepreneur, took hold with the enthusiasm that he always displayed in the first spurt of a new enterprise.
<name>Mrs. Haines</name>	Mrs. Haines	Sabra	But then, [MASK] never had pretended to understand these Indians. “I will be back to-morrow morning.” She walked slowly out of the house by way of the kitchen door, across the yard with her slow insolent dragging step.
<name>he</name>	he	Yancey	She looked at him, her face white, shocked. She looked up, in embarrassment, at the glaring steel sky; she looked down at the blinding red dust, she looked helplessly in the direction that [MASK] had so blithely taken.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Sabra	“It’s your own fault, [MASK]. You’re bound that the boy shall live the life you’ve planned for him instead of the one he wants. So he’s trying to escape into a dream life.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Yancey	They’ll kill you, too—they’ll shoot you down—and then what shall I do?— Cim—Cim—and I here, alone—[MASK], darling—I love you so—if anything should happen to you------” She waxed incoherent.
<name>Uncas</name>	Uncas	Cim	My husband went off on the track of a deer . . . hours ago ... he hasn’t come back . . . then when [MASK] ... I came out and he was gone. . . . I was so—so terribly . ..”
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Sabra	Here they came out of butcher’s shop or grocery store with the day’s provisions in their arms; a packet of meat, tins of tomatoes or peaches, unwrapped. After sharp furtive glances at [MASK], they vanished into this little pine shack or that.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Sabra	He bent far over in his saddle, picked her up in one great arm, held her close while he kissed her long and hard. “[MASK], come with me. Let’s get clear away from this.” “You’ve gone crazy!
<name>James</name>	James	Yancey	Perhaps, after all, this new community was about to make a proper beginning. [MASK], she thought, looked terribly handsome, towering there on the roulette table, his eyes alight, his slim foot, in its shining boot, keeping time to the music.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Sabra	One of [MASK]’s gingham kitchen aprons, checked blue and white, was always hitched up under his arms, and beneath this utilitarian yet coquettish garment his great bare feet slapped in and out as he did the work of the household. He was utterly fascinated by the new baby.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Yancey	It was at that moment, so curiously does the human mind work, that [MASK] caught that elusive resemblance. Now he picked the man up and flung him over his great shoulder as he would a sack of meal. “Yah!”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Yancey	[MASK] had gone out to see to the horses, to get what information he could about renting a house, and a shack for the newspaper. A score of plans were teeming in his mind. “You’ll be all right,” he had said.
<name>Indians</name>	Indians	Bucks	[MASK], braves, chiefs, squaws, papooses; tepees, poles, pots, dogs, ponies, the cavalcade swept through the quiet sunny streets of the mid-westem town, a vivid frieze of color against the drab monotony of the prairies.
<name>Faulkner</name>	Faulkner	Yancey	[MASK]’s contributions were brilliant but spasmodic. The necessary departmental items—real estate transfers, routine court news, out-of-town district and county gleanings—bored him, though he knew well that they were necessary to the success of the paper.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Yancey	All her neat conventional life she had slept in a four-poster bed with a dotted Swiss canopy and net curtains and linen sheets that smelled sweetly of the sun and the air. [MASK] began to make camp. Already the duties of this new manner of living had become familiar.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cim	She did not realize (it being long before the day of psychology as applied so glibly to the training of children) that she was, so far as [MASK] was concerned, years too late. At eight his character was formed.
<name>Grey Beaver</name>	Grey Beaver	Cim	He placed the child in her upraised arms, wheeled, and was gone before she could open her lips to frame a word of thanks. The piece of deer meat, neatly wrapped, lay on the ground at her feet. She stood staring after the galloping figure, dumbly. She took [MASK]’s hand.
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Osage	One day the eyes of [MASK]’s male population were dazzled (and its female population’s eyes affronted) by a burst of rosy splendor shading from pale pink to scarlet. The next day they would shade from palest lavender to deepest purple.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Sabra	A linotype machine, that talented iron monster, now chattered and chittered and clanked in the composing room of the Wigwam. It was the first of its kind in the Oklahoma country. Very costly and uncannily human, [MASK] never quite got over her fear of it.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Sol	“Let me drive, will you, [MASK]?” Without a word he entrusted the reins to her strong, accustomed hands; the hands of one who had come of generations of horse lovers. The animals sensed the change. They leaped ahead in the darkness.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Sabra	[MASK] was a trifle startled, but she said thank you, primly. “You are a Congress member, you are editor of a great newspaper, you are well known through the country. You American women, you are really amazing.”
<name>Miss Lonelyhearts</name>	Miss Lonelyhearts	Sabra	When [MASK] was in town she made a practice of driving down to the office at eleven every night, remaining there for an hour looking over the layout, reading the wet galley proof of the night’s news lead, scanning the A. P. wires.
<name>He</name>	He	Cim	Then came screams of women, the sound of horses galloping. She lay there, cowering. [MASK] stirred in his bed, sighed deeply, slept again. She was too terrified to go to the window. Her shivering seemed to shake the bed.
<name>Melville</name>	Melville	Sabra	A plump round mahogany foot rest it was, covered with a gay tapestry that had been stitched by [MASK]’s grandmother on the distaff side. Its pattern of faded scarlet and yellow and blue represented what seemed to be a pair of cockatoos sparring in a rose bush.
<name>The Kid</name>	The Kid	Yancey	‘Send me the paper for ten years,’ he says. ‘Where to?’ [MASK] asks him. Well, say, the Kid laughs that wolf laugh of his again and he says, ‘I never thought of that.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Donna	You let that slut—that hussy—take it away from you—or you gave it to her. Go and take her with you. You’ll never make me go. I’ll stay here with my children and run the paper. Mother! Cim! [MASK]!”
<name>Mr. Wilson</name>	Mr. Wilson	Cravat	And that about her hair and boots and hands?” [MASK], standing behind his wife’s chair, looked down at her; at the fine white line that marked the parting of her thick black hair. With one forefinger he touched her cheek, gently.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Thus	They can’t say so. You shot him very nicely in the ear, darling.” [MASK] had a scant eighteen hours in the Oklahoma country twisted her normal viewpoint so askew that she did not even notice the grotesquerie of what she had just said.
<name>Spindletop</name>	Spindletop	Yancey	There never was such a joke! It’s cosmic—it’s terrible. How the gods must be roaring. ‘Laughter unquenchable among the blessed gods!’” “[MASK] dear, we’re used to oil out here. It’s an old story.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Sabra	She did not limp—or, rather, hid the tendency to limp by the irritating sliding sound. Her walk was straight, leisurely, measured. [MASK] was terribly embarrassed; apologized to the Indian girl. The girl only looked at her and said nothing.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sabra	[MASK] sprang to her feet, one hand at her breast, one hand on the desk, to steady herself. He strode into the office. For five years she had pictured him returning to her in dramatic fashion; in his white sombrero, his Prince Albert, his high-heeled boots.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Sabra	He went to work quietly, efficiently, aided by [MASK], making the best of such crude and hasty necessities as came to hand. The girl made no outcry. Her eyes were a dull, dead black; her face was rigid.
<name>Winfield</name>	Winfield	Yancey	Seated at his desk in the Wig' warn office [MASK] heard hoots, howls, catcalls, and then the crack and rat-a-tat-tat of a fusillade. The porch of the Sunny Southwest Saloon was filled with grinning faces beneath sombreros.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Yancey	“Yessir, [MASK], that was one of the quickest draws I ever see... . And you was on to him all the time, huh? Sa-a-ay, you’re a slick one, all right. They don’t come no slicker.. . .
<name>Zelda</name>	Zelda	Pegler	Editorials to write, news to get, lot of real estate transfers—and I’m going to find out who killed [MASK] and print it in the first issue if it takes the last drop of blood in me.” “Oh, please don’t.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sabra	As he helped [MASK] down her knees suddenly bent, and he caught her as she sank. “Oh! It’s all right. Stiff, I guess—from the ride.” She leaned against him a moment, then straightened determinedly. He took her arm firmly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Isaiah	The hide shrank and shrank and shrank in the burning sun, closer and closer, day by day, until soon there was no movement within it. [MASK], already half dead with fright, was at noonday securely bound and fastened to a stake.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Yancey	“[MASK], you and your missus, you bought your furniture and so on here in my place, and what’s more, you paid cash for it. I want you as a customer, see, but not in the other branch of my business.
<name>Deacon</name>	Deacon	Yancey	She began to feel prim and good and settled at last. “Now, then,” said [MASK], all aglow, “the next thing in order is to take up the collection before the sermon.” “What for?”
<name>corn</name>	corn	Indians	There isn’t a newspaper in one of those towns—or wasn’t, when I left. I want to go back there and help build a state out of prairie and [MASK] and scrub oaks and red clay. For it’ll be a state some day—mark my words.”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Yancey	“Don’t be coarse, [MASK]. I mean ladies like myself—that I can talk to—who’ll come calling—that is----” He waved a hand this way and that. “Why, you just saw some women folks, didn’t you?”
<name>Dr. Jekyll</name>	Dr. Jekyll	Yancey	He was bareheaded. His eyes were sunken, suffering, stricken. His head lolled a little on one side. His thick black locks hung dank on his forehead. At that first instant of seeing him as he rushed out of his office, [MASK] thought, sub-
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yancey	Poisoned and enfeebled though he was, his return seemed to energize the crude little town. Wherever he might be he lived in a swirl of events that drew into its eddy all that came within its radius. Hi, [MASK]!
<name>Yakima</name>	Yakima	Nosiree	Middle of the day he’d come riding into town. No nitro-glycerin for him, or shootin’ behind fence posts and trees in the dark. [MASK]! Out in the open, and takin’ a bigger chance than them that was robbed. Ride!
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Ruby	Yet the whole portrait was colorful, moving, alive. The boy’s pose was so insolent, so lithe, so careless. The eyes followed you. He was a person. “Looks like [MASK], don’t you think?”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sabra	They’re spending their money just as the white people do when they get a handful of it—chicken and plush and automobiles and phonographs and silk shirts and jewelry.” “Why don’t they do some good with it?” [MASK] demanded.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cim	He seemed to understand her fear, her premonition, and to accept it with Oriental fatalism. “What do you want to do?” “Take me out there. Hitch up and drive me out there. [MASK]’s got the buggy. He went out with her.”
<name>The Man</name>	The Man	Yancey	He put her from him, gently, but with iron firmness, and walked out of the house, through the newspaper office, down the broad and sinister red road. [MASK] put his question wherever he came upon a little group of three or four lounging on saloon or store porch or street corner.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sabra	Suddenly the land, too, had become red: red clay as far as the eye could see. The rivers and little creeks were sanguine with it, and at sunset the sky seemed to reflect it, so that sometimes [MASK]’s eyes burned with all this scarlet.
<name>Mrs. Compson</name>	Mrs. Compson	Sabra	They drove through the yard, over [MASK]’s carefully tended grass, of which she was so proud, right to the edge of the porch steps, and so, dragging again and pulling, they got him in, undressed him; she washed his dust-smeared face.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Sabra	But presently the eye could trace here a motif, there a figure, here a motif, there a figure. The shuttle swept back, forward, back, forward. “It’s almost time for the Jew,” [MASK] would say, looking up from her sewing.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Yancey	After she had braided it she decided to leave it in a long thick plait down her back. Audaciously she tied it with a bright red ribbon, smiling to think of what [MASK] would say. She tidied the wagon. She was frankly worried now.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yancey	The rest in the conventional boots, corduroys or jeans, and rough shirt. A slow, rhythmic motion of the jaw was evidence that a generous preliminary bite of plug served as a precaution to soothe the nerves and steady the judgment. This legal farce had already begun before [MASK] made his spectacular entrance.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Yancey	[MASK] was off and up the street every ten minutes. Returning, he would lose himself in the placing of his law library, his books of reference, and his favorite volumes, for which he contended there was not enough shelf room in the house proper.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sabra	[MASK] only turned her eyes away, searching, searching. Then she saw where the boy lay under his gay striped blanket. His face was covered, but she knew. She knew well how the slim body curled in its blankets, how it lay at night, asleep.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Sabra	Went on scuffling. [MASK] discovered that she was lame; the left leg was slightly shorter than the right. She did not limp—or, rather, hid the tendency to limp by the irritating sliding sound. Her walk was straight, leisurely, measured.
<name>Cactus</name>	Cactus	Pegler	“Nothing to be frightened of, honey. They know me. I’m no [MASK] they can scare. They don’t like my white hat, that’s the truth of it. Dared me last night down at the Sunny Southwest Saloon to wear it this morning.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sabra	They were laughing and talking and munching nuts and having altogether a delightful time of it. [MASK]’s knees suddenly became weak. She was trembling. She stumbled as she ran toward him. Her face worked queerly. The men sprang up, their hands at their hips.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cim	Already the duties of this new manner of living had become familiar. There was wood to gather, a fire to start, water to be boiled. [MASK], very wide awake now, trotted after his father, after his mother.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Sabra	But he still was a dashing sight when he sat the saddle in his black cor-duroys and his soft-brimmed black hat. He swallowed his second drink. His face seemed less drawn, his hand steadier, his whole bearing more alert. “Now listen, [MASK].
<name>Jingles</name>	Jingles	Floyd	[MASK], how about you getting a piece of deer meat for the lady, seeing she’s been cheated of her supper. Now, if you and the little fella don’t mind sittin’ up behind and before, why, I’ll take you back a ways.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sabra	“I’ll do it. Let me have a drink of whisky, will you, [MASK]? I’m dead tired.” She went past him into the dining room, without a glance at the Negro boy cowering in the kitchen.
<name>Mamma</name>	Mamma	Tracy	Of course, [MASK]’s only fifty-one, and you being nineteen, there’s plenty of time if you’ll just be patient.” She was too amused to be really disturbed. “I don’t intend to be patient, Mamma darling.”
<name>Pollyanna</name>	Pollyanna	Cim	That perjury, thieving, trickery, gun play, and murder had gone into the acquiring of these—as well as many other—sites was not considered important or, for that matter, especially interesting. The dwelling itself looked like one of [MASK]’s childish drawings of a house.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Yi	Whoop-ee! [MASK]!” Plumes whirling, parasols bobbing, skirts flying, shrill shouts and screams of laughter from the edge of town. But on the return drive their behavior was again seemly enough, their cheeks flushed with a natural color beneath the obvious red.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Sabra	“ ‘The world of things that are here,’ ” echoed [MASK], not bitterly, but with grave common sense. “Perhaps if you’d pay more attention to those, and less to your nonsense in books about gold and silver and ivory, we might get settled.”
<name>Jay</name>	Jay	Yancey	A hundred times [MASK] could have bought an oil lease share for a song. Head lolling on his breast, lids lowered over the lightning eyes, he shrugged indifferent shoulders. “1 don’t want the filthy muck,” he said. “It stinks.
<name>The Kid</name>	The Kid	Sabra	echoed [MASK], the literal. “Mighty little water I’ve seen around here—unless you call that desert prairie the ocean.” “And so it is, my pet. That’s very poetic of you. The prairie’s an ocean of land.”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Sabra	[MASK], glancing at the group from beneath her shielding hat brim, did see that they were behaving much like a lot of snickering schoolboys who are preparing to let fly a bombardment of snowballs. There was nudging, there was whispering, an air of secret mischief afoot.
<name>Elijah</name>	Elijah	Mose	“An’ de angel say to him, he say, ‘[MASK], come on up on dis’ya throne an’ eat ’case yo’ hongry, an’ drink ’case yo’ parch, and res’ yo’ weary an’ achin’ feet. ..’ ”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Yancey	She must have dozed off, for suddenly the sun’s rays were sharply slanted, and she shivered with the cool of the prairie night air. Voices had awakened her. Three horsemen had dashed out of a little copse and stood in the path of [MASK]’s lead wagon.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Yancey	Suddenly she began to dress again with icy fumbling fingers. She did up her hair, put on her hat and a jacket. She closed the door behind her, locked it, slipped the key into the mail box. The Wigwam office. [MASK] was not there.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Yancey	She wanted to waken the child for comfort, for company. She summoned courage to go to the window; peered fearfully out into the dim street below. Nothing. No one in the street. [MASK]’s bleeding body was not lying in the road; no masked men.
