<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Anthony	The consequent enthusiasm was loud and prolonged. The major, who had won a month’s pay, insisted that the captain should join him and his companions in celebrating so remarkable an event. The artillery. he maintained, had been gloriously upheld. [MASK] participated in the reflected glory.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anthony	“Give me that doll,” said the captain making a sudden drunken dash at his wife. She closed the panel in his face. With some difficulty [MASK] got him back to his bunk where he sat sweating. He mixed him some hot grog and got him to lie down.
<name>Woggle-Bug</name>	Woggle-Bug	McNab	“And now I shall prove to you that [MASK] is wrong.” He pulled a fine gold watch out of his bright yellow waistcoat and looked at it. “You have seven minutes before the bell rings to finish your breakfast.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ferdinando	From sheer nervousness and pity he began to shed a few tears. [MASK] looked at him with contempt. They carried the old warrior to a hut together. “You will not say anything about this, will you?” said the priest humbly.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Faith	• [MASK] returned with the posset cup. He drank silently. “You’ll leave this light here?” she asked as he rose again. “I’ll get some more candles. He’s sleeping soundly enough now.” The old man nodded and left.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Faith	She stood poised there for a moment, with her head drawn back, before she stepped out of them. He saw she was beautiful. For some seconds he did not realize that it was [MASK]. Then he gasped. In the moonlight she was another person.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Anthony	Everything that could be done for the baby was now completed. As an impeccable candidate for the communion of saints it and its family and friends departed, leaving [MASK] leaning against the pillar hopelessly. Suddenly he realized he was being left in darkness.
<name>John</name>	John	Vincent	For a minute the grim, grotesque shadow of the postilion and his horses, the post-chaise and its vacant windows stood waiting, leaning forward a little, projected on a blank wall across the narrow street by the lantern [MASK] had left on the curb.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gallegos	He had simply come to regard [MASK], and his own little garden-valley in particular, as a kind of Gethsemane. It was a place where after much agony he prayed and waited, sure of the glory of failure—meanwhile doing what good he might according to his plan.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Neleta	There was a certain fascination in having attained it against the entire scheme of things; in maintaining a successful defence against a perpetual siege. When he entered the room, completely at ease about his understood isolation with the woman who shared it with him, [MASK] was asleep.
<name>Watteau</name>	Watteau	Guido	He knew the exact spot where it stood. Just next to that vile medallion by [MASK]. . . . But a slight trembling of his wife’s eyelids reminded him that some more direct attention to the subject of so admirable a reverie was now in order.
<name>Baedeker</name>	Baedeker	Pellicier	He pored over a guide-book written by [MASK] which the innkeeper sold to his guests for ten francs. Page eleven daunted him: “I would like to have something. I am tired.” “Have a chair,” replies the Spanish innkeeper.
<name>Prendick</name>	Prendick	Anthony	[MASK] found himself with that vision still seared on his eyeballs while he sat high up in the limbs of one of the trees. His action had been absolutely automatic. The tail of the beast went battering about down below. It jarred the thick tree perceptibly.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Anthony	When [MASK] came up with his sextant a few hours later both the deck and the horizon were momentarily clear. Taking advantage of a patch of clear sky just at noon, when the scud which had been driving for some hours luckily opened out overhead, he made his first observation at sea.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	In the continued presence of [MASK] at the convent she saw many and increasing difficulties. Above all she hoped that he might now return without having caused any talk. Her school was in too flourishing a condition to be blown upon by gossip.
<name>Traddles</name>	Traddles	Meyier	Must the old dogs and young ones always be snapping at each other?” exclaimed [MASK]. He tucked his papers under one arm and led them both toward the door with a certain air of triumph. “This is a lucky meeting, you know,” he went on.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Spanish	And with the dapper young undersecretary, glad enough to be able to chatter [MASK] unreservedly, they soon found themselves admitted to the “cour des ambassadeurs” and pressing forward to the ropes with the families of the legations seated amid flapping foreign ensigns behind.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Denis	For a moment she was all activity. She seized the candle and rushing to the window held it there waiting beat by beat of her pulses for an answering light. But there was no light whatever at the farm. Where was [MASK]? Not in his room!
<name>John</name>	John	Anthony	[MASK] had his desk, his library, and his papers there. In that place the master of Silver Ho was to be at home—and his son and his son’s sons after him. At that date one still peered into the future with some promise of permanence.
<name>Annette</name>	Annette	Lucia	How long ago it seemed. How this afternoon had changed everything. It was almost gone! The sun was behind the forest. It was getting cool. There was the voice of [MASK] calling anxiously. “Madame, Maa-dame!” They must part.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Anthony	A parrot with a cloth thrown over it on a stand near by took its head out from under its wing and began to caw and cackle. Eventually it clawed off the cloth and began to cock its eye at [MASK]. It was the most gorgeous thing he had ever seen.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Carlo	Farewell, farewell!” “You should have waited for the supper tomorrow night, a great supper! I will send along some of the wine. Drink to , . .” [MASK]’s voice called after them as the boat flashed out from the dock.
<name>And</name>	And	Whither	He could see that along with the vast majority he had unconsciously temporarily suspended his own will in order to drift with a new tide in the affairs of men. [MASK] he did not seem to care. It was a relief; easier just to watch and see what would happen to him.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Cibo	They dozed a little, awoke, talked quietly but eagerly, and dozed again. They were both at home. For [MASK] had about him a gift, a physical and mental quality of being that put you at your ease. It was not exercised, it existed.
<name>Yokohama</name>	Yokohama	Genoa	But the delay at [MASK] had advanced his potable calendar considerably, and she foreboded his early and complete retirement to the cabin in no very complacent mood. Meanwhile she sat there reduced to silence, minding her knitting, and brushing away an occasional mist of stinging tears.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Anthony	[MASK] still hoped to work through one role into the other. In a curious way, which only his own personality could envisage and contain, he entered upon this attempt by taking part in one of the greatest international financial intrigues of the time. It was a great plot.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Anthony	Life was full of things like that for [MASK], happenings that seemed to hide their true significance in a mist of impersonal memory always about to be clear. If he could only remember what he had forgotten! For a long while he kept trying to do so.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Anthony	“Well,” said he, “since you have joined my party, I suppose you will have no objection to joining the one going on downstairs. No!” He laughed and put [MASK]’s sealed copies back in the portfolio.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Napoleon	They looked at each other and smiled. She stooped and started to pick up her score again. She rearranged it and put it back on the pianoforte. The wind had scattered it badly when [MASK] had gone out—the winds of the world.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Amah	At last having settled all to his liking, including the ostrich, [MASK] rode to the head of the procession and tossed his cloak in the air. At this signal the whole howling host precipitated itself toward the residence like a dark flood.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Sancho	For a moment his hand did not leave the door-knob. So [MASK] had lied then. Or the ruffians he had hired to waylay the coach had sold-out. It was only the servants that had been murdered. The details could be ascertained later.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jane	The mill had stopped. Dreaming? Why wake up? How happy he and [MASK] had been until ... let him hear the child’s feet again. Dead! Oh, yes, he had forgotten! He was afraid he might hear them again, at night.
<name>Maqroll</name>	Maqroll	Anthony	Thousands of square miles of salt lagoons and an entire river basin were to be filled in a few hours, and all through one lean nostril. It appeared to [MASK] that the slight rise in the forest beyond was where the earth was expanding its chest in order to inhale the tide.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anthony	Indeed, he would have ceased coming to the house on the hill altogether if it had not been that he longed to do all he could for [MASK]. He was not able to break the clutch of the fever.
<name>Chiltern</name>	Chiltern	Anthony	May I ask you to point out the lady whom you wish to bet I will sit with?” With great misgivings [MASK] pointed her out. “Corpo de Bacco,” cried the count. “It is the angel of constipation herself!”
<name>Three</name>	Three	Madame	Three would bring him to her immediately if need be, no matter what.” “[MASK]!” there was an almost frantic note in the maid’s voice now. He made her cry out. Then she had broken away and vanished up the stairs.
<name>His</name>	His	Llis	He was putting roses on the altar before the god of love. She leaned forward now to see his face—and found herself gazing directly into the eyes of her husband. [MASK] lips parted slowly in a completely self-possessed smile. She gasped slightly.
<name>Lebedeff</name>	Lebedeff	Ouvrard	“He became only moderately rich,” put in [MASK] laughing. “Well, what more do you want me to do for you, gentlemen? I do not suppose, of course, that you came here to express your gratitude.
<name>God</name>	God	Gad	I had to be carried out and I assured him with tears in my eyes I was not a French agent. “By [MASK], I never thought so,” said he. “None of them they send to me can drink above four decanters.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Anthony	They fairly-flashed by a ship where the heads of the watch lined the rail. The rollicking voice of the young Spaniard made the six negroes pull as one man. At every stroke [MASK] felt the light, soft air cool against his cheeks.
<name>She</name>	She	Anthony	Afterwards we shall put them by in a drawer and converse”—he pointed upwards dramatically —“in the language which is useful up there. You see those nine women dancing about the gentleman with the lyre?” [MASK] nodded. “We shall meet them,” said he.
<name>Jurgis</name>	Jurgis	Anthony	“That they don’t, my friend. It’s dogs’ leavings we get—but you’re the first caged bird I ever heard worryin’ about what the jailers get!” “Here’s a dollar for you,” said [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Fie	Looking up, she saw his scarlet stained features apparently glaring out of the ceiling from a circle of light. [MASK] set the lantern down and took her hands to raise her. Her mouth that reminded him now of his grandmother’s in her coffin twitched slightly.
<name>McWhirter</name>	McWhirter	Vincent	We shall take the first opportunity of getting you off. A neutral ship would be best now if one happens along. The neutrals will profit by these troubles. But we shall see. Here comes your friend [MASK] bubbling with news.”
<name>Varvara</name>	Varvara	Pierre	Tell that man of mine,” said he to [MASK], “and don’t allow him anything but table wine tonight. I shall go to the springs first thing in the morning. My dear, I shall soon be well! I feel sure of it.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Denis	The mayor-postmaster must have been more than usually impressive. Best of all, the window of his room, [MASK] noticed, had a clear and uninterrupted view across the park and of the entire front of the chateau. That fact, he thought, might have strategic possibilities.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Anthony	“You make a mock of me, signore?” gasped the old man. “I did not lie to you in the cemetery. They are my children there.” “I love you,” said [MASK] and kissed his dirty, smeared old face.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Anthony	Neither said anything for a while. On both of them had fallen a great peace. It seemed to [MASK] that now he was free of the past forever. But the clock went on. It was after midnight. It was the morning of July 14, 1796.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Simba	All this he took for granted. How long was it going to last? he wondered. Nothing had ever lasted very long before, he remembered. They always went on to some place else. But he could not bear to think of leaving [MASK].
<name>Ramon</name>	Ramon	McNab	He will want to sell you the old casa, but don’t buy. Watch yourself, for he is brilliantly canny. Oh— there are also the legacies to some of the old servants, under the will. I see [MASK] comes off well.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Anthony	But it was now a scene of great animation. Down the aisle between the desks had appeared as if by magic a long table at which were seated a crowd of about twenty men varying in years from youth to middle age. They ate steadily and heartily of dishes strange to [MASK].
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	“I would rather see you here tonight than an archangel. Where have you fallen from?” He came forward and put his hands on [MASK]’s shoulders and looked up into his face. “I used to look down at you. You remember?”
<name>Snuffles</name>	Snuffles	Sancho	He sat in the only chair with a bare table before him and [MASK] curled up at his feet. The latter was fast asleep as near the fire as he could get. His damp coat steamed while he snored with a kind of continuous purr.
<name>Allonby</name>	Allonby	Maria	But she, too, desired to study his face again. She had already-formed conclusions of her own. In her case there was no point of honour beyond which speculation was taboo. Quite the contrary. The maid of [MASK] had no doubts about the family resemblance.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Debriille	[MASK] was genuinely glad to see him—there could be no doubt about that. He came forward with great warmth but with the dignity of a man well past middle-age who still carried himself well. Age had done a great deal for him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	[MASK] smoothed out the dent on the pillow where his head had been and put on his clothes. In the big room they were already at breakfast. The court lay quiet and serene in the morning sun with the shadows withdrawing from it as if by magic.
<name>Monsieur</name>	Monsieur	monseigneur	Noticing the crest on the outside panel for the first time, the man by the road licked his lips and hastened to correct himself. “But yes, [MASK],” he gasped, “the Chateau de Besance is scarcely half an hour’s drive.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Smith	“Did you hear anything?” There was a terrible silence. “Tell me.” “Yes,” said [MASK], moving his seared face frightfully. “Well ?” He dug both heels into the earth. “What ?” “Three pistol shots.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Anthony	The deposition in bad, bare, legal Latin took on for the boy the fascination of a literary masterpiece of which he was the hero. “And on the next day following the said male infant, parents unknown, was baptized [MASK] ...”
<name>Ramon</name>	Ramon	Ferdinando	“I have come myself this time to be sure you hear the truth. It is much worse than you think. That man [MASK] is a half-breed wolf. He would sell his own children. Everything 1 He and his sister—caramba!
<name>Oh</name>	Oh	Pshaw	He sat down and began to ponder. A long time passed. He was annoyed with himself for having allowed his rage to reduce him to so rudimentary a procedure. He had forgotten how fragile youth was. How sensitive he had been as a boy! [MASK]!
<name>Hurrah</name>	Hurrah	Farewell	The berlin strained forward through the mud. Children ran up the street after it holding out their hands and screaming. One persistent little urchin who raced with them half a mile finally got a coin the size of his little toe nail. “[MASK]!”
<name>Lord</name>	Lord	O.	Does he desire it? It will be a magnificent one. I enclose the drawings which cost me £6, 8s, and I should like to be reimbursed whether [MASK] takes the coach or not. Kindly convey my respects to him, and tell him so.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucia	The days slipped by. The motion of the rapidly driven coach began to make her seasick. [MASK] began to be anxious. She questioned madame. She observed. Yes, there could be no doubt of it. There was already the difference of one eyelet in lacing.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Francois	Come this way and you shall have what you want. It shall be the private chamber upstairs. Here, [MASK], give me your lantern and get the other from the settle.” Unlocking a narrow door that opened into the court the innkeeper led the way.
<name>Sharpe</name>	Sharpe	Anthony	They could drop the ship downstream at dawn if necessary. It was uncomfortable sitting still, but risking grounding on a flat in the darkness was worse. The shooting continued for some time and then stopped. “About an hour till dawn, I take it,” said [MASK].
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Anthony	“Enough to get home on!” [MASK] looked appealingly at the young Jew who was regarding the little drama before him quizzically. “Stay and get rich, monsieur,” said the Hebrew with sudden sympathy, his smile vanishing. “Why not?”
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Florence	He had no doubt what had happened. He knew. Otherwise they would have come to meet him before this. He sat on his horse, waiting to go mad . . . “Why was there nobody here? The niggers might run away, of course.” “[MASK]!
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Denis	What had he done that as the man’s hand left his own [MASK] seemed to have lost touch with life! He felt older and alone. He rode down over the slope. It had rained the night before and there was a pool by the gate.
<name>Quarrell</name>	Quarrell	Jane	The captain’s voice was pleading now. “Give it to her, [MASK]. Let her have it.” A swift horrible scream tore the darkness. It was impossible to hear it and not to partake of a fear that went like cold to the marrow.
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Anthony	“Certainly,” cried [MASK]. “I knew you would. You are a man of imagination. There is nothing to prevent your taking our first cargo, for instance, and keeping all of it. But that would be the end, wouldn’t it?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Denis	Here was a burden which she knew she would after all have to bear alone. Every night, and every night they looked for the candle in [MASK]’ window. There were no more letters. It seemed aeons since she had seen him.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Anthony	, [MASK] pocketed the key and went on deck. He was delighted with himself for several reasons. The capture of Polypheme in so ignominious a manner was an enormous stroke of luck. More important, however, was a discovery about himself.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Vincent	On the surge of his own notes he recovered himself. His voice rang out clearly. He could blend it with [MASK]’s beautifully. For another moment he was gayly happy. But this time with a new poignance.
<name>Rearden</name>	Rearden	Anthony	Give him a new pallet and he can lay it on the stone bench there. That will at least be outside,” he mused. “Take off the chain and don’t use it unless”—he looked at [MASK] significantly—“he offers to make trouble for you.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Maria	The results, however, had not been so satisfactory as he had hoped. At present it seemed as if [MASK] would lose her mind instead of the child. A demented wife was not in the scope of his plans. Hence, there was to be a sufficient interval of quiet.
<name>Waring</name>	Waring	Terrini	A mist came over his eyes. He experienced the sensation of being at home. [MASK] leaned forward. He would give anything to catch that expression for a copy of the young St. John he was doing. The face of the original he worked from was blurred.
<name>Horatio</name>	Horatio	Anthony	It was this kind of thing, he thought, that made it profitable for a nobleman to have become a merchant. That afternoon on the dock [MASK] was able to understand why the hull of the Unicorn looked so aged and battered while aloft all was new with a varnished spick-and-spanness.
<name>Hey</name>	Hey	Hola	The man did not seem to realize at first that they intended to board. Only when they glided up and made fast to the small boat drifted against the schooner’s stern did he suddenly straighten himself up. “[MASK]. what do you want?”
<name>Flint</name>	Flint	Anthony	“I wonder you did not think of it before. But I shall do my best,” he added hastily, seeing [MASK] scowl. “Have your crew pile their arms on the deck then, as I said, and get into the boats one at a time.
<name>Zorro</name>	Zorro	Anthony	Suddenly they saw the three strangers at the door and the room grew quiet. The young priest walked forward and touched [MASK] on the shoulder. “I see we both serve the same master, senor,” said he. “Am I right ?”
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Sancho	At dawn the coach started upward. [MASK] rejoiced as only a Spaniard can at finding himself on the back of a mule. The whip snapped damply in the morning mist. The coach advanced upward foot by foot. The torrent beside the road deepened into a dark gorge.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Juan	Over the dunes the chant of the surf sounded like deep basses intoning an elegy for a world beautiful but forgotten ages ago. At first [MASK] had kept a calendar by nicking a log every day with an axe, but he forgot to do so after a while and the log was used for firewood.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Anthony	“Come and hear how bravely I shall finish this song which has been scattered tonight,” she said and dropped her arms. “At the first night, the opening of the season, you know. I can sing it if I know you are there, [MASK].”
<name>He</name>	He	Lucia	She could not come to him tomorrow, would tell him why later. “Oh you are back again, back again,” rang her constant refrain. The pen kept saying it over and over. She did not realize how often. [MASK] took the paper and disappeared.
<name>John</name>	John	Debrulle	Your grandfather must have been a Chinaman.” It was true, the whole room burst into laughter. They had not noticed it before, but there was something Mongolian about this girl; an almond creep to her eyes. [MASK] rose and took his cape.
<name>Waiyaki</name>	Waiyaki	Neleta	As a consequence, the palm thatch of the fishers’ huts showed, even at a distance, as if covered with melting patches of snow. The hut of Ungah-gola, [MASK]’s maternal aunt, occupied the most salubrious site in the redolent town.
<name>Smollett</name>	Smollett	Anthony	He would get himself plenty of wine, see the ta-own and make his macaroni mate do the talking. “Come on, mister, let’s find victuals and drink. Lead the way. Captain’s and owner’s charges.” [MASK] was willing.
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Anthony	And the prices they brought next day at the sale! Ah! but in some ways that was not so good. The women will cry for their children.” He ended looking a little grave. “I have no doubt what you say is true,” said [MASK].
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Anthony	[MASK] did not realize it then, but to have been received thus by the white man in charge of the ship with courtesy and solicitude had reached the half-breed factor where he lived. It had conquered his pride. The sun had sunk.
<name>Wolf</name>	Wolf	Anthony	The mate was even inclined to argue. Armed with his data, however, [MASK] was firm. He pointed out the imminent danger of shipwreck on the island reefs if the present course were continued. He assumed that it would not be, and laid out the correct one.
<name>Willems</name>	Willems	Neleta	It was the drums going down-river that they had heard— after the raid! Most of the people they would carry off. “And that devil Mnombibi had been in his room that night with [MASK]!” He ground his teeth.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Vincent	At the second chorus [MASK] chimed in, carried away by the sheer, rank sentiment of it. “One night at least a wandering knight may have, Though disinherited from all the past, And bear the memory of that burning love— And bear that memory with him to the last.”
<name>Macintosh</name>	Macintosh	Bonaparte	That may be what all the excitement is about. A little hysterical to judge by the bugles and drums. I wonder what that man [MASK] thinks? What are his subject and his object? Evidently he is a kind of human verb between them.
<name>Giuseppe</name>	Giuseppe	Beppo	All that was lacking was the eggs. [MASK] had kindled the fire. A long consultation in mountain dialect, an argument, an outburst of fury on the part of the oldest woman, a loud slap in the face for the youngest granddaughter—finally began to produce results.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Lucia	She might still find [MASK] there. At any rate he was not that way. She turned to the right and crept slowdy and softly down the corridor holding the small shrine in her arms like a doll. Presently she found herself by the railing of the servants’ stairs.
<name>Talleyrand</name>	Talleyrand	Ouvrard	He was always a very busy man and so was his secretary. They set up shop for a while at the French embassy. And then, in order to salve national sensitivity and suspicion, [MASK] moved to the ground floor of the Palace of the Prince of the Peace.
<name>Maskell</name>	Maskell	Ouvrard	Afterwards he could recall very7 little of the intricate negotiations, the conflict of personalities and interests, the infinitely complex web which [MASK] spun until he was enclosed in it himself along with the flies he lured. And he doubted whether anyone else could follow it, or understand it, or remember it for long.
<name>John</name>	John	Anthony	It was only for a few seconds, but as [MASK] watched this weird little Niagara that seemed to be leaping forever out of a tropical elfland through a haze of maidenhair ferns, a gorgeous coral snake glided down to the brink of a still pool and began to drink.
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Stefano	“If it is large figures,” said [MASK], “come this way.” He led them directly across the street and up a few steps into a kind of stone lean-to with its rear wall in the rock itself.
