<name>Someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Twin	The burials now were so frequent everyone in the settlement lived almost atop shallow graves hastily dug, not even three feet from the soil’s surface, subject to uncovering by the next bad rain. [MASK] was gone again, it felt this time forever.
<name>Abilene</name>	Abilene	Ilza	[MASK] stepped forward to see after the soon-to-be-orphaned child, and late that evening, once the mother’s body went over the rail, took the boy up and added him to her own.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Eugene	This was the most she’d heard [MASK] say at one time, and the first he’d said aloud how little he wanted the farm life she had to offer. She’d failed him. Suddenly she knew it true.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Harry	A Creek rancher, a sympathizer, had given over his house to the service, and fourteen Creeks, half-breeds, and Negroes waited inside. [MASK] set his jug and his fiddle in the corner, and took to the center of the room.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Rose	She could imagine his simplistic computation; old freed-woman with a gun, young Indian man living on the property, ranch hand or drifter. “Well, I could talk to you, then,” he said to [MASK]. “No need for the rifle.
<name>Sitting Bull</name>	Sitting Bull	Rose	“Who is that man?” [MASK] asked, pointing to one of the bills. A stern-faced man dominated the left side of the note. “Same question I asked the Indian agent.” He held up the bill.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Amy	When done, she helped him stand and took the lead, pushing him forward in the search, acting as his eyes and ears. Amid the dark and confusion, they came across [MASK] ministering to the deep leg gashes of a young Creek boy who had lost both parents to the water.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jake	“What about the ranch?” “That’s the root of the fever sweeping town,” said [MASK]. “For each and every person in a family on the roll, babe or gray-head, the government promises one hundred sixty acres.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Rose	[MASK] picked up the shoes again, and ran her finger across the smooth surface of one of the sateen bows. She sniffed the leather, a raw, heady smell that filled her with satisfaction, and placed the pair in her lap, picking up her needlework again.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Rose	“Sounds like you have hereafter all figured,” [MASK] said. “Coming up, I moved from place to place, shuffled from one relative to the next when my mother couldn’t manage, one tribe to another, near starving most of the time.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Amy	He warmed to her at once, envious of the tightness of their family. She reminded him of [MASK], not in physical presence, but in her determination. He remembered how she made a place for herself without wavering, a place to keep vigilant watch over her children.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Rose	His sudden silence drove home the import of his gift to [MASK], in a way words could not, what it must mean for a man like him to give each member of his family the symbol of his life’s work.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Rose	His eyes held her fast, but [MASK] didn’t look away. He intruded on her domain, on her kitchen. More precisely, the Pennyman kitchen, but by extension of responsibility, her own as well. “Excuse me, ma’am,” he said.
<name>Rand</name>	Rand	Jake	[MASK] paused, his body still. “Speak plain, woman.” His tone sharp, she saw the tiredness of the road in his eyes, the red rising at his cheeks and neck, the slight telltale hitch of his shoulders toward his ears when he became tense or impatient.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Elizabeth	“It’s time to talk about him, is all.” [MASK] regained her composure, taking her time, picking up her stitch before responding. “Was a time I’da welcomed a word from you. Any word. All I got was silence.”
<name>Brother</name>	Brother	Rose	“Old or no. Have you forgotten the pledge? One last time, brother.” [MASK] saw a flicker of a smile play at the corners of her grandfather’s lips. He finally nodded. “One last time,” he agreed.
<name>Wovoka</name>	Wovoka	Jake	Visitors told stories of non-Indian settlers on civilized tribe lands, staking out land claims, as if entitled. “And talk of turning us into a state grows louder,” [MASK] said. “Mark my words, it’s coming.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Rose	Her sister started to fuss, but sensed tension and sat up quietly, rubbing her eyes. [MASK] was hungry, but somehow this didn’t seem the right time to broach that subject. “We can wait outside, missus.” The woman nodded.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Rose	How easy and wondrous it would be to slide and lose herself completely. [MASK] knew, with certainty absolute, that this was the beginning at last, the passageway to the life she’d waited so long to clarify.
<name>she</name>	she	Rose	Her grandfather promised nothing, indicated nothing, answering back with his raised palm to the woman, but [MASK] had seen this before, and knew he made a mental note of her location, should he prove successful freeing a blanket from the new shipment.
<name>Louisa</name>	Louisa	Rose	Make a family of your own. Make sons. Give my Amy the great-grandsons she deserves and break the curse. You are braver than you know.” [MASK] could barely absorb his words. How could he know of her dream of sons?
<name>the listener</name>	the listener	Rose	“You are willing to make affidavit to that?” “Yes, you couldn’t hardly tell the difference between her and full-blood. She could not use the English language whatever, hardly.” Some of his testimony was new information to [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Amy	A wash of emotions fought his resolve—triumph, gratitude, resentment, exhaustion, disbelief. He wanted to go immediately to [MASK], tell her he’d done this thing they’d dreamed for so many years, that her time was coming too.
<name>Mavis</name>	Mavis	Rose	“I’ve somewhere else to be,” said [MASK], “but once the cows are settled, some coffee will send me on my way.” She offered one of the baskets of cucumbers. “For you and the boys.” The widow accepted.
<name>Inej</name>	Inej	Rose	“And a padlock with a key,” [MASK] said. Her grandfather always taught her to make the most of an advantage, however brief. Should the padlock come with two keys, she intended to hold them both. “What for?”
<name>John</name>	John	Rose	“We cross here so they can’t follow in the night.” The stream was at least as wide as two full lengths of the corral back on their ranch. There was no telling how deep. [MASK] could swim, if need be, but what about the baby?
<name>him</name>	him	Twin	They might be dead tomorrow, gone forever. She went about her tasks, but walled herself in, obedient. Something shut down inside her, and she felt it as a dimming flame. She wondered if that flame could ever burn bright again, especially without [MASK] as its spark.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rose	The woman agreed. [MASK] ran ahead to the old family graveyard, and found the entire patch choked with thistle. Weeds and vines tangled in the dirt close to ground. The dull pain in her chest deepened as she cleared them away.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Harry	“That describes a lot of men in this town,” the man said. “I can carry you to the buildings where most politicians set up offices. They’re close to the Senate chambers.” “Good enough,” said [MASK].
<name>Pocahontas</name>	Pocahontas	Pocahontas	He held the bill for closer inspection, though no one was allowed to touch the tender except him. “And the woman here is an Indian princess, [MASK].” Her grandfather pointed at what looked like an eagle beginning flight at the bottom.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Elizabeth	What he’d asked of her was too much, and wrong. She wanted her grandmother to stop talking about him. “There’s gooseberry cobbler,” she said, standing. “[MASK], help me dish up.”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Rose	[MASK] came out of the shadow into the glow of the kitchen so they could see her. They stood close to one another, her sister and her husband, not touching, but with an intimacy that threatened to knock her to her knees. “Whose baby?”
<name>Maeve</name>	Maeve	Ilza	“We all thank you,” [MASK] said. He saw resolve on her dirty face. He’d seen deference to this woman by the others, and befriending her could prove prudent. “Cooks are needed,” he said.
<name>John</name>	John	Jake	“They try to make it sound good, and fair, but Indian Territory is supposed to be for us. We are Creek citizens.” “You know my thoughts.” [MASK] relit his pipe, ingesting the smoke slow and deep.
<name>McPheron</name>	McPheron	Rose	The woman had lost her husband in a gun accident the year before, and was struggling to hold on to her land. The family came to [MASK]’s attention through loose ranch-hand gossip, and for the fact that she had never thought to search out such a family before, she was ashamed.
<name>run</name>	run	Creek	“There’s nothing you can do.” She studied her son in the lantern light, this pale man-child struggling. The boy needed grounding, something gone missing in him, always trying to out-[MASK] the full-bloods.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Eugene	You’ll do what I say. No one sells.” [MASK] picked up the rifle from where she’d leaned it on the porch rail. He sighted down the barrel in the direction of the bunk-house, before laying the old gun back to rest.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Elizabeth	I am plain. A scrawny chicken.” [MASK] was already shapely, with her dimpled cheek, smooth ebony skin, and flashing eyes. A change came across her grandfather’s face, a sudden grimace that held for a brief moment before disappearing.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Rose	The blue surrounding her dimmed a shade. [MASK] forced her gaze away from the jagged rock, pressed her hands into fists and kept them tight and in control by her sides, and ran as fast as she could through the fort’s gate, never stopping once until she got home.
<name>no name</name>	no name	Osceola	She flinched. “What’s happened to your ear?” she asked, alarmed, touching the nubbed rim for the first time of many. “[MASK],” he said, but the name meant nothing to her.
<name>he</name>	he	Jake	Nothing was painless. She would be glad when [MASK] returned in a couple of weeks. He had a better sense of this than she did, although one thing was certain. Neither of them would give up one acre of their land without a fight.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Billy	Each time they returned, they saw [MASK] holding to his part of the bargain, distributing water to those crying out for it, although the boy had no real talent at the sickbed, and stopped often to rest.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Kindred	By then, they had waited well over four hours, and she resigned herself to registering [MASK] in absentia. She walked dust-clogged lanes between one area of the vast tent city to the next, careful to keep her orientation.
<name>Abuela</name>	Abuela	Elizabeth	Though still morning, the day had warmed, and she saw movement at the front of the ranch house, on the wrapped porch, a solitary figure. [MASK], in a rocking chair, embroidery in her hand. She had changed much, and yet in some ways had barely changed at all.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Bella	He hadn’t come this far to see his mother hurt again, and he shifted position, spinning [MASK] out with one arm as if a dance partner, hopefully removed from harm’s way, and jammed his hand in between the two boats, absorbing the brunt of the impact.
<name>The journalist</name>	The journalist	Harry	They exchanged a few pleasantries, and memories, until the senator pulled out his timepiece, flicking open the case to check the hour. “So. What makes you seek me out now?” he asked. [MASK] took the lead.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Faithful	[MASK] did his best to rise to the formality of the occasion, but even standing still, he swayed in place, his head seemingly too heavy for his body, his red eyes blinking against the light, the reek of alcohol escaping from his pores.
<name>something</name> (There is no clear answer or context clue to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	something (There is no clear answer or context clue to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Twin	The grave clean, she left [MASK] behind and entered into the woods softly, paying close attention to sight and sound. It was easy to go unseen in the pasture, to anticipate surprise, but the forest was a different story. She searched for a suitable tree.
<name>Levi</name>	Levi	Jake	Each time someone exited the tent, a frisson of excitement infected the waiting crowd. One family closer to registration, and the opportunity to hear impressions of what happened inside the tent. Freedmen emerged to tell the same basic tale, and the rumors [MASK] brought home were confirmed.
<name>Della</name>	Della	Rose	[MASK] peeled back the edges of the wrapping. Inside was a pair of high-top black leather shoes, fancy. A curved row of covered buttons ran up the side, each in its own buttonhole, with a small sateen bow at each toe, and dainty little heels.
<name>Celie</name>	Celie	Rose	No matter this was [MASK]’s farm, larger than her grandfather’s, that she’d been married now seven years, that she and her husband ran over fifteen hundred head of cattle, that she was mother to five healthy children, girls and boys both.
<name>Russian</name>	Russian	Mvskoke	She didn’t dare lift her head. The horses stopped a ways from her, and she heard cooldown snorts as they began to graze. “We wait,” a male voice said in [MASK], and dismounted.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Bella	He reached up and touched the pebbly texture of the birthmark on [MASK]’s face, and she let him. He winced at the pain of his bandaged hand, but the penalty was small. He may have lost three of his fingers, but he regained his mother.
<name>her</name>	her	Rose	In English.” The smell of smoke hung heavy. They passed campsite after squeezed campsite, successive precincts of idled folks. The cadence of different dialects and languages confused [MASK], but her grandfather quickly readjusted his ear and answered back in kind.
<name>Pastor</name>	Pastor	Rose	At the reminder, her grandmother shuffled forward a few steps, obedient to the sound of [MASK]’s voice, and stooped to grab a handful of soil to throw into the open grave. “He’s gone,” her grandmother said, to no one in particular.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Kindred	Since [MASK] arrived, she’d endured occasional, unexplained spells sometimes lasting an hour or more, when she could barely catch her breath and was forced to sit motionless until her heart and lungs unseized. But their blessings were so many. Their acreage prospered.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Harry	He found her humming as she performed her fruitless sweep of the filthy floor. She cut him off before he could begin. “[MASK] told me,” she said, and smiled, as if all was right with the world.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Rose	[MASK] wrapped her hands around the bedpost and squeezed so tight her fingernails sank into her own flesh, carving deep half-moon craters of dark blood. She made herself calm, willing herself not to cry out. This delivery would be easier than the others, she decided.
<name>John</name>	John	Jake	She heard the creak of the heavy barn door, and knew it was [MASK], come to her. She didn’t interrupt the course of her mourning, crying out her agony until she was spent, and he waited, not far from where she had thrown herself on a bundle of hay.
<name>and low</name>	and low	Mvskoke	The men spoke fast [MASK] to each other, punctuated and hard. Not old but young men by register and tone. She couldn’t catch all their words, but they bantered back and forth while she crouched, frozen, and she wondered who or what they waited for and how long before they moved on.
<name>tribal</name>	tribal	Dunn	He’s on our side,” he said. “Two hundred thousand dollars to sell the western section of Creek lands to the United States, divvied up per head to all on the [MASK] roll, full-blood, mixed-blood, or freedman, no distinction.
<name>John</name>	John	Jake	“We have gold coin and silver, and too many coming and going here when you’re away. Just makes good sense to put things under lock and key. We work too hard for our things to go missing.” Again [MASK] nodded, tightly.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Rose	A small smile lifted the edges of his lips, and he looked even younger than before. “So, should I come back again to see you?” he asked. [MASK] fought back a schoolgirl simper, dazzled anew by the inten- sity behind his eyes and the magnetism of his quick grin.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Kindred	[MASK] could declare himself one thing or the other, at his whim. He could deny the family that bore him, as well as the family that raised him, and in either case, pass over to a different life.
<name>White Fang</name>	White Fang	Hadjo	A week ago, when [MASK] refused her suckling, and turned from the grass at feed time, he worried she’d caught milk sickness. But now he thought it nothing more than a passing malady, without potential to hurt the tribe.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Rose	Each woman in the kitchen stopped midtask and demanded their children to their sides. Those old enough to understand moved quickly and waited obediently by their mothers’ skirts. [MASK] smelled fear in the room, but there was something else she couldn’t quite grasp that hung heavy in the cold air.
<name>Samantha</name>	Samantha	Elizabeth	[MASK] flipped her penny in the air to try to catch before it hit the ground. She missed, and scrambled under the table to retrieve the spinning coin, and when she reemerged with a scuffed knee and endearing grin, she held the penny overhead in triumph.
<name>He</name>	He	Jake	She busied herself, back and forth from the kitchen, insisting on filling each plate herself, her nerves smoothing as the chatter around the table grew comfortable. [MASK] was in his element, and entertained as if he were king and the women his subjects.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Tom	Nothing for worry. He was sure what awaited him was another meaningless chore, or errand easily assigned to one of the others. A task not worthy of a hilis haya. A healer. He was just turned twelve, mostly a man. “[MASK]!”
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Bella	They filled him in on reports of the collision, as much as they knew. Each time he woke briefly in the night, he felt a little stronger, more himself, and each time, [MASK]’s port-stained face filled him until he drifted back to sleep.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Rose	[MASK] thought of all of her secret hiding places and the familiar pastures. She imagined them now, either overgrown or in the hands of others. Her grandfather must have made the same calculation. “If you were men, I’d challenge,” he said.
<name>She</name>	She	Rose	The other agent nodded in agreement. [MASK] began to wonder if the short man had a tongue to speak at all. “Can you deny results?” asked her grandfather, defensive. “Does modern beget taller corn or better payout of cotton?
<name>Cherokee</name>	Cherokee	Creeks	That’s the only way to get the land. The allotment goes to citizens only. The call’s out to members of all nations, but they start with [MASK] first. Some full-bloods threaten harm to anyone accepting allotment.” “What do you think?
<name>Santy</name>	Santy	Bella	He rummaged around in his belongings, pulled out his fiddle, and brought it to his chin. He drew back his bow, and made up a fast and catchy tune of trills and riffs, and in a deep voice sang a refrain for a chorus whose single word was [MASK], liberally repeated.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Jake	She was dizzy with the thought. “No,” said [MASK]. “Allotment starts with land where you already made improvements. They transfer those to your name, and for the rest, you choose plots not belonging to anyone else. No guar-
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hawkins	“We are not in the market to sell.” “And a fine ranch it looks to be, if I may say so.” [MASK] looked out over the expanse, from east to west. “I see why you’d hold on to forty acres for your homestead.”
<name>she</name>	she	Rose	She knew she was foolish, but couldn’t resist. The flower would neither serve useful purpose for her grandmother’s herbal table nor at the serving table, but [MASK] loved the color and shape best of all the plants growing wild along the plains.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Rose	They tried night hunting, with poor results. Despite foraging nuts and berries along the way, their food store was low, and they cut back to half rations. But the night finally came to an end. [MASK] spotted the thread of light announcing the sun’s rise.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Rose	He might better understand the opportunities.” “My husband is back in a few weeks. I assure you, his answer is no different than mine,” said [MASK]. “But of course, you are free to try. Good day.”
<name>his family</name>	his family	Amy	He wished he could stop and explain to this black Seminole how he came to be holding that fiery torch, burning the village, threatening his sons, following orders he knew were wrong, when all he wanted was to get back to [MASK], and his girls, and his tribe.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Twin	“This place holds nothing for us anymore. We can’t stay. But wherever we go, we make a new family plot, and honor all those who’ve passed over beyond our reach. We won’t forget them. [MASK].
<name>The Swede</name>	The Swede	Five	He plunged back into the water toward the larger group on the opposite shore, taking up a waiting station at the deepest part of the stream. [MASK] waded in and staggered positions, holding guns and food and blankets over their heads, handing them daisy chain as they went back for more.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Rose	’s side in the morning when [MASK] woke, but now he was quiet, more in control of himself, more the grandfather she knew. She brought him puska and fresh water, and offered the meal to him. He accepted in silence, forcing down their precious ration with- out comment or connection.
<name>Abby</name>	Abby	Rose	“Emancipation Day,” [MASK] repeated. “Creek Council finally voted us African Creeks full citizens. Colored or red, born slave or free, now we’re members of the tribe.” “All Creeks?”
<name>She</name>	She	Amy	“I guess some families are trickier to be part of than others,” he said. [MASK] didn’t try to hide her surprise at his rare attempt at lightheartedness. And when she chuckled softly, he believed they had a chance at carrying out the scheme.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Bella	The pelting rain made visibility almost impossible, but [MASK] had been right beside him just seconds before. He dove under, but the water was so dark and there was so much debris, he made out only outlines and shifting shapes.
<name>Auri</name>	Auri	Rose	“I’m not you,” [MASK] said, her voice small. “Not much time remains,” he said. “This body tires. But you will sit with me each day. You will listen until my voice gives out.
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jumper	He forced himself to straighten up, as if momentarily caught off guard by nothing more than a wasp’s prick, of little consequence. He stifled both the scream of pain and the scream of terror competing to surface. [MASK] stepped forward.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Rose	Our family needs that power too. Let it go. You won’t break.” How much easier for [MASK] if she could talk to her grandmother, tell her about the torching of the Seminole villages. Her grandfather as murderer. If she could explain why she remained silent.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Yargee	“With what you hold, and the sale last week of the sick steer I nursed through, and today’s add. There is enough.” “Enough?” asked [MASK]. “Did we say $450?”
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Rose	“Allotment starts with land where you already made improvements. They transfer those to your name, and for the rest, you choose plots not belonging to anyone else. No guar- antee where additional plots are, but everybody gets their full allotment.” [MASK]’s mind was already at work.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Bella	“I was told where to find you,” he said. His face quickly went from pale to a rosy pink, and he pulled off his jacket. “Hot in here.” He looked around at the disarray, despite [MASK]’s best attempts at cleaning.
<name>Home</name>	Home	Twin	The world had become dim gray sky above and mile after mile of spongy mud below. Wet grass slapped against her face and chilled air forced its way inside the woven blanket around her shoulders, and her ears filled with the steady footbeats of the others. Every step took them farther away from [MASK].
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Bella	He hadn’t time in the packed day to figure out much of anything, including how to handle [MASK]. But next he knew, the firemen were yelling, blaming each other for letting the fires burn too low, rushing in and then out again to carry more wood to the boiler room.
<name>she</name>	she	Rose	Far from the nearest mill, they pounded their own corn, ginned the cotton with their fingers, and carded by hand before [MASK] and the other women spun. “You work at a disadvantage,” the tall agent finally said.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Rose	Or year after.” [MASK] nodded. “Whenever,” she said. “We’ll be ready.” '~ty C2- THEY CLEARED THE FULL DAY, LEAVING SHORTLY AFTER sunup, once the boys milked the cows and the most pressing chores were done.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Elizabeth	If one of her children needed her, especially a helpless baby of six months, nothing and no one could stop her. Not man nor woman nor beast. Certainly not one single word spoken, no matter by whom. [MASK] was weak.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Maggie	“Get them all out of here. Find someplace else to stay.” His face crumpled at the sight of [MASK], and he comprehended the scene in a glance. He moved to pack up some belongings for the move.
<name>December</name>	December	June	They’d thought the war and his stint of service would be over months ago, a short-term rental before relocation to Indian Territory with his family by February, in time to resettle and plant for the new season. And here it was [MASK], yet dragging on.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Harry	He was determined to try to atone for his past failings, to be a better man, a sober man, to take up [MASK]’s good example. He wasn’t yet free, but now, at least, he was saved.
