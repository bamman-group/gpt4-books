<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Misra	Somehow, I felt I knew I had to betray one of them. I had to betray either [MASK], who had been like a mother to me, or my mother country. However, part of me was worried — worried that a curse would be placed on my head by either.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Salaado	At table, [MASK] told the story of a schoolmate of hers who once said, in the presence of at least a dozen of his classmates, that he was going to commit suicide. He gave the precise day, date and minute when he would.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Misra	gallant about your gaze — gentle, formal, sweet, but gallant.” I said, “It’s very kind of her.” She said, “I told her about [MASK].” “What do you mean? Do you know any more than we do?”
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Misra	“I am not sure if you are sorry,” I said, teasing her as before. In silence, we listened to the crickets call to one another. A little later, [MASK] was moving about, preparing a bath for me.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Karin	So, would the old man finish, in elegance, all he had planned to do — wash, pray, say a few devotions, make a number of wishes, give his dardaaran to his [MASK] and, if it pleased him, tell her that time was up?
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hilaal	Why do you think that is so?” And you addressed the question to no one in particular. [MASK] was beyond himself with delight. You were well, your head was working, you were thinking and were not morose, silent, withdrawn. You were fun.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Misra	You wondered if the man had made sense to the others since you didn’t understand him. You were looking at the other faces for clues when [MASK]’s image came right before you, placing itself between you and the men you were staring at.
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Misra	[MASK]’s recounting of what I was like, what I did, coupled with what she was like, what she was doing — these encase me like a womb and I try unsuccessfully to break loose. It is hard to accept or reject when you are told things about yourself as a child.
<name>Miss Kenton</name>	Miss Kenton	Misra	A fortnight later, he thought of new games, which attracted larger audiences. [MASK] heard that the young man in her charge had been up to no good. And there was no way she could’ve held him in the house. What was the point of beating him?
<name>Katerina</name>	Katerina	Misra	He was numb in soul and body. He knew the rest of the story. She needn’t bother. [MASK] had fallen in love with a man from the enemy camp and she had betrayed. There were deaths. There was a massacre. Houses were razed to the ground.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Askar	Then, like somebody who derives courage from the certainty of death and who says, “What’re you waiting for? Kill me, shoot me, get on with it and quick too,” [MASK] said, “Go on. Tell me the worst.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Salaado	But why a shark? And [MASK] thought, I like this woman’s imagination, it is wide, it is encompassing, it is inclusive, it is larger than the world of which she isn’t an integral part. Why a shark?
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Misra	“It wasn’t clean, was it?” you wondered, springing upon [MASK] a question she wasn’t in the least ready for. “It was blood and pain and struggle all the way to the end for the old man, wasn’t it?”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Misra	I let go of [MASK] and, with self-abandon, roamed about in the newly discovered land, thinking not of her, but of pain. It rained a lot and the rain levelled the terrain which wiped out the readable maps, the recognizable landmarks and milestones.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Riyo	[MASK] was delightfully surprised to see your collection of maps and books. She also envied you the space you had in the house — a room all to yourself. She had known of these before, but confessed she didn’t believe them to be true.
<name>Madame Sosostris</name>	Madame Sosostris	Misra	In depthless water, too, it was I saw my future. I had it read by [MASK] who was exceptionally gifted in this sort of line — reading one’s future in the waves of water or in the quiver of meat or in a pool of blood.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Askar	She said, “But that’s not all.” Second deaths are more painful when you come to think of it, thought [MASK]. He was numb in soul and body. He knew the rest of the story. She needn’t bother.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Askar	“Now, [MASK]. Why can’t you collaborate?” she said, in my opinion putting the blame squarely on me. “Why don’t you simply acknowledge the fact that I taught you to read and write? Why don’t you admit that you know the alphabet backwards and forwards?”
<name>Pharaoh</name>	Pharaoh	Askar	The tall constable, who took upon himself to lead the last ten metres of the walk, wore an anklet of shadows round his feet, treading on stirred memories of ([MASK]’s) dust. They entered the station in silence.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Misra	But you weren’t alert enough to note a discrepancy in this and [MASK]’s true story. For she had her own child who died at the age of eighteen months. Nor did you ever ask her why she told you this fictitious version. Or is your own memory untrustworthy?
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Misra	And he made unnecessary noises so I would wake up. I wouldn’t. Not until [MASK] went out of the room to cry outside. I heard her crying and I awoke. I looked this and that way.
<name>John</name>	John	Askar	They’ve condemned unjusdy and asked for no evidence. What do you say to that?” [MASK] sat silently, staring at his lap as though his ruined logic had fallen there. Would he be able to gather his broken pieces into his cupped hands and then respond?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Something	[MASK] claimed his attention and he moved away from you, disregarding all your attempts at reaching him. Until you started saying, “I’ve never seen the woman of whom I speak thus, except once, and even then, I saw the back of her neck and no more.
<name>Somalia</name>	Somalia	Askar	A nation with a split personality, [MASK]. How tragic! Of course, the economic and political considerations are to be given their due weight and they are important. But it is the psyche of the Somali — his peace of mind and that of the community — these matter a great deal more.”
<name>violence</name>	violence	Hilaal	“The trouble is,” and here his voice assumed an inordinate calmness which he had got from being close to [MASK], “in gruesomeness, massacres are all the same wherever in the world they occur. And at the centre of them all, there is a traitor.
<name>He</name>	He	Askar	[MASK] thought he had seen the man before. Then he turned to face her so he could ask if she too had known him. Alas! She was not there any more, not only was she not there, but she wasn’t in his memory either.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Misra	When neighbours or relations who had overheard my tumultuous cries the previous night asked after me the following morning, [MASK], generous and loving, would not speak of the inconveniences I had caused her, nor would she speak of the visitor who had called after midnight.
<name>Flannery</name>	Flannery	Misra	It’s a strange sensation but that’s what I feel. No fresh ideas. And my eyes — look at them. Pale as white meat.” [MASK] thought, it is the bad eye. All that night, she prayed and prayed and prayed.
<name>wife</name>	wife	Misra	He said, “Where on earth were you returning from early this morning, [MASK]?” Unperturbed, she mumbled something, as wives do when their husbands put indiscreet questions to them in public. Perhaps she suggested they postpone their argument until later.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Misra	Oh what a fool, I thought to myself, when I got the joke. But I couldn’t laugh to my heart’s content because he had already moved on further afield, picking ripe fruits off trees older than the one planted by [MASK] the day I was bom.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Venus	He heard himself say “I am”, and the echo returned to him a sound which he found to be meaningful. Now he looked up to see if “[MASK]” too had vanished. Here he wasn’t totally disappointed — but in a peculiar way curiously reflective.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Askar	[MASK] rushed to the toilet before he wet himself. Jn He was in a garden which was lush with foliage and plants with memories of their own. And he recognized the tree that had the same birthday as himself, he sat in its shade which was sweet, ate what he could of its ripe fruits.
<name>Al-Shabaab</name>	Al-Shabaab	Defeat	“He was seen entering or leaving her compound. She was seen with him in public. He was known to be a cruel man, insisting that they raze to the ground villages harbouring pro-Somali saboteurs. [MASK] had already created disharmony among the Kallafo townspeople.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Misra	Then you would take a handful of the earth surrounding it and you would take a mouthful of its nourishment, making sure [MASK] wasn’t watching you, believing, of course, that eating earth would do you a world of good, and that you would grow taller and heftier, just like the tree.
<name>he</name>	he	Askar	Uninitiated, it took him longer and the man repeated the greetings formula a couple of times until [MASK] was ready to hear and understand. The man continued: “We met but briefly, you and I, my son.
<name>Gene</name>	Gene	Aria	Not until I met my mother’s brother, who told me that water had the same sort of satanic fascination for my mother, [MASK]. She had endangered her own life so many times that in the end, he decided to teach her to swim.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Misra	I was overcome by fear — fear of pain, fear of being lonely, fear of being separated forever from [MASK]. (She wasn’t there anyway; she wasn’t allowed to come. In her place, there came a man, one of my many uncles.)
<name>God</name>	God	Misra	I slept with the Sacred Word sweet on my tongue and awoke chewing it in place of [MASK]’s profane name. In secret, I would drink the writings which I had washed off the slate, believing it would help retain the Word’s wisdom, a day, a week or a month longer.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Misra	She said that we could play hide-and-seek until I fell asleep. She hid; I sought her out. § VII Did I, in the act of looking, bring into being a world in which there existed not only [MASK] but many other persons as well?
<name>Her</name>	Her	Misra	For [MASK], and therefore for me too, everything had a past, a present, and a future. The earth had its history, the sun its life, the moon its pattern of behaviour. Blood. Sand. Dry leaves, dry twigs.
<name>she</name>	she	Misra	He couldn’t now remember for the life of him what explanation [MASK] had given, but could remember thinking about her periods whenever he stood by the tree in their compound and saw its life flow into waste and he tasted the sap and was coincidentally sick the follow-
<name>someone</name>	someone	Misra	Suddenly, just when I was about to start wondering why he was talking nervously and continuously, he paused. I thought he, too, was anxious about [MASK]’s disappearance and this was why he was talking non-stop. But he surprised me.
<name>John</name>	John	Salaado	Then, “We have no children, [MASK] and I,” he said. “Or rather, we didn’t have any before you joined us. That’s right. We’re not bothered by the fact that we didn’t have any of our own.
<name>violence</name>	violence	Misra	There was no tension in him. No memory of [MASK]. No bitterness, no taste of blood or guilt in his mouth. If anything, he was happy. He was wrapped in the skin of a goat whose meat he was sure he had eaten.
<name>The librarian</name>	The librarian	Misra	He had given this serious thought and requested that someone, preferably an adult, answer his query: “He may be a snake in body and appearance although he is a human relation in all other aspects that are not easily revealed to you or I — is this possible?” [MASK] had answered, yes.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Uncle	He asked her what gifts I might like. She looked at me considerately, silently. [MASK] looked from her to me and then back at her. Was she saying that I was now a man and I could decide for myself? Maybe.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Misra	Not even when [MASK] was helped to abort, not even when a calendar was brought into the compound and when circles in green were neady drawn round the safe days and nights. An ovum lives for less than thirty-six hours, sperm for about twenty-four.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Misra	And neither did [MASK] bother about you, when you were such a small boy yourself. Now, you could see how self-conscious she was, how prudent in her self-preservation, how cautious in her mannerisms, how womanly aware of the man in you.
<name>Tita</name>	Tita	Misra	Then, the following morning, the women made [MASK] lie on her back and they trampled all over her body. As if that wasn’t enough, they made her sit up and be fumigated with cardamom and then improvised for her a suppository of cinnamon with myrrh.
<name>Marthe</name>	Marthe	Misra	Placing his “rifle” in his bed, he stood motionless, thinking. A little later, he began moving about, quiet as the smoke of gunpowder, and he lit a paraffin lamp. He strode towards [MASK]’s bed to wake her up.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Askar	A shot would sound ([MASK] couldn’t tell where the shot was coming from or who was firing it), the piece of meat would emanate from on high like birds in flight, dropping faeces of fright. Six out of ten, the dog got the meat.
<name>Eve</name>	Eve	Adam	After all, she was created from his rib, flesh and blood — in him, her beginning. [MASK]’s beginnings are in the command (i.e. the Word): Be! And he became. He was.” I yawned. They left the room.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Misra	I thought I had seen her earlier, when not particularly looking for her. Now I went to the same spot. And there was something strange — I felt stupid when I realized that I had been talking to [MASK]’s dress though she wasn’t there herself.
<name>him</name>	him	Askar	His mind wandered — he watched with fascination a woman on “fours”, a woman crawling playfully towards the child, and, following lustily in the woman’s wake, there was a man. It didn’t matter to [MASK] if the child was theirs.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Hilaal	[MASK] appeared pleased with your robust state of mind. He was happy your enthusiasm was again ablaze with the same kind of informed argumentativeness as before and that you were like your old self again. He commented: “I’ve never heard it told so elegantly.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Salaado	At first, neither knew what to say nor what kind of sigh of horror to utter. Then they looked at each other and communicated their sense of inner torment to one another. [MASK] went and knelt beside her in prostrated quietness, saying nothing, doing nothing — but evidently apologetic.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a person whose name is not mentioned.)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a person whose name is not mentioned.)	Misra	As I grew older and met more and more of these people, I decided I would refrain from calling [MASK] anything until we were in the privacy of our room, so she could address me, or I her, however each liked.
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Askar	Besides, it is easier to suspect the foreigner amongst a community than one’s own cousin or brother. But I swear upon [MASK]’s life that I did not inform on the freedom fighters’ movements or on their camp of sojourn.”
<name>David</name>	David	Askar	What I am trying to say, inarticulately, all this time, is you need more than scientific evidence for you to disown the woman who, for the first few years of your fife, you called “Mother”. Think, [MASK].
<name>someone</name> (There is no context or information given to suggest a specific name.)	someone (There is no context or information given to suggest a specific name.)	Misra	I scrambled over to the other side of the bed and sat on the edge, my feet danglingly touching the floor. It was such a plague to think that I would finally be separated from [MASK] and the thought gripped my heart and played tricks with its beating rhythm.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Misra	Once a month, for five, six, and at times even seven days, [MASK] looked pale, appeared to be of poor health and depressive, and was of bad temper. And she beat him as regularly as the flow of her cycle.
<name>Stephen's</name>	Stephen's	Misra	I couldn’t come home straight, I didn’t want to infect you with the sickness which had come upon me. I was telling the story of my disgust and despair, the story above all of [MASK]’s death, when the eclipse happened.
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Hilaal	Do the dead dream? Told about the burial and the funeral, he asked, “Why did you not shake me out of my fever?” [MASK] said, “We were worried.” “Worried?”
<name>Churchill</name>	Churchill	Misra	You accepted it with a great reverence that befits the memory of the old man you loved, and the British political figure for whom the old man held high admiration. “Do you know who this man is? ” said [MASK], pointing a finger at the portrait.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Misra	“This is a pen.” “This is a nib.” “That is a book.” Power! Once, long ago, I said to myself, [MASK] was my cosmos. She was good, she was kind, she was motherly
<name>Ali</name>	Ali	Aria	Who will you kill, your enemy or yourself? And what's wrong with eating well and not being a refugee, which you might have been if you weren't my sister, [MASK]'s, son and ifSalaado and I weren't doing well financially.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Askar	“I agree with you,” he said. They were silent for a few minutes. “So what do we do?” she said. His eyes lit with mischief. He pretended to be thinking. “What?” she asked. “What is it, [MASK]?”
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Misra	[MASK] told me, again and again, the details of the day and hour she had found me. And I know what she was wearing that day and with whom she had been. She came into the room I had been in, she elegant-looking and I an ugly mess and nearly dead.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Misra	all I hope to be able to do — knock on your doors of sleep, enter into bed and be with you until your eyes open and the door of sleep is shut. [MASK] said, “All that one hopes to remain of one is a memory dwelling in someone’s head.
<name>immortal</name>	immortal	Dhegdheer	In a couple of these, there were even humaneating types — with [MASK] dying not and the heavens raining not! On occasion, she would give, in outline, the moral of the tale before she narrated it to you, and at times she would let you retell it
<name>Ohad</name>	Ohad	Kierkegaard	He was very sad. For her. INTERLUDE Life can only be lived forward and understood backward. [MASK] The joy of travel, you said to yourself, there is nothing like it. The joy of open spaces, that’s divinity itself.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Shahrawello	Anyway, [MASK] is reported to have said that a man is not his clothes but that “a child inherits its mother’s hates and loves”. And she bet her life, if anyone was willing to bet a coin of the smallest denomination, that the young one wouldn’t like his uncle.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hilaal	Then she wouldn’t drop tears as big as French onions, sniffing, onion-eyed and complaining, “Oh, what must I do now?” [MASK] gave her a napkin with which to wipe away the tears.
<name>myself</name>	myself	Salaado	In view of this, for example, we decided, [MASK] and I, that is, as though we believed we had your consent too — we decided, we would not raise these burning questions or ask for an investigation team to be appointed and a case opened — no.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Misra	When the warrior arrived back in his hamlet, [MASK] went on telling you her story, his people intimated to him that they were afraid the girl might be traced to them — the soldiers of the Empire would follow the civilian invaders and the punitive expeditions would find many unburied dead.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Askar	When questioned, each denied he was present when this occurred. But they all mentioned [MASK]’s name. Not that he had done it, no. It was possible, they insinuated, that he might know who had been responsible. They could not go unpunished.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Misra	In one sense, you considered yourself a solitary child and spent a great deal of your time alone. Unless you were with [MASK], you found all other company “demanding, boring, in short, lifeless”.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Askar	And he was shouting and screaming and kicking against the ribs of the woman who had caged him inside of her. And it was then that he heard the voice of yet another woman call him by name, a woman who was saying, “[MASK], wake up.
<name>Tereza</name>	Tereza	Karin	A couple of other women beat [MASK] on the chest as though she were a tin drum, they beat her on the back of the neck like one who’s choked on a large piece of meat but won’t vomit it out voluntarily.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Shahrawello	But he had a question. “Why three? How does the figure three enter the picture? Why not six hundred and four or eight or nine?” Again, there was no hesitation in her voice. “[MASK]’s three sons, massacred later.”
<name>she</name>	she	Misra	I wondered if it was pain in his back causing strain on his nerves. I suggested he sit on a proper chair. He did. I? I felt weak — almost as weak as [MASK] when she aborted. I remembered her lying in bed for days.
<name>Farah</name>	Farah	Askar	I said, and waited anxiously because I knew I had laboured the point. “If her Somali is as good as yours, then I doubt if any bureaucratic clown would dare stand in her way or dare deny her what is hers by right. Remember this, [MASK].
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Misra	I asked [MASK], “A war? And whom are we fighting?” In those days, everything and everybody was throbbing with inexplicable activity in so far as I was concerned and a number of people were said to be getting ready to marry.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Misra	I admit the abrupt removal from [MASK]’s reassuring presence was similar to being weaned — despite the fact that I don’t know what “weaning” means (I was bottle-fed or “cup-fed”).
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Misra	And I cried a furious cry, so heinous that he froze where he was, frightened at the thought that I might harm myself. When he came nearer me, I cried louder and with vengeance and no one could silence me until [MASK] returned.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Salaado	We’re a family. The three of us.” That night, they talked it over and decided they would tell you their story, in the honesty and open-heartedness with which you had narrated yours. “It is only fair,” said [MASK].
<name>she</name>	she	Misra	She was good, she was kind, she was motherly and I loved her warmly, I cared about her tenderly. Now that cosmos has been made to disintegrate, and [MASK] has betrayed. What am I to do? I, who still love her!
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Misra	Taking it, you felt something move and the tin-foil in which [MASK] had wrapped it glittered in your eyes. But what was it? It was food which was still warm. How did she know you felt empty? You began eating voraciously and you guzzled and guzzled.
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Misra	And in the miraged distance, prominent as an oasis, there was a colt, riderless — but saddled. You sighed — relieved. You knew [MASK] was back, you knew she hadn’t, as yet, placed a curse on your head.
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Askar	As they retook their respective seats, [MASK] said, “Tell me how her body was mutilated? Tell me all. What was missing? Why? Tell me all. Tell me everything you know.” They consulted discreetly.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Salaado	“We talked a little,” volunteered [MASK]. “Naturally, about you.” “Yes?” “She said, for instance, that she finds something elegant, something ... er ... how did she put it ...
<name>your mother</name>	your mother	Hilaal	And if the two of you met in broad daylight, in the presence of other people, when, say, [MASK] was here, or one of your friends, one of your acquaintances or one of your neighbours?
<name>human</name>	human	Misra	Sex between men (who are, in all traditional, i.e. male-dominated, societies, placed higher than women) and women is okay. Sex between [MASK] and her rapists, who themselves assumed the identity of baboons — is this sex between higher and lower animals?”
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Misra	[MASK] was not there. I was alone. And no one told me where I was, no one told me who I was. §VI By the time I started to limp my way to places (although there was a slight pain between my legs)
<name>you</name>	you	Askar	As he put down things on the table-mats, he said to [MASK], “We cannot understand how you can be so insensitive, so unkind to the woman who had been once a mother to you.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Askar	You can wash, you can sleep, you can do what you please,” and, having said that, he walked away and vanished through the corridor, back into his study. Half a second later, his head emerged and he was saying, “Welcome, [MASK].
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Salaado	I’m afraid I couldn’t remember the text of the Faatixa, let alone any other verse of the Koran. I put this down to my mental state — but I wouldn’t be able to remember any even now. Can you believe it? I, [MASK], prayed, together with everyone else.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Salaado	$V When [MASK] returned, I was in my room, busy drawing (how did she put it) space-in-space-out-of-space, but was, at that point in time, in a mood to be interrupted — which she did.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Askar	The man went on, “And I have a message. Would you like to receive it? And will you promise to deliver it to its rightful recipient, my son?” [MASK] nodded his head, but didn’t ask who the rightful recipient of the message was.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Hilaal	“We suspect there may have been foul play of a wicked kind,” said she, her voice shaken, like someone regretting he had said more than he intended. A pause. She turned to [MASK]. It was obvious she was seeking his assistance.
