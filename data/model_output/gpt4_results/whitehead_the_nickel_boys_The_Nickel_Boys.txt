<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Turner	No woods beyond them as far as he saw. The pasture was closer, surrounded by a white wooden fence. [MASK] shouted to his partner. They were going to have to run. They steered to the bumpy side of the road and leapt off the bikes.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Elwood	Every year [MASK] concocted new inflections and gestures, the speeches losing their stiffness as his own convictions enlivened the portrait. “It is my pleasure to inform you fine gentlemen and ladies that the time has come to throw off the yoke of slavery and take our places as true Americans—at long last!”
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Elwood	[MASK] didn’t want to chuckle, like it would be cheating on his pain, but he couldn’t help it. His testicles were swole up from where the strap landed between his legs, and his laughter tugged something inside and made them hurt again.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Lou	“There was this old head who worked in the kitchen, his name was [MASK]. One of those dudes you know have seen some shit. He didn’t talk much to us pin boys, he flipped burgers. Because he wasn’t too friendly, we didn’t conversate much.
<name>Rudy</name>	Rudy	Elwood	Knowing that he’d gone down, the other boys no longer kept him at a distance. He was one of them now. [MASK] got sick of looking at his new pants sitting there on the chair. He folded them up and stuffed them under his mattress.
<name>She</name>	She	Harriet	They shook hands in a manly fashion. [MASK] wished him good luck. She checked his school outfit every morning to make sure he was presentable, but apart from plucking the occasional piece of lint never made any corrections. This day was no different.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Elwood	Tell the sheriff who he was, share [MASK]’s story and what they did to him when he tried to put a stop to their crimes. Tell the White House boys that he was one of them, and he survived, like them.
<name>James</name>	James	Turner	He had to work, but they were out protesting. And it happened—they opened the counter. [MASK] didn’t have the money to eat there either way. You can change the law but you can’t change people and how they treat each other.
<name>James</name>	James	Elwood	[MASK] went through the books one by one during school hours while the boys around him stuttered and stumbled. He had intended to study British literature at the college. Now he had to teach himself. It would have to do.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Clayton	He didn’t care where his ride was headed as long as it took him a couple of hours’ distance. [MASK] was starving. He’d never gone this long without eating and didn’t know how to remedy that, but miles were the most important thing.
<name>Maxfield</name>	Maxfield	Nickel	The supervisor closed the big sliding door to the warehouse, bolted it, and they climbed into the front seat of a gray van. Unlike the other school vehicles, it didn’t have [MASK]’s name painted on it.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Elwood	“What’s in these things?” “I’ve been writing everything down,” [MASK] said. “Everything what?” “The deliveries. The yard work and chores. The names of everybody and the dates. All our Community Service.”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Elwood	“Sometimes they take you to the White House and we never see your ass again.” It was quiet on the ward except for them and the buzz saw next door, keening. [MASK] didn’t want to know but he asked anyway.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Desmond	The Holiday Luncheon was marked on the big calendar in the dorm’s entrance hall. [MASK] said it wasn’t for them, it was for the staff. A nice meal in the dining hall to celebrate another year of hard work on the north campus.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Elwood	The worst thing that ever happened to [MASK] happened every day: He woke in that room. He would never tell anyone about those days of darkness. Who would come for him? He had never considered himself an orphan.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chickie	“I don’t want to ask,” [MASK] said. Here it comes. “But if you’re looking for a hand, I could use the job. I’m sleeping on a couch.” “Right.” “You have a card?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Elwood	There was a new pair of denim pants on the chair next to [MASK]’s hospital bed. The beating had embedded bits of the first into his skin and it took two hours for the doctor to remove the fibers. It was a duty the doctor had to perform from time to time.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Marconi	When the boys he used to play cowboys and Indians with chased him down the street every once in a while or threw rocks at him, it was less out of mischief than resentment. People from his block stopped in [MASK]’s all the time, and his worlds overlapped.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Spencer	He was scared of a place that was run by men like [MASK] and what that meant for his time there—to be under the eyes of men who liked to make threats and relished the effect of their threats on people—but perhaps the black staff looked after their own.
<name>Iron</name>	Iron	Rusty	Most of those who know the story of the rings in the trees are dead by now. The iron is still there. [MASK]. Deep in the heartwood. Testifying to anyone who cares to listen. M iscreants had bashed in the reindeers’ heads.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elwood	The longer wall had one big window with three smaller ones next to it like ducklings. A patch of uncut grass, a foot wide, encircled the build- ing, untouched and untamed. “Should we cut that, too?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bill	In his head he’d seen kids attached to balls and chains, something out of cartoons, but these fellows were having a swell time out there, thundering around the grass. “All right,” [MASK] said, pleased.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Elwood	“You’ll be picking potatoes sooner or later, don’t worry,” he told [MASK]. Gangs of students walked the trails and roads to their work assignments while supervisors in their state cars crisscrossed the property, watching.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Turner	The bikes were still where they’d left them, next to the gardening tools. The moonlight was enough to make them out. [MASK] pumped up the tires. He didn’t have to search for the pump. How long had he been planning this?
<name>Earth</name>	Earth	Nickel	They had managed to scrape up a life after leaving [MASK] or had never fit in at all with normal people. The last smokers of cigarette brands you never see, late to the self-help regimens, always on the verge of disappearing.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Hardee	The White House got a new coat. No one saw who did it. One day it was its dingy self, the next it made the sun vibrate on eyeballs. Judging from [MASK]’s face as he toured the progress, the boys were on track for a good showing.
<name>Rocco</name>	Rocco	Griff	“My first fight made me cockeyed,” he said, “and my farewell fight set my eyes right again, so trust me when I say this sport will break you down to make you better, and that’s a fact.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Harriet	From what he read in Nickel articles the last few years, they buried dead boys quick to head off any investigation, not even a word to their families—but then who had the money to bring them home and rebury them? Not [MASK].
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Turner	[MASK] sighed. He had to admit that the game had gotten boring. It was nice for a time to picture one of their tormentors puking all over their yummy spread at the Holiday Luncheon, spraying all those peckerwoods with his mess.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Elwood	After a week, things in the house were back to their routine, but [MASK] was changed. Closer. At the demonstration, he had felt somehow closer to himself. For a moment. Out there in the sun. It was enough to feed his dreams.
<name>She</name>	She	Millie	She usually got home in time for the eleven o’clock news. He’d canceled date night twice already—date night was some women’s magazine thing now embedded in his vocabulary like a splinter—so [MASK] was not going to let him miss this one.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Turner	“How come?” [MASK] finished his juice with a slurp. “Sometimes they take you to the White House and we never see your ass again.” It was quiet on the ward except for them and the buzz saw next door, keening.
<name>the church</name>	the church	Turner	The last Saturday of every month she wore her good red dress and sprayed perfume into her neck and went out with her girlfriends, but apart from that her life was the hospital, where she worked as a nurse, and [MASK]. No one had ever called her pretty.
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Hardee	He was a short man, fastened into his suits, with a bald pate that floated in a cloud bank of white hair. [MASK] had brought his wife, a robust beauty whose every visit was thoroughly annotated by the students, if furtively—reckless eyeballing called for mandatory beatings.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Elwood	He turned the shop into a showcase for avuncular enthusiasm. The long silences gave way to lessons from his immigrant struggles and eccentric business advice. He took to closing the shop an hour early to visit his granddaughter and paid [MASK] for a full shift.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Turner	“You got to let them think they know what’s going on,” he told [MASK] one day. “They see it with their own eyes, distract themselves with that, so they can’t see the bigger game.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chickie	He liked to pump iron, his T-shirt sleeves as tight as a rubber on his biceps. The kind of gorilla you hire for Saturday nights if you get a crowd. He put down a twenty even though [MASK] said drinks were on him.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Elwood	Thanksgiving turkeys and Christmas hams disappeared into the hands of fry cooks, and the assistant principal of the elementary school opened a box of erasers and counted them one by one. [MASK] wondered why the boys had no toothpaste—now he knew.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Turner	[MASK] liked to hover and take in the show. Track the hustler’s eyes, track the mark’s eyes as he tried to follow the queen of hearts. Then they turned over their card: How their faces collapsed when they saw they weren’t as smart as they thought.
<name>Chili's</name>	Chili's	Ace	After he got [MASK] up and running, he sometimes took his employees out and brought them here, until he learned that if he drank with the guys they took liberties. Show up late or no-show with lame excuses. Or scruffy, their uniforms rumpled.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Chickie	Ten-year lease. The longest thing he’d ever committed to, and it was weird because the only thing that bothered him about it was that he wasn’t bothered about it. “My man,” [MASK] said. “Moving on up!
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Turner	He was slow with his steps. He didn’t want to know if [MASK] had been intercepted, or if the boy had ratted on him or simply taken his letter up to his hideout and put a match to it.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Elwood	She let [MASK] work at the store after school and on weekends, taking half his paycheck at the end of the week for the household and half for college. He’d mentioned going to college the summer prior, casually, with no inkling of the momentousness of his words.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Phil	Another boy, a chuck, opened the bathroom door and yelled, “Oh, shit.” [MASK], one of the white housemen, was making the rounds. He had a drowsy way about him and usually pretended not to see what was right in front of his face.
<name>limbo</name>	limbo	Nickel	Like, money changed hands. But if there had been bribe money, the boy wouldn’t have been cast into [MASK] in the first place. Still, the law was corrupt and capricious in various measure and sometimes a boy strolled out through what passed for divine intervention.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Elwood	His voice made the chucks jump when he crept up on them, and he got a kick out of it, until one day a supervisor with an even deeper voice crept up on him and taught him a lesson. [MASK] told him his name again, to signal a new start to their acquaintance.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Elwood	[MASK] assumed he meant the housemen; there were eight of them spread out at different tables in the mess, eating with their charges. It was impossible he’d overheard, but the houseman closest to them looked up and sent everybody act-casual.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Nickel	Stealing a car was a big-ticket offense for [MASK]. He’d learn that most of the kids had been sent here for much lesser—and nebulous and inexplicable—offenses. Some students were wards of the state, without family, and there was nowhere else to put them.
<name>Argus</name>	Argus	Spencer	I’ll see to it personally.” [MASK] had a severe face, but when he touched the enormous key ring on his belt the corners of his mouth twitched in pleasure, it seemed, or to signal a murkier emotion.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Elwood	They walked quickly past the bank. It seemed like a place where board members might appear, or at least white men with power who signed official documents, like reform school orders. “It’s weird being out here,” [MASK] said.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Grandma	He’d never touched her like that before, as if reassuring a child. “[MASK], what is it?” Most visitors wept on visiting day at some point, at the sight of the Nickel turnoff coming up the road, on departure, with their backs to their sons.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Hardee	Things were quieting down at the statehouse, [MASK] was less distressed. The worst was over. The government had too much power to interfere, was the problem in general. Way he saw it. It got worse every year.
<name>Maloney</name>	Maloney	Smith	Neighborhood folks recognized them immediately from their hawkish profiles, light brown eyes, the flittering way they moved their hands and mouths when they talked. The similarities persisted beneath the skin, for [MASK] men were neither lucky nor long-lived.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Elwood	Students argued over who was next for table tennis, slapped paddles toward the saggy net, and cursed over wild shots, the pop of the white balls like the ragged heartbeat of an adolescent afternoon. [MASK] checked out the meager offerings on the bookshelves, the Hardy Boys and comic books.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Bell	[MASK] would devise secret signals and places to meet that only she knew about. She was smart that way. It’d be a long time before she tucked him in again and told him the things that made it all fine, but he could wait it out if she was close.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Turner	That’ll have to be enough.” He cleared his throat and said, “You come along, now,” as if herding a lamb who’d wandered. [MASK] was alone again. “Ain’t that some shit?” he said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Elwood	“Not like what you got,” he said. “Not that bad. I’ve never gone down. I got smacked across the face for smoking once.” “I have a lawyer,” [MASK] said. “He can do something.”
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Turner	There were two oaks on one side of the stables, with iron rings stabbed into the bark. “This is out back," [MASK] said. “They say once in a while they take a black boy here and shackle him up to those.
<name>tomorrow</name>	tomorrow	Nickel	The tears came at night, when he imagined what [MASK] held in store for him. When he heard his grandmother sobbing in her room next door, fussing around, opening and closing things because she didn’t know what to do with her hands.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Elwood	It was only [MASK] on the ward then. The curtain that had been around the nameless boy was in the corner, folded flat into itself. The bed was empty. He’d disappeared sometime in the night without waking anyone.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Desmond	and the boy made an effort to fulfill the house father’s orders from the night before. [MASK] had a round head, chubby baby cheeks, and a voice that startled everyone the first time they heard it, it was so gruff and full of bass.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Rodney	The white deputy parked a few yards behind them. He put his left hand on his holster and walked up. He took off his sunglasses and put them in his chest pocket. [MASK] said, “You don’t know me, do you?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Turner	It was not the hideout of a canny operator but the slim refuge of a runaway who had stepped into a doorway to get out of the rain, collar hugged tight. [MASK] sat against a box of machine oil and cradled his knees. “I did it,” he said.
<name>He</name>	He	Elwood	He asked himself later if he heard [MASK] cry out or make any kind of sound but never did figure it out. He was running and there was only the rush and roil of blood in his head. Those kiosks didn’t like him, no matter how much he jabbed and muttered at the screens.
<name>Granger</name>	Granger	Blakeley	“You boys are in charge of everything,” [MASK] said. “Burn the bricks in all these buildings you see here, lay the concrete, take care of all this grass. Do a good job, too, as you can see.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Harper	“They wouldn’t do that,” [MASK] said. This was his childhood he was talking about. He grew up on those matches, chomping popped corn in the VIP section. “It’s a beautiful thing.”
<name>Grady</name>	Grady	Turner	“They’re playing poker down at the motor pool tonight,” [MASK] said. “We’ll see.” Once they got out of the light cast from the windows, they made a hobbled sprint for the main road. They were out.
<name>Melissa</name>	Melissa	Yvette	It was cheaper but was he getting ripped off in the long run with the co-pay bullshit? This species of paperwork had always confounded and vexed. He’d have [MASK] explain it again when she got in the next day.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Blakeley	Every day he wore the same buffalo belt buckle, nestled above his crotch and under his potbelly like an animal wending between hills. [MASK] gave the boys the schedule of the inspection. He was alert and awake, having forsworn his nightcaps.
<name>He</name>	He	Elwood	On the map it looked less populated and the same, distance-wise. He was sure the drivers were checking them out. Looking straight ahead was best. [MASK] kept pace, to his surprise. Around the curve, the road lifted to a slope.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Elwood	The oatmeal had a bunch of cinnamon dumped into it to hide a lousy taste. [MASK] gobbled it down. He finished peeling his orange before he finally looked up at the boy across the table who had been staring at him.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lord	The bed she died in, stripped to the blue-and-white striped mattress and her stains. “Are we taking the mattress?” “We are not taking the mattress.” [MASK] knows he had a fear in those days of dying like that.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Elwood	He jumped over the fence on the other side of the pasture and into the woods and then both boys were gone. In [MASK]’s name, he tried to find another way. Now here he was. Where had it taken him?
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Elwood	Didn’t even look up from his racing form. [MASK] dressed in the dark slacks from last year’s Emancipation Day play. He’d grown a few inches, so he let them out and they showed the barest sliver of his white socks.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Elwood	They drove up the long road to the main administration building and [MASK] caught sight of a football field where some boys scrimmaged and yelped. In his head he’d seen kids attached to balls and chains, something out of cartoons, but these fellows were having a swell time out there, thundering around the grass.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Elwood	The room was empty when they shoved [MASK] in. The next afternoon a houseman on the day shift gave the boy a bucket for a toilet, but no more. Light strained through the mesh opening at the top of the door, a gray light his eyes eventually became accustomed to.
<name>Elmview</name>	Elmview	Nickel	They’d find a way out of this mess of thorns, she told her grandson, and promised to visit his first Sunday at [MASK]. But when she showed up, they told her that he was sick and couldn’t have visitors. She asked what was wrong with him.
<name>Worm</name>	Worm	Sturdy	[MASK] was the word he returned to, even though the Tallahassee boy looked soft, conducted himself like a goody-goody, and had an irritating tendency to preach. Wore eyeglasses you wanted to grind underfoot like a butterfly.
<name>Negroes</name>	Negroes	Negroes	Not many cars passed and the white faces scared him, even if he was bold enough to take to the asphalt. There were no Negro drivers; maybe [MASK] didn’t own cars in this part of the state.
<name>Slater</name>	Slater	Nickel	Free to return home or to make their way in the indifferent world, likely shunted down one of life’s more difficult trails. Boys arrived banged up in different ways before they got to [MASK] and picked up more dents and damage during their term.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Percy	[MASK] had been too big for the town since he got back from the war. He served in the Pacific theater, behind the lines keeping up the supply chain. He came back evil. Not because of what happened overseas but from what he saw on his return.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nickel	Words the boys didn’t understand either, but what was the point when their meaning was clear enough: [MASK]. I got bustedfor sleeping in a garage to keep warm, I stole jive dollars from my teacher\ I drank a bottle of cough syrup and went wild one night.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Elwood	[MASK] took to reconnoitering spent or rotten planks. Tiny gray bugs boiled forth and slinked from the daylight. He’d gotten into a nice rhythm when the signal went up—the inspectors had departed the gymnasium and were headed toward the football field.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Clayton	She was smart that way. It’d be a long time before she tucked him in again and told him the things that made it all fine, but he could wait it out if she was close. “Hush now, [MASK] ...”
<name>insomnia</name>	insomnia	Spencer	Then he was up for hours, in a spell, agitated by rickety thoughts and weakened by an ebbing of the spirit. It wasn’t [MASK] that undid him, or a supervisor or a new antagonist slumbering in room 2, rather it was that he’d stopped fighting.
<name>John</name>	John	Blakeley	I’m sure you can come to an arrangement.” He smiled. “You ever worked a field?” he asked. They grew multiple crops on the 1,400 acres—limes, sweet potatoes, watermelon. “I came up on a farm,” [MASK] said.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	JFK	Ran up to the man’s car and said, ‘I thought you’d like a copy.’ ” “Which one did you give it to?” “[MASK], who else?” In disdain. “You think I gave it to that dude from The Honeymooners?”
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Harper	" On campus they had to go by the rules. “Sir, I’d rather work on the bleachers.” [MASK] frowned. “Acting crazy today, all of you. You do what I asked you and on Friday it’s back to the usual.”
<name>Callum</name>	Callum	Turner	“You say that because there’s no one else out there sticking up for you.” “That’s true,” [MASK] said. “That doesn’t mean I can’t see how it works. Maybe I see things more clearly because of it.”
<name>Harrison</name>	Harrison	Nickel	[MASK] was a longtime boxing evangelist, had steered a lobbying group for its expansion in the Olympics. Boxing had always been popular at the school, as most of the boys had seen their share of scrapes, but the new director took the sport’s elevation as his remit.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Nickel	There was no higher system guiding [MASK]’s brutality, merely an indiscriminate spite, one that had nothing to do with people. A figment from tenth-grade science struck him: a Perpetual Misery Machine, one that operated by itself without human agency.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Elwood	No one talked to [MASK] at dinner, as if what was coming was catching. Some boys whispered when he passed— What a dummy—and the bullies gave him angry looks, but mostly there was a heavy pressure of menace and unease in the dormitory that didn’t end until they took the boys away.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Elwood	“It’s not like the old days,” [MASK] said. “We can stand up for ourselves.” “That shit barely works out there—what do you think it’s going to do in here?”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Denise	Hobbled and handicapped before the race even began, never figuring out how to be normal. The tablecloths were new since the last time he was here—red-and-white checkered vinyl. [MASK] used to complain about the sticky tables, in those days.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Desmond	Spiderwebs canopied one corner and [MASK] stabbed a broom at the white blossoms, wary of what might burst forth. He recognized some of the loose cans stacked there and found a place for them, but there was one green relic too faded to read.
<name>Elwood</name>	Elwood	Corey	and sent him crashing down the stairs, they ignored him. [MASK], the boy he’d stepped up to defend, winked at him once. Everyone had moved on to girding themselves for the next Nickel mishap, the one that was out of their hands.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Desmond	He canvassed but didn’t get a clear picture of how to graduate early. [MASK], that scientist of demerit and credit, was no help. “You get merits for behavior every week if you do what you’re supposed to do, right off the bat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Griff	They had never seen [MASK] cry before and took his tears for those of triumph. Getting hit in the head can rattle your brains. Getting hit in the head like that can make you addle-minded and confused.
<name>Mosquitoes</name>	Mosquitoes	Bugs	When he couldn’t take another step he hid under a lonesome gray house and squatted in the fetid water of the crawl space. [MASK] made supper of him and he caressed the bumps on his skin to see how much he could soothe them without scratching open the bites.
<name>Enders</name>	Enders	Elwood	[MASK] tilted his head to listen for noise from the house father’s quarters. The couch was near the door. Many a boy had made the journey up the steps to rouse him from that couch when he slept through reveille.
