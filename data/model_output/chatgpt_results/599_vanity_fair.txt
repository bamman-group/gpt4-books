<name>Madame Merle</name>	Madame Merle	Amelia	Perhaps the doctor's lady had good reason for her jealousy: most women shared it, of those who formed the small circle of [MASK]'s acquaintance, and were quite angry at the enthusiasm with which the other sex regarded her.
<name>Stranger</name>	Stranger	Emmy	Let me go, [MASK]. It is only to suppose that I have not met you, and I am no worse to-day than I was yesterday. It is only to suppose that the night is over and the poor wanderer is on her way.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Amelia	Indeed, [MASK] dressed in her wedding-pelisse and pink ribbons, with a flush in her face, occasioned by rapid travel through the open air, looked so fresh and pretty, as fully to justify the Ensign's compliment.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Amelia	The old lady grudged her even those rare visits; she, who had been a kind, smiling, good-natured mother once, in the days of her prosperity, but whom poverty and infirmities had broken down. Her illness or estrangement did not affect [MASK].
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Rebecca	[MASK] is a droll funny creature, to be sure; and those descriptions of the poor lady weeping for the loss of her beauty, and the gentleman "with hay-coloured whiskers and straw-coloured hair," are very smart, doubtless, and show a great knowledge of the world.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	George	Then he lapsed into silence, and swallowed sundry glasses of wine, looking more and more terrible, till a brisk knock at the door told of [MASK]'s arrival when everybody began to rally. "He could not come before.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	George	A day came--of almost terrified delight and wonder--when the poor widowed girl pressed a child upon her breast--a child, with the eyes of [MASK] who was gone--a little boy, as beautiful as a cherub. What a miracle it was to hear its first cry!
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Sambo	Her jet-black hair is as curly as [MASK]'s. I dare say she wore a nose ring when she went to court; and with a plume of feathers in her top-knot she would look a perfect Belle Sauvage."
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Kirsch	Put out my uniform, [MASK]--both our uniforms. It is a mark of politeness which every English gentleman ought to show to the countries which he visits to pay his respects to the sovereigns of those countries as to the representatives of his own."
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	John	"Ees," says the man at the door, with a nod. "Hand down these 'ere trunks then," said [MASK]. "Hand 'n down yourself," said the porter. "Don't you see I can't leave my hosses?
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Georgy	It is so pleasant and cool. She can look up and see the drawing-room windows illuminated, and, at about nine o'clock, the chamber in the upper story where [MASK] sleeps. She knows--he has told her.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Amelia	"Indeed, [MASK], no," the other said, still hanging down her head. "When you were quite poor, who was it that befriended you? Was I not a sister to you? You saw us all in happier days before he married me.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Tinker	Now the dowager's dead I want some one." "She was as bad as he," said [MASK]. "She took the law of every one of her tradesmen; and turned away forty-eight footmen in four year."
<name>unknown</name>	unknown	Rawdon	One man was present whom [MASK] did not know; another to whom he owed a little score for whist, and whom, in consequence, he did not care to meet; a third was reading the Royalist (a periodical famous for its scandal and its attachment to Church and King)
<name>Nell</name>	Nell	Pitt	Ain't there no one at the King's Head to rub 'em a little? How do, [MASK]? How do, my dear? Come to see the old man, hay? 'Gad--you've a pretty face, too.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	George	Here she sate, and recalled to herself fondly that image of [MASK] to which she had knelt before marriage. Did she own to herself how different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	George	Many timid remonstrances had she uttered to [MASK] in behalf of her brother, but the former in his trenchant way cut these entreaties short. "I'm an honest man," he said, "and if I have a feeling I show it, as an honest man will.
<name>Mrs. Gamp</name>	Mrs. Gamp	Emmy	[MASK] laughed: she called him a naughty man, who wanted to run away in debt, and, in fact, made some jokes suitable to the occasion and the small-beer. She was in high spirits and good humour, and tripped across the market-place very briskly.
<name>Major</name>	Major	Dob	said he, "there's [MASK]'s trap--they are bringing it out of the court-yard." The "trap" in question was a carriage which the Major had bought for six pounds sterling, and about which they used to rally him a good deal.
<name>David</name>	David	George	Amidst such humble scenes and associates [MASK]'s early youth was passed, and the boy grew up delicate, sensitive, imperious, woman-bred--domineering the gentle mother whom he loved with passionate affection. He ruled all the rest of the little world round about him.
<name>George</name>	George	George	I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved you from the first minute that I saw you, when [MASK] brought me to your house, to show me the Amelia whom he was engaged to.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Rodgers	There is no help for it; the faithful proselytizer, if she cannot convince by argument, bursts into tears, and the refusant finds himself, at the end of the contest, taking down the bolus, and saying, "Well, well, [MASK]' be it."
<name>her brother</name>	her brother	George	Her father had met with fresh misfortunes which had entirely ruined him. Her own pittance was so small that it would barely enable her to support her parents and would not suffice to give [MASK] the advantages which were his due.
<name>John</name>	John	Jos	I've just got her to lie down." "Get her up," said [MASK]; "she must get up, I say": and he stamped his foot energetically. "I say the horses are ordered--yes, the horses are ordered.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Glorvina	[MASK] danced past him in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station, and the Major was not in the least jealous of her performance, or angry because Captain Bangles of the Cavalry handed her to supper.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Amelia	To do them justice, neither of the sisters was very much displeased. There is something about a runaway match with which few ladies can be seriously angry, and [MASK] rather rose in their estimation, from the spirit which she had displayed in consenting to the union.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Amelia	In this room was all [MASK]'s heart and treasure. Here it was that she tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with a constant passion of love. The elder George returned in him somehow, only improved, and as if come back from heaven.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Jos	"I should have known you anywhere," she continued; "a woman never forgets some things. And you were the first man I ever--I ever saw." "Was I really?" said [MASK]. "God bless my soul, you--you don't say so."
<name>Manon</name>	Manon	Rawdon	Numbers of the men she knew already, and the dandies thronged round her. As for the ladies, it was whispered among them that [MASK] had run away with her from out of a convent, and that she was a relation of the Montmorency family.
<name>George</name>	George	Jos	He was riding on an elephant away from some cocoa-nut trees and a pagoda: it was an Eastern scene. "God bless my soul, it is my portrait," [MASK] cried out. It was he indeed, blooming in youth and beauty, in a nankeen jacket of the cut of 1804.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Emmy	[MASK] said. "I'm sure I can't tell what he meant." His presence and that of his friend inspired the little lady with intolerable terror and aversion. They paid her tipsy compliments; they leered at her over the dinner-table.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Becky	Forced to fly her husband's roof by this insult, the coward had pursued his revenge by taking her child from her. And thus [MASK] said she was a wanderer, poor, unprotected, friendless, and wretched.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pitt	"Why, hang it, [MASK]!" said the father to his remonstrance. "You wouldn't be such a flat as to let three thousand a year go out of the family?" "What is money compared to our souls, sir?"
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Peggy	"I'd like ye wake me about half an hour before the assembly beats," the Major said to his lady. "Call me at half-past one, [MASK] dear, and see me things is ready.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Amelia	She seized the baby out of her mother's arms and then grasped at the bottle, leaving the old lady gaping at her, furious, and holding the guilty tea-spoon. [MASK] flung the bottle crashing into the fire-place.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Bowls	This delicacy made his aunt laugh the more. "Go and settle the bill, [MASK]," she said, with a wave of her hand, "and bring it to me." Poor lady, she did not know what she had done!
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Osborne	Here, according to custom, [MASK] had recorded on the fly-leaf, and in his large clerk-like hand, the dates of his marriage and his wife's death, and the births and Christian names of his children.
<name>heroine</name>	heroine	Amelia	So, indeed, were even friendship and kindness. She received them both uncomplainingly, and having accepted them, relapsed into her grief. Suppose some twelve months after the above conversation took place to have passed in the life of our poor [MASK].
<name>Washington</name>	Washington	Jos	This speech might be interpreted, "My dear sir, should an accident befall the army, and a retreat be necessary, you have a very comfortable carriage, in which I propose to take a seat." I don't know whether [MASK] understood the words in this sense.
<name>the cat</name>	the cat	Rebecca	He gasped out at various intervals these exclamations of rage and grief. The cook looked at the housemaid, the housemaid looked knowingly at the footman--the awful kitchen inquisition which sits in judgement in every house and knows everything--sat on [MASK] at that moment.
<name>Lockwood</name>	Lockwood	Pitt	Ha, ha! Some of it will do to patch up the Hall when I'm gone." "I perceive, sir," said [MASK] with a heightened voice, "that your people will cut down the timber.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Rebecca	The happiness--the superior advantages of the young women round about her, gave [MASK] inexpressible pangs of envy. "What airs that girl gives herself, because she is an Earl's grand-daughter," she said of one.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Emmy	She carries laudanum with her--I saw the bottle in her room--such a miserable little room--at a third-rate house, the Elephant, up in the roof at the top of all. I went there." This did not seem to affect [MASK].
<name>Bonaparte</name>	Bonaparte	Rebecca	and would that odious [MASK] once more get into favour? The Rector's wife wrote a sermon for her husband about the vanity of military glory and the prosperity of the wicked, which the worthy parson read in his best voice and without understanding one syllable of it.
<name>Mr. Knightley</name>	Mr. Knightley	Amelia	She was so agitated at the drawing-room door, that she could hardly find courage to enter. "Feel my heart, how it beats, dear!" said she to her friend. "No, it doesn't," said [MASK].
<name>Madame Merle</name>	Madame Merle	Jos	She sang, she played, she laughed, she talked in two or three languages, she brought everybody to the house, and she made [MASK] believe that it was his own great social talents and wit which gathered the society of the place round about him.
<name>pride</name>	pride	Rebecca	You may be sure that she showed [MASK] over every room of the house, and everything in every one of her drawers; and her books, and her piano, and her dresses, and all her necklaces, brooches, laces, and gimcracks.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Rawdon	"She has been whimpering half a dozen times, at the very notion of it, already to me." "YOU don't care, I suppose?" [MASK] said, half angry at his wife's want of feeling. "You wretch!
<name>Uncle Podger</name>	Uncle Podger	Jos	The windows of the room were open, and looked southward, and a dull distant sound came over the sun-lighted roofs from that direction. "What is it?" said [MASK]. "Why don't you pour, you rascal?"
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Rawdon	[MASK] was quite overcome by that kind voice and presence. He ran up to her--caught her in his arms--gasped out some inarticulate words of thanks and fairly sobbed on her shoulder. She did not know the cause of his emotion.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Galignani	In the early spring of 1816, [MASK]'s Journal contained the following announcement in an interesting corner of the paper: "On the 26th of March--the Lady of Lieutenant-Colonel Crawley, of the Life Guards Green--of a son and heir."
<name>Mr. Woodhouse</name>	Mr. Woodhouse	Joe	"I defy anybody not to be good to you, my dear," said her mother. "The curry was capital; indeed it was," said [MASK], quite gravely. "Perhaps there was NOT enough citron juice in it--no, there was NOT."
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	William	HER assault was long since over and beaten back. "Am I to understand then, that you are going--away, [MASK]?" she said. He gave a sad laugh. "I went once before," he said, "and came back after twelve years.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Rebecca	I knew he would come. I prayed so that he should." The poor girl spoke these words with a spirit and volubility which [MASK] had never before seen in her, and before which the latter was quite dumb. "
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Georgy	A hundred fears poured one over the other into the little heart, as fast as the waves on to the Dike. The boat followed the smoke into sight. [MASK] had a dandy telescope and got the vessel under view in the most skilful manner.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sedley	"How are you, [MASK]?" that young wag began, after surveying his victim. "No bones broke? There's a hackney-coachman downstairs with a black eye, and a tied-up head, vowing he'll have the law of you."
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Pitt	Here's a cheque that [MASK] left for the boy," and she took from her bag and gave her husband a paper which his brother had handed over to her, on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys.
<name>Madame Loisel</name>	Madame Loisel	Becky	And the diamonds--"Where the doose did you get the diamonds, [MASK]?" said her husband, admiring some jewels which he had never seen before and which sparkled in her ears and on her neck with brilliance and profusion.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rawdon	It won't do to let it stand over, as to-morrow's Sunday; the beds here are not very CLEAN, and there may be other things out against me--I'm glad it an't [MASK]'s Saturday for coming home.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Fipps	"Look at that infernal sly-boots of a Tapeworm," [MASK] whispered, examining his chief from the stalls. "Wherever there's a pretty woman he always twists himself in." And I wonder what were diplomatists made for but for that?
<name>Byron</name>	Byron	Jos	[MASK] bade his man saddle the horses at once. He would ride away that very night, that very hour. And he left the valet busy in getting the horses ready, and went homewards himself to prepare for his departure. It must be secret.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	George	"It does," said [MASK], with an agonised countenance. "But he can't be angry with you long," she continued. "Nobody could, I'm sure. He must forgive you, my dearest, kindest husband.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mary	And, as in all griefs there is said to be some consolation, I may mention that poor [MASK], when left at her friend's departure in a hysterical condition, was placed under the medical treatment of the young fellow from the surgery, under whose care she rallied after a short period.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Rawdon	Did these debt-difficulties affect [MASK]'s good spirits? No. Everybody in Vanity Fair must have remarked how well those live who are comfortably and thoroughly in debt: how they deny themselves nothing; how jolly and easy they are in their minds.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Rebecca	"Well, dearest, to-morrow you must be on the look-out, and go and see her, mind, whether she asks you or no," [MASK] said, trying to soothe her angry yoke-mate.
<name>Hammond</name>	Hammond	Steyne	"I hope to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs to." He had thought to himself, it would be a fine revenge to wrap a ball in the note and kill [MASK] with it. After this colloquy the brothers once more shook hands and parted.
<name>Dives</name>	Dives	Thriftless	[MASK] gives, not from a beneficent pleasure in giving, but from a lazy delight in spending. He would not deny himself one enjoyment; not his opera-stall, not his horse, not his dinner, not even the pleasure of giving Lazarus the five pounds.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Rebecca	He found his brother-in-law in a condition of pitiable infirmity--and dreadfully afraid of [MASK], though eager in his praises of her. She tended him through a series of unheard-of illnesses with a fidelity most admirable. She had been a daughter to him.
<name>Hassan</name>	Hassan	Mesrour	"Bid the slave-merchant enter," says the Turkish voluptuary with a wave of his hand. [MASK] conducts the slave-merchant into my lord's presence; he brings a veiled female with him. He removes the veil. A thrill of applause bursts through the house.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Glorvina	Everybody admired her there; everybody danced with her; but no one proposed who was worth the marrying--one or two exceedingly young subalterns sighed after her, and a beardless civilian or two, but she rejected these as beneath her pretensions--and other and younger virgins than [MASK] were married before her.
<name>Frank Churchill</name>	Frank Churchill	Sambo	The next day, however, as the two young ladies sate on the sofa, pretending to work, or to write letters, or to read novels, [MASK] came into the room with his usual engaging grin, with a packet under his arm, and a note on a tray.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Bullock	"That's more than any of your Lords will give, I'LL warrant," he said and refused to attend at the ceremony. The splendour of the gift, however, caused great satisfaction to the house of [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Dobbin	But what man in love, of us, is better informed?--or is he much happier when he sees and owns his delusion? [MASK] was under this spell. He did not bother his friends and the public much about his feelings, or indeed lose his natural rest or appetite on account of them.
<name>William</name>	William	Emmy	He certainly had very large hands and feet, which the two George Osbornes used to caricature and laugh at; and their jeers and laughter perhaps led poor little [MASK] astray as to his worth. But have we not all been misled about our heroes and changed our opinions a hundred times?
<name>Mrs. Tulliver</name>	Mrs. Tulliver	Amelia	[MASK], the gentlest and sweetest of everyday mortals, when she found this meddling with her maternal authority, thrilled and trembled all over with anger. Her cheeks, ordinarily pale, now flushed up, until they were as red as they used to be when she was a child of twelve years old.
<name>Rochester</name>	Rochester	George	Will you do as I tell you, once for all, sir, or will you not?" "Marry that mulatto woman?" [MASK] said, pulling up his shirt-collars. "I don't like the colour, sir.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Sultan	He would be generous-minded, [MASK] as he was, and raise up this kneeling Esther and make a queen of her: besides, her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her submission, and so he cheered her, and raised her up and forgave her, so to speak.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Jos	[MASK] succeeded in plunging into the coat, and came forward blushing and stuttering out excuses to his fair visitor. "How was she after the events of the morning--after the fatigues of the ball the night before?"
<name>Jarndyce</name>	Jarndyce	Alexander	My daughter might be a Colonel's lady if she liked. I might draw upon my son, the first magistrate, sir, for two thousand pounds to-morrow, and [MASK] would cash my bill, down sir, down on the counter, sir.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Amelia	And so, if you properly tyrannize over a woman, you will find a ha'p'orth of kindness act upon her and bring tears into her eyes, as though you were an angel benefiting her. Some such boons as these were the best which Fortune allotted to poor little [MASK].
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Emmy	[MASK], in this happy time, found that hers underwent a very great change in respect of the merits of the Major. Perhaps it was the happiest time of both their lives, indeed, if they did but know it--and who does?
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Amelia	but when she is so miserable? Now is the time to be of service to her. The oldest friend I ever had, and not--" "She was not always your friend, [MASK]," the Major said, for he was quite angry.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Amelia	He could see them as he walked from home that night (to the Old Slaughters', where he put up when in town) shining white in the moon. That comfortable home was shut, then, upon [MASK] and her parents: where had they taken refuge?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Isidor	All the champagne he drank brought no courage to him. Before sunset he was worked up to such a pitch of nervousness as gratified his friend [MASK] to behold, who now counted surely upon the spoils of the owner of the laced coat. The women were away all this time.
<name>Coachman</name>	Coachman	George	"Get out of the way, you little devils," [MASK] cried to a small crowd of damp urchins, that were hanging about the chapel-door. The rain drove into the bride and bridegroom's faces as they passed to the chariot.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	William	She didn't wish to marry him, but she wished to keep him. She wished to give him nothing, but that he should give her all. It is a bargain not unfrequently levied in love. [MASK]'s sally had quite broken and cast her down.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Blanche	To see his wife and daughter suffering always put his Lordship into a good humour. "My sweet [MASK]," he said, "I am a gentleman, and never lay my hand upon a woman, save in the way of kindness.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Becky	"My relations won't cry fie upon me," [MASK] said, with rather a bitter laugh; and she was quite contented to wait until the old aunt should be reconciled, before she claimed her place in society.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Rawdon	this!--and it is for a thing like this that she must break her heart, forsooth--for a man who is stupid--a coxcomb--and who does not care for her. My poor good [MASK] is worth ten of this creature."
<name>he</name>	he	George	She did not know she called him by his Christian name, as [MASK] was accustomed to do. He went away with her quickly. Her lodgings were hard by; and they threaded through the crowd without, where everything seemed to be more astir than even in the ball-room within.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Jos	She was voted, in [MASK]'s female society, rather a pleasing young person--not much in her, but pleasing, and that sort of thing. The men, as usual, liked her artless kindness and simple refined demeanour.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rawdon	It seemed as if she was not an imposter any more, and was coming to the home of her ancestors. [MASK] was rather abashed and cast down, on the other hand. What recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across his brain?
<name>Cecily</name>	Cecily	Rawdon	"[MASK], don't be naughty!" his aunt exclaimed. "Well, his father's a City man--immensely rich, they say. Hang those City fellows, they must bleed; and I've not done with him yet, I can tell you.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Amelia	"Look," said [MASK], "this is his sash--isn't it a pretty colour?" and she took up the fringe and kissed it. She had tied it round her waist at some part of the day.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Amelia	But you shouldn't deal so hardly with me; you shouldn't be always catechising me. I am very fond of [MASK]; I adore her, and that sort of thing. Don't look angry. She's faultless; I know she is.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Rawdon	If I took her to the Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, and fly, I know she would; and might fall into that horrid [MASK]'s clutches again, and be the victim of that little viper of a Sharp.
<name>someone</name> (uncertain)	someone (uncertain)	Rebecca	The cunning diplomatist smiled inwardly as he owned that he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not to cry out against it. His satisfaction was not removed by [MASK]'s own statements, behaviour, and conversation.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Rebecca	On entering the dining-room, by the orders of the individual in gaiters, [MASK] found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms usually are, when genteel families are out of town. The faithful chambers seem, as it were, to mourn the absence of their masters.
<name>Mr. Earnshaw</name>	Mr. Earnshaw	Rawdon	His father would ride over many a time to see him here, and the elder [MASK]'s paternal heart glowed to see him rosy and dirty, shouting lustily, and happy in the making of mud-pies under the superintendence of the gardener's wife, his nurse.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	George	In a word, [MASK] had thrown the great cast. He was going to be married. Hence his pallor and nervousness--his sleepless night and agitation in the morning. I have heard people who have gone through the same thing own to the same emotion.
