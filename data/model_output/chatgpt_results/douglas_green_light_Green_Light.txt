<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Elise	[MASK] met him at the door in a grand state of exultation, threw her arms about him and stood on tiptoes to be kissed. He was happy to meet this impetuous display of gratitude, tendered in the presence of her grandfather, who, with beaming eyes, hovered close behind her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Phyllis	He sensed her presence as keenly as when she had sat close beside him in the taxi. Doubtless the feeling would pass, presently, and the image would fade, but for the moment [MASK] seemed very near—so near he could see the little gold flecks in the amber of her uplifted eyes.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sylvia	When I mentioned [MASK], she shut up like a clam and grew very sober. "'Later in the evening, as we were leaving, she pulled me aside and said she wanted to talk to me, and would I come to see her, the next afternoon.
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Life	In that brief, painful pause, his thoughts were running riot. How transparently clear it was that this shabby, disappointed country lawyer, whom [MASK] had shunted on to this grass-grown siding, hoped to win an hour of friendly attention with his droll persiflage.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Endicott	No matter if the twenty-dollar-a-week office clerk was kept in bed ten days longer than necessary. That wouldn't discommode the chief. No—[MASK] had not crashed from some dizzy height. He had been sliding for a long time.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nat	"After what?" asked [MASK] absently, for he, too, had been wool-gathering. "After the recital. What am I to do then? Come back here and wait for something to turn up? Have you any further plans for me?"
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Phyllis	And he would be right—as usual." "Yes, dear. Everything one does should somehow be good for the troops. You still believe that; don't you?" "And so do you," retorted [MASK], "for all your pretended spoofing.
<name>Mr. Shiftlet</name>	Mr. Shiftlet	Sonia	"Both right," [MASK] had declared laconically, "you and the stories you used to read. There has come a great change. The customer isn't quite so sure of herself. She doesn't know what minute she'll have to ask for credit.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Newell	But I'll say this much: if somebody had gone to the trouble of drilling that idea of life into me when I was in my teens—" The sentence was left unfinished. "Too late now, eh?" queried [MASK] moodily. "Certainly....
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Phyllis	There was a stir in the living-room, but no reply. "I'd rather be shot, myself," pursued [MASK], from the depth of her clothes-closet. "I've had a rough day, too, I'm telling you!"
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Parker	"Sit down, won't you?" said [MASK] cordially. "You may have the book at once, if you like. I have finished it. And I am rather glad you are interested, for I am making a little study of the question.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Paige	[MASK] studied his face and gave way to a smile. "A short time ago," he said cordially, "a very fine old chap was telling me about his experience in learning to drive a car. Fellow in front of him would come to a sudden stop without signalling.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Pat	She glanced from one to the other inquiringly, and [MASK], feeling she should be loyal to her hostess's well-intended intrigue, no matter how much she privately doubted the wisdom of it, explained, "We're going to have a pleasant little surprise for you in about a minute."
<name>Argos</name>	Argos	Sylvia	He brought her the lacquered box and was hovering over her with a lighted match when she suddenly answered his question. "He had left his dog at the house where she lives—a fine red setter. She recognized the dog—[MASK]."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Endicott	His face was flushed and the muscles of his cheeks twitched. The silence was taut. [MASK] seemed to sense it with defenceless irritation. Everybody in the room knew that he had been engaged in an emergency conversation with his brokers, and he knew that they all knew.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Phyllis	I think my—my affection went out to her more than to anyone else I ever met." "And [MASK] resembles her so much that you want to be sure she bears you no ill-will—is that it?" "
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Phyllis	"Oh—my darling!" he whispered. "Can this wonderful thing be true?" Sometimes, when half-mad with loneliness and desire for her, he had indulged himself in a fleeting speculation on the ecstasy of having [MASK] in his arms.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Phyllis	If it had been the other way about, and he had come to me—it would have been different." There was a little silence, and [MASK], coming to attention, seemed struggling with a desire to say something more—something that was difficult to express.
<name>the operator</name>	the operator	Sonia	"Maybe you will—tomorrow night!" "I'll—see," hesitated the Dean, after a lengthy pause. After [MASK] had put down the receiver, she sat for a while with puzzled eyes, tapping her knuckles against her pretty teeth.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Sonia	Besides—he was relieved. It wasn't that—she had promised. He laughed again, wheezing a little. "But it is a distressing predicament, just the same," affirmed [MASK], when the purple-faced doctor was again ready to listen.
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Sonia	You see, [MASK], there's a side of my life that would be seriously undernourished if I didn't have a few people in my thoughts whose welfare and happiness mean much to me. I cannot get about. It is too laborious to travel.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Paige	"1 can't remember much about it," said [MASK] listlessly. "She just now handed me this. It looks suspiciously like a fragment of somebody's corduroy trousers." "Yes—it's the seat. I know about it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Elise	Common civility suggested his cancelling the engagement he had with [MASK], but after experimenting with several explanations to account for his sudden departure, he damned all the half-scribbled pages into the waste-basket and gave it up.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Phyllis	She opened her eyes and smiled. "It's a lovely head," he told her softly. [MASK] sighed. "It has worried—a lot—about you," she whispered, regarding him with brooding affection. There was a long pause.
<name>She</name>	She	Sylvia	[MASK] probably had been up the mountain road far enough to sense the direction. A day earlier she had seen him climbing the slope. She had strolled out of the Gibson house and proceeded on her own, as any bright dog might have done under the circumstances....
<name>Calvin</name>	Calvin	Norwood	"There you are," said the Dean, directing himself toward the professor, almost as if they were alone. "That brings us back to the thing we were talking about the other day, [MASK]. You and I know exactly how we got our Protestantism.
<name>Carl Jung</name>	Carl Jung	Elizabeth	"We can go to the Caledonian thing any time. ... I think I would be glad to have another session with [MASK]." Most of the trip was done by buses and little was said on the way.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Harcourt	might supply a few of the missing links.... For a while he meditated a letter of inquiry; then an idea occurred to him. He pursed his lips and nodded. This, he thought, should fetch a query from [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Parker	The movement was gathering speed and momentum with such amazing ease that [MASK] was heartened to unplanned audacities. A drawing-room recital for an exclusive group of potential patronesses was arranged for the coming week. It was a notable success.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Phyllis	[MASK] thought of picking up a stick and brandishing it threateningly, but wasn't capable of putting the act into execution. She walked toward the dog, trying to explain and realizing how silly it was to suppose she would be understood.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Paige	[MASK] sat up again attentively, and she had a sudden suspicion that he was about to reopen the subject she had been trying so valiantly to avoid. It was quite evident that their futile sparring with each other, talking in cryptics and riddles, had come to an end.
<name>Halcyon</name>	Halcyon	Paige	"But I don't!" protested [MASK] sincerely. "Quite to the contrary. I never knew an operating nurse with a more authentic talent for surgery. If I haven't told you so, it's only because I don't bubble over."
<name>George</name>	George	Elise	And 1 was ready for it, you'd better believe. Big job of carpenter-work I had to do out there." "Bad break, was it?" [MASK] had heard the details twice, but knew he wanted to talk about it.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Paige	So I can go back. I'll be in charge now. Alone, too, until I can find somebody that's as big a damn' fool as I am." "Do you think / am?" asked [MASK] quietly.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Endicott	The young fellow he had admired and loved from childhood, and had counselled as a student, and promoted to a position of distinction, was in danger of losing his life. [MASK] took another generous gulp of his Scotch and soda.
<name>Helen Keller</name>	Helen Keller	Sonia	"I have the profoundest admiration for the man. I suppose no one— except possibly an experienced diagnostician—can even surmise the physical difficulties he has met." "But they have made him so great!" [MASK]'s tone was devout.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sylvia	After all, the wood ticks had given up the battle for the season, and the chances of [MASK]'s being bitten were very remote. Of course, there was all manner of stuff in the laboratory that she mustn't on any account get into, but they could easily keep her out of there.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Ingram	After nearly a half-mile of wearisome clambering over tumbled rocks, they agreed they'd had enough and sat down in the lee of a big one to smoke their pipes. [MASK] took off his cap, twenty minutes later, and cautiously drew himself up to peer over the top of the ledge.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Battery	He yawned, to encourage her to think that the problem wasn't really disastrous, and said he reckoned it was time for him to go to bed. "I've been a bit short of breath all day. Had to crank the old machine this morning. [MASK]'s worn out."
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Sylvia	When I couldn't stand it any more, we went into the bathroom and looked at ourselves, [MASK] standing up beside me with her paws on the basin. Then the whole thing began to seem funny and I laughed until my stomach ached.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sonia	Run into him accidentally out there?" [MASK] meditated a reply and thought she would like another cigarette. Her experienced host was happy to oblige. He brought her the lacquered box and was hovering over her with a lighted match when she suddenly answered his question. "
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Sonia	The Dean smiled enigmatically. "That woman is not my secretary," he said quietly. "She was my last caller— just before you came." [MASK]'s amazement parted her lips and narrowed her eyes. "Do you always make them do that?"
<name>Monsieur</name>	Monsieur	Parisian	My clients—my customers prefer to think I am [MASK]. I make no effort to counteract that belief. The place does have a foreign atmosphere. Perhaps I am theatrical—to the extent of playing a part in the course of my daily business."
<name>George</name>	George	Parker	The old man was fumbling with his sleeve button. [MASK] bared the arm, polished a little spot with a wisp of cotton saturated with alcohol, grasped the pathetically flabby skin with experienced fingers; and, tipping up the syringe, pushed the piston gently to expel the air.
<name>David</name>	David	Paige	The deep-set, pain-circled eyes seemed to ignore such superficial, impermanent phenomena as clothes and names, penetrating through to one's durable inner structure. "Thank you, sir," said [MASK] gratefully, drawing his chair a little closer. "
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Ingram	Deeply as he sympathized with his new friend, it was difficult at times for him to keep his face straight when the tempest was in full fury. He kept wondering whether [MASK]'s complete purgation of all his bottled-up venom was going to require him to turn himself inside-out also.
<name>she</name>	she	Phyllis	It was inconceivable that she would ever see him again. The conditions that would keep them apart were insurmountable, irrevocable. But she had, [MASK] felt, gained something of value by this chance meeting, however painful had been its eventuality.
<name>Zadok</name>	Zadok	Parker	"Was there snow in the Alps that time, too?" wondered the good-natured stranger. "Precisely—and the Morning Stars sang together." "How about the shoats?" "You'd make a good lawyer, Mr.—your name is [MASK], isn't it?
<name>Lina</name>	Lina	Elise	He could deliver the goods, however shady was the technique of propaganda. The point of it was, [MASK] could sing! Any measure that would help her to her rightful chance was pardonable. "You've been a darling!"
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Eugene	[MASK] had said that instructions were being followed in every detail. There was a pen-written postscript chaffing him. "As if it wasn't enough for you to lose your job and your name, you seem now to have lost your heart.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Masters	He pointed again at the crumpled bills on the table and began tearing up the profligate little I.O.U. into small, precise squares. [MASK] scowled and grinned. "/would have kept it," he muttered, "if I had won it from you."
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Phyllis	There was a little pause before the Dean commented on this remark. She reproached herself for having expressed the implied lament in the face of all he had done for her. "Don't stop hoping, [MASK]," he said slowly. "Hope is brimful of vitamins.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Paige	Once you've got a case all nerved up for an operation, it's—" The banal platitude perished of its own stupidity under the unfocused steel-blue stare. [MASK] wasn't hearing a word; just sitting there glowering at a distant ghost.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Phyllis	"It's almost killing me. I'm not sure how long I can stand it...." Then, shaking off his mood of despair, he asked, suddenly, "Is she bitter toward me?" "[MASK]?... Yes, and no.
<name>John</name>	John	Paige	The first page offered a brief apology for the manner in which the clipping had been sent, verified the Dean's guess that [MASK]'s pockets had furnished the blunt address, and explained the writer's special reasons for wanting to identify his patients to the full satisfaction of the Grey Lode Mining Corporation.
<name>Mrs. Hall</name>	Mrs. Hall	Elise	" "Perhaps he'll be all right," hoped [MASK]. "He always takes a medicine that helps. I've forgotten the name of it. He said last night that he had been neglecting it and had let himself down to about eighteen grains, whatever that may mean.
<name>Lassie</name>	Lassie	Phyllis	I don't want to give you up, but he needs you. Hurry up there and find him. And bark 'I love you!'... and do it a few times for me, too!" [MASK]'s eyes were misty when she scrambled to her feet.
<name>He</name>	He	Clara	" [MASK] missed the allusion, considered it an exuberant outburst of devotion, and squeezed his hand, whispering, "You two!" He had a notion to detain her and attempt to set her right, but she had scurried away, satisfied that her suspicions had been happily confirmed.
<name>Dr. Eckberg</name>	Dr. Eckberg	Newell	The wretched year passed in review, the humiliating pageant opening with the scene of his standing beside [MASK] when they were scrubbing up after the fatal operation. He had been too dismayed over what had just happened—on top of the announcement that he had lost a quarter of a million—to venture any conversation.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Parker	Shortly after nine, it suddenly occurred to [MASK], who had retired to his room early to read, that he should stroll down to the Graham house. It was in darkness except for the little dispensary where a single light glowed through the shutters.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	PAIGE	His eyes were misty as he wrote: "My dear Boy." CHAPTER XIX [MASK] patted the sand and gravel down evenly with the flat of his spade, and walking a little way apart sat, rather preoccupied, gazing at the small rectangular mound he had made.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Bunny	Life had not been very complicated for [MASK]. She had no talent for dramatizing the small episodes which sporadically punctuated her routine. An inordinate appetite for candy, cream, and other fattening refreshments had earned her the cherubic rolypolyness of a Delia Robbia medallion.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Elise	Quite pretty, too. [MASK] was not listening to it. 'Evening' quickly passed, swooning at the end as the organist permitted the wind to play out before removing her hands from the keys. The minister rose, and everybody stood with him.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Endicott	And he had already composed the quick reply, "Better let the matter rest the way it is." But [MASK]—damn him!—had buried his hairy arms and pallid face in the square porcelain tub, splashing and spluttering, without a single glance, much less a friendly word.
<name>The Man</name>	The Man	Elizabeth	Same kind of straining horses, bracing their lathery shoulders against the same hot collars, lashed and yelled at by the same cloddish drivers; and [MASK], up there, not listening, but hearing; not gladly approving, but accepting.... "So—what?
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Adam	We've always done it; have gone to war, again and again, over words and names. You may recall that in the legend reporting the creation of [MASK], the first thing that he did, after surveying his surroundings, was to name everything in sight.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Pat	You have to be, I think, before it means very much. I guess it's a good deal like planting a tree. You have to dig the hole first." "Perhaps I could qualify," said [MASK] dryly. "Let's have it."
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Sonia	commented [MASK], pretending a pout. "Just as I was having visions of myself at the Dean's right hand, maybe, in my new black velvet, comes an order to eat my porridge in the nursery along with another little girl."
<name>Flush</name>	Flush	Sylvia	"The only dog I know named [MASK] belongs to an exceptionally able and trustworthy young man of thirty-one whose decision to conceal his identity is inconvenient and embarrassing to himself and his friends, but reflects no discredit on him. "
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sonia	And there's another reason—plenty good, too—that you don't know about." On two or three previous occasions when confidences were being exchanged, [MASK] had cryptically turned the knob of her closet door with a hint that there was a rattle-able skeleton.
<name>he</name>	he	Newell	His longing to have another word with her—to replace the poignant memory of that ultimate "I'm sorry"—-was so strong that [MASK] tentatively sparred with the idea of writing her a note, but when he ventured in imagination upon the first sentence of it, he rejected the thought.
<name>Judy</name>	Judy	Phyllis	But last Sunday [MASK] had not only justified all his daydreaming: she had disclosed some charming little tricks of manner, gesture, inflection, that had made him want her with a longing too deep to be trusted to any words that might attempt to define his feeling.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Norwood	"I wondered if this wouldn't be a good way to teach history in college." "A novelty, at least," replied [MASK], interested in her eyes. "You could have a stage, and move them about."
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Sonia	[MASK] now arrived breezily, glanced suspiciously from one to the other, drew a long face, and intoned lugubriously, "If there are no further remarks concerning the deceased, we will now repair to the cemetery."
<name>himself</name>	himself	Jaqua	He was quite ecstatic over his favourite pupil's good fortune, and the fact that he was about to bask in the reflected gloiy of her talent made him garrulously enthusiastic. Who, indeed, had been chiefly responsible for the proper placement of that golden voice if not [MASK]?
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Sonia	This sounds a bit odd. You'd think a hunter wouldn't park his dog somewhere. They don't seem to want to talk about it. Of course I'm consumed by curiosity." [MASK] had finished the rest of the letter hastily.
<name>George</name>	George	Parker	"We'll be talking about it again, 1 hope." [MASK] tried to sound optimistic. "Something will open up. Meantime—don't be discouraged, and—I wish you the very best of good luck.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Norwood	Yes—I am a professor of history," snapped [MASK], suddenly aflame. "My trouble is located at that spot," he went on impetuously. "I came to the university as an associate professor in 1923. Two years later I was given a full professorship.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Paige	The childish interest these two big towns take in berating each other is quite beyond all sober calculation." "You don't belong out here, 1 take it," said [MASK] unnecessarily. "Nor anywhere." The grin accompanying the growl was unpleasant.
<name>Toto</name>	Toto	Phyllis	"You're a bright dog," he confided softly, pulling her ears. "Some day you'll tire of listening—and tell everything you've ever heard anyone say, won't you?" "She'd better not," threatened [MASK], in an aside.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Masters	He left his door open, knowing that [MASK] would pass it presently on the way to his own room. It was almost an hour before he came up. "Come in here a minute, won't you?"
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Parker	He made some frightful mistake that cost her life. Of course"—she went on, brokenly—"it was just a dreadful accident, and he must have been terribly sony. He ran away. They never saw him again." She lifted her swimming eyes to [MASK]'s face.
<name>Amy Lawrence</name>	Amy Lawrence	Pat	"I know it, and I've a notion she feels as if she'd been tugged feet-first through a knot-hole.... I had that experience, [MASK], and damn near cried my eyes out for three days.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sonia	I took the liberty of asking her if she remembered you. She seemed much pleased. I told her 1 would speak to you about it." "Do you want me to take her in with me?" [MASK] searched his eyes. "Why not?
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Phyllis	Of course, no apron could ever hope to look like that on anybody else, but a lot of women might think it would. What an adorable figure you have, [MASK]." "Thankee, mum."
<name>Ellinor</name>	Ellinor	Elise	[MASK]'s voice was tender. "Yes—will you be content not to ask me anything more about it? It's a very painful subject." She nodded reluctantly and laid her hand on his. "Will I ever be told?" she asked.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Sonia	"Who would ever have thought that you could pop off like that!" [MASK] laid a hand on her knee. "Forgive me, won't you?" she entreated contritely. "I didn't mean to hurt you."
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Endicott	Did 1 understand you, sir? Whisky, sir?" "Yes—you understood me. Go and get it." [MASK] had not stirred from his supine slump in the red-leather chair before the grate.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Stafford	[MASK]'s eyes widened with interest. The three of them halted and considered each other in an embarrassing silence for a moment, and since it was high time somebody offered an observation, no matter how unimportant, the older man ventured the opinion that it had been a pleasant afternoon.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Parker	[MASK] queried with surprise. "I had no idea he was a university graduate; seems so young for that," he added quickly. "Oh, I know he doesn't look much like it, around here, helping in the kitchen and doing all manner of odd jobs.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Norwood	It would probably have killed a normal man long since." [MASK] was spared the necessity of comment by the announcement that dinner was served. The Dean was already in his chair at the head of the table when they arrived in the dining-room.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Ingram	"When I'm sober, then, little one, if you're so sensitive." [MASK] slumped into a chair, scowled, grinned, mopped his face, and said he needed a bowl of hot onion soup.
<name>John</name>	John	Talbot	The room was very quiet. "Yes," he repeated, after a little silence, "I think so... appointed to go through it." "Because they're stronger, better, fitter?" wondered [MASK]. "No—not necessarily.
<name>he</name>	he	Parker	He was happy to meet this impetuous display of gratitude, tendered in the presence of her grandfather, who, with beaming eyes, hovered close behind her. Everything now was exactly as it should be, [MASK] felt.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Parker	He was spry—too spry. One afternoon [MASK] accompanied him into the country to make a call, tactfully suggesting in the course of their conversation that physical exercise could easily be overdone. More people in mature life, he thought, were damaged by overactivity than underactivity.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Sylvia	Reckless of [MASK]'s precarious dignity on the slippery rumble seat, she illegally swung herself around in the middle of the busy block, narrowly missing a ten-ton removal-van, and earning an impolite salutation from the burly driver of a gasoline tank.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sonia	"I think he might," she added. "And / think he did!" said [MASK] decisively. "There are people loyal enough to do that. I fancy he's one of'em." "We'll probably never know."
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Phyllis	After a moment's reflection with averted eyes she said calmly, "He fell in love with my sister." [MASK] winced and gave a quick little breath of pained surprise, but offered no comment, for it was to be quite a long story and she must not interrupt.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Sylvia	Presently she saw them coming, [MASK] leaping ahead and running back to him in hysterical swoops. He was roughly clad in heavy corduroy trousers thrust into high boots, a leather jacket, and an old, battered, grey felt hat drawn well down over his eyes.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Clay	Surely that proved how attractive he was, for [MASK] was always so reserved with strangers. He had honestly liked her voice, too. He wasn't saying it just to be polite. You can tell. "Distinguished talent.
