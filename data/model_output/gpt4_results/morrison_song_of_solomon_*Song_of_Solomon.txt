<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Ruth	([MASK] was still frightened of her a little. Not just her short hair cut regularly like a man’s, or her large sleepy eyes and busy lips, or the smooth smooth skin, hairless, scar less, and wrinkleless.
<name>Sylvester</name>	Sylvester	Milkman	He chuckled. “Wish mine was here. Been waitin fifty-seven years and it ain’t come yet.” The other men in the store laughed congenially, while [MASK] stood frozen, everything in him quiet but his heart. There was no mistaking the message.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	Guitar	You know he did. You were laughing right along with the rest of us.” [MASK] glanced at him. “What you opening your nose for?” “I know when I’m being put off.” “Then that’s what it is, man.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Porter	.” “[MASK].” “. . . in a clean white boat.” “No.” “Instead of picnics . . .” “No.” “. . . and fishing . . .” “No.” “. . .
<name>Hagar</name>	Hagar	Hagar	A hickey was forming on his forehead by the time he got to her. “What you all got in there?” he asked her. “That’s Pilate’s stuff. She calls it her inheritance.” [MASK] was unbuttoning her blouse.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Macon	[MASK] tried to button his pants and get away without waking him, but the leaves and twigs crunching under his feet pulled the man all the way out of his sleep. He raised his head, turned over, and smiled.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Milkman	[MASK] had to blink twice before their faces returned to the vaguely alarmed blandness he was accustomed to. Quickly he left the room, realizing there was no one to thank him—or abuse him. His action was his alone. It would change nothing between his parents.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Milkman	Pass it on! ” But they shot the top of his head off and ate his fine Georgia peaches. And even as boys these men began to die and were dying still. Looking at [MASK] in those nighttime talks, they yearned for something.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Reba	Treading as lightly as he could, he crept up to the side window where the candlelight flickered lowest, and peeped in. [MASK] was cutting her toenails with a kitchen knife or a switchblade, her long neck bent almost to her knees.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ma’am	As she made herself comfortable, she inched her dress up a little. “Yes, visiting.” “You in the service?” “[MASK]? Oh, no. I was hunting last night. Some friends lent me these.”
<name>State</name>	State	Guitar	“You ain’t heard? People say the police is lookin for a colored man what killed that white boy in the schoolyard.” “I know that. Everybody knows that.” “Well, the description fits State. And [MASK] been takin him places.
<name>Missy</name>	Missy	Circe	Then a few weeks passed and [MASK] came to my daddy’s shop. Right across from where the post office is now—that’s where my daddy’s blacksmith shop was. She came in there with this little metal box with a piece of paper bag folded up in it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Guitar	Eventually they covered her and all he could see was a mound of tangled tulips bent low over her body, which was kicking to the last. He described all of that to [MASK] as though the dream emphasized his point about the dangers of seriousness.
<name>Velma</name>	Velma	Hagar	“What’s the worst? What’s the worst thing can happen? We bust in, right? Suppose all three of them are there. They’re women. What can they do? Whip us?” “Maybe.” “Come on! Who? [MASK]?
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Circe	One morning [MASK] climbed all the way to the third floor with a covered plate of scrapple and found two empty rooms. They didn’t even take a blanket. Just a knife and a tin cup. The first day out was joyous for them.
<name>Is</name>	Is	Issat	“Still living, is she?” “Oh, yes. Very much living.” “[MASK] so? Pretty girl, real pretty. My daddy was the one made the earring for her. That’s how we knew they was alive.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guitar	Everybody wants something from me, you know what I mean? Something they think they can’t get anywhere else. Something they think I got. I don’t know what it is—I mean what it is they really want.” [MASK] stretched his legs.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Ruth	[MASK] stood still and looked at the woman’s back. It didn’t look like death’s back at all. It looked vulnerable, soft, like an easily wounded shin, full of bone but susceptible to the slightest pain.
<name>Stamp</name>	Stamp	Milkman	I would of loved ’em all. If I’d a knowed more, I would a loved more.” [MASK] bent low to see her face and saw darkness staining his hand. Not sweat, but blood oozing from her neck down into his cupped hand.
<name>Gein</name>	Gein	Omar	“Not his dead life; I mean his living life.” When he reached the genitals he cut them off, but left the scrotum intact. “It's the condition our condition is in.” [MASK] cut around the legs and the neck.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Milkman	Luckily for [MASK], she had proved, so far, to be the world’s most inept killer. Awed (even in the midst of her anger) by the very presence of her victim, she trembled violently and her knife thrusts and hammer swings and ice-pick jabs were clumsy.
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Macon	He crashed forward, then turned his head to look up at them. His mouth moved and he mumbled something that sounded like “What for?” [MASK] stabbed him again and again until he stopped moving his mouth, stopped trying to talk, and stopped jumping and twitching on the ground.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Reba	“Looking for a toilet.” [MASK] threw her head back to let the laughter escape. Her hands were stained with blackberry juice, and when she wiped the tears from her eyes she streaked the purple from her nose to her cheekbone.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Milkman	You come up here knowing it’s the thirtieth day. Knowing if anybody wants to find you they come here if not first then last. And you ask me to leave you by yourself. Just tell me what you doing.” “Look,” [MASK] said.
<name>Monroe</name>	Monroe	Mercy	He delivered both your sisters himself and each time all he was interested in was the color of their skin. He would have disowned you. I didn’t like the notion of his being his own daughter’s doctor, especially since she was also my wife. [MASK] wouldn’t take colored then.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Hitler	Each and every one of them could do it. So you just get any one of them. There are no innocent white people, because every one of them is a potential nigger-killer, if not an actual one. You think [MASK] surprised them?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Guitar	“I can’t buy it, [MASK].” “I know that.” “There’s too much wrong with it.” “Tell me.” “Well, for one thing, you’ll get caught eventually.” “Maybe.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Hagar	The lid sprang open and [MASK] saw a tiny part of her face reflected in the mirror. She took the compact then and stared into the mirror for a long while. “No wonder,” she said at last. “Look at that. No wonder.
<name>Rusty</name>	Rusty	Milkman	[MASK] waited on the sidewalk, staring at the curtained window of the beauty shop. Beauty shops always had curtains or shades up. Barbershops didn’t. The women didn’t want anybody on the street to be able to see them getting their hair done.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Nephew	Had [MASK] got his suitcase? What equipment would he need? Flashlight and what else? What story should be in his mind in case he was discovered? Of course: looking for his grandfather’s remains—to collect them and take them for a proper burial.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Pilate	Nor was there any gathering at the table. [MASK] might bake hot bread and each one of them would eat it with butter whenever she felt like it. Or there might be grapes, left over from the winemaking, or peaches for days on end.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Milkman	Now they were sauntering about, doing chores, teasing cats, throwing bread to stray chickens, and some of them were playing their endless round games. [MASK] could hear them singing and wandered off toward them and the huge cedar that reared up over their heads.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Milkman	“I never spent much time smacking my lips over another man’s dick.” Everybody smiled, including [MASK]. It was about to begin. “What about his ass hole? Ever smack your lips over that?”
<name>Stuttering</name>	Stuttering	Guitar	You and him ain’t the only ones! ” Even while he was screaming he wondered why he was suddenly so defensive—so possessive about his name. He had always hated that name, all of it, and until he and [MASK] became friends, he had hated his nickname too.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Lincoln	He called our farm [MASK]’s Heaven. It was a little bit a place. But it looked big to me then. I know now it must a been a little bit a place, maybe a hundred and fifty acres. We tilled fifty.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Milkman	“Wish I could do that; maybe I could get back into a twelve. But it’s never going to happen now.” She pressed one hand on her hip and smiled at [MASK]. “What did you want to see me about?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Guitar	He thought [MASK] was going to let him in on some deal he had going. But he was slipping into his race bag. He was speaking slowly, as though each word had to count, and as though he were listening carefully to his own words.
<name>Mouse</name>	Mouse	Guitar	Everywhere. The law is the law.” “You wanna bet? This is sure money! ” “You stupid, man. Real stupid. Ain’t no law for no colored man except the one sends him to the chair,” said [MASK].
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Guitar	Front page. I bet five dollars on front page.” “What the fuck is the difference?” shouted [MASK]. “A kid is stomped and you standin round fussin about whether some cracker put it in the paper. He stomped, ain’t he?
<name>Orion</name>	Orion	Pilate	Here in this dim room he sat with the woman who had helped deliver his father and [MASK]; who had risked her job, her life, maybe, to hide them both after their father was killed, emptied their slop jars, brought them food at night and pans of water to wash.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Milkman	Annoyed by [MASK]’s indifference, he relieved his agitation by straightening up the room. He pulled an empty crate from underneath the straight-backed chair leaning in the corner, and started dumping trash into the box: dead matches from the window sill, pork bones from the barbecue he had eaten the day before.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macon	But the stronger it got, the more desolate he became. Alone, without [MASK], he let the events of the night come back to him—he remembered little things, details, and yet he wasn’t sure these details had really happened.
<name>Solomon</name>	Solomon	Solomon	Can you tell me?” She shrugged. “I don’t think he had one. He was one of those flying African children. They must all be dead a long time now.” “Flying African children?” “Um hm, one of [MASK]’s children.
<name>She</name>	She	Neither	[MASK] said a word during the forty-five minutes they waited in the little shelter for the train back to the city. The sun came up and pointed out the names of young lovers painted on the wall. A few men were walking up the stairs to the platform.
<name>Florsheim</name>	Florsheim	Joyce	It was in a part of the room so dark he had not even seen it. She walked over to the table and lifted from it a green-and-white shoe box, its cover held down with a rubber band. “[MASK],” it said on the box.
<name>James</name>	James	Milkman	They were very well dressed, too well dressed to be eating pork out of a box, but on that warm September day it seemed natural, a perfect addition to the mellowness that pervaded the park. [MASK] was curious about his father’s agitation, but not alarmed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Corinthians	[MASK] turned up her nose and refused outright, so they made me go. I had on heels too. I was a girl too, but they made me go. You and I had to slide down a little slope off the shoulder of the road.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Guitar	And now the one woman who claimed to love him more than life, more than her life, actually loved him more than his life, for she had spent half a year trying to relieve him of it. And [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pilate	New clothes. Everything I have is a mess.” They looked at each other. “What you need?” asked [MASK]. “I need everything,” she said, and everything is what she got.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Feather	“Yeah. He wouldn’t let us in. I go in there all the time. All the time and he don’t say nothing. But today he throws us out. Said my friend here is too young. Can you beat that? [MASK]?
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Macon	“She was just trying to keep the wedding going, keep you from fucking it up.” “[MASK], please don’t use that language in front of the children.” “What goddam children? Everybody in here is old enough to vote.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Macon	“I need you here, [MASK]. If you were going to go, you should have gone five years ago. Now I’ve come to depend on you.” It was difficult for him to beg, but he came as close to it as he could.
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Macon	“If you pull that trigger,” shouted [MASK], “you better not miss. If you take a shot you better make sure I’m dead, cause if you don’t I’m gonna shoot your balls up in your throat!”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Guitar	No, you can’t.” “But people who lynch and slice off people’s balls—they’re crazy, [MASK], crazy.” “Every time somebody does a thing like that to one of us, they say the people who did it were crazy or ignorant.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Guitar	Bushes with little bitsy white tea bags blossoming. Right?” “Gimme the tea, [MASK]. Just the tea. No geography.” “No geography? Okay, no geography. What about some history in your tea? Or some sociopolitico— No.
<name>Wickson</name>	Wickson	Macon	It was this combination of daintiness and cultivated speech that misled [MASK] and invited him to regard her as merely foolish. “You should get out once in a while.” She looked at him. “Is this your house now? Did they will you this?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ruth	[MASK] sat still, letting the anger and determination jell. She wondered whose bed it was and lifted up the blanket and saw only mattress ticking. The same was true of the next bed, but not of the third. It had sheets, a pillow, and a pillow slip.
<name>Essie</name>	Essie	Ruth	Some folks want to live forever. Some don’t. I believe they decide on it anyway. People die when they want to and if they want to. Don’t nobody have to die if they don’t want to.” [MASK] felt a chill.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Milkman	I’d love for her to find somebody, but I know that man. I—I’ve been around him. And I don’t think he . . .” [MASK] stopped, unable to explain. About the Days, about what he suspected. “Oh?”
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Pilate	And again there was a change. [MASK] was tall again. The top of her head, wrapped in a silk rag, almost touched the roof of the car, as did theirs. And her own voice was back.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Milkman	His wife answered and told him that her husband was still at the freightyard and he could catch him there if he hurried. [MASK] thanked her and hung up. Walking like a pimp in delicate shoes, he managed to get to the yard, which was fairly close to the bus station.
<name>Milkman</name>	Milkman	Lena	Standing there in the lamplight, trying not to think of how his father had looked creeping along the wall, he heard a knock at his door. He didn’t want to see the face of [MASK] or Corinthians, nor to have any secret talk with his mother.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Macon	“I haven’t changed my mind, [MASK]. I don’t want you over there.” “Why? You still haven’t said why.” “Just listen to what I say. That woman’s no good.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Porter	Well, there is a difference between a woman and a lady, and I know you know which one I am.” [MASK] pulled the car over to the curb, and without shutting off the motor, leaned across her and opened the door.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Nero	“Yeah. The whole town planning a parade,” said [MASK]. “They got to catch ’em.” “So they catch ’em. You think they’ll get any time? Not on your life!” “How can they not give ’em time?”
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Pilate	“A brother is a brother if you both got the same mother or if you both—” [MASK] interrupted her. “I mean what’s the difference in the way you act toward ’em? Don’t you have to act the same way to both?”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Calvin	What did [MASK] see on the bark? On the ground? What was he saying? What did he hear that made him know something unexpected had happened some two miles—perhaps more—away, and that that something was a different kind of prey, a bobcat?
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Macon	May as well be a rainbow. “Now, we lost and there was this wind and in front of us was the back of our daddy. We were some scared children. [MASK] kept telling me that the things we was scared of wasn’t real.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pilate	And [MASK] is a little nuts, but she wanted us out of there. If she hadn’t been smart, both our asses would be cooling in the joint right now.” “My ass. Not yours. She wanted you out, not me.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Corinthians	They were quiet for a minute, then he turned over and parted her legs with his. [MASK] looked down at him. “Is this for me?” she asked. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, this is for you.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Reba	All they knew to do was love her and since she would not speak, they brought things to please her. For the first time in life [MASK] tried to win things. And, also for the first time, couldn’t.
<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Milkman	His voice now was loud and deep—loud enough and deep enough for two. [MASK] slid his hands into his back pockets and followed his friend to the door. He stretched his neck a little to match the chilly height he hoped the soldiers had seen in his eyes.
<name>Gilgamesh</name>	Gilgamesh	Guitar	Without wiping away the tears, taking a deep breath, or even bending his knees—he leaped. As fleet and bright as a lodestar he wheeled toward [MASK] and it did not matter which one of them would give up his ghost in the killing arms of his brother.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Hagar	What harm did I do you on my knees? He could hear her footsteps, and then the sound of the doorknob turning, sticking, and turning again. He knew, without uncovering his eyes, that she was right there, looking at him through the window. [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Milkman	“Pretty good.” [MASK] felt as awkward as he sounded. He had never had to try to make a pleasant impression on a stranger before, never needed anything from a stranger before, and did not remember ever asking anybody in the world how they were.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Guitar	That boy there can go. That one.” She pointed to a cat-eyed boy about five or six years old. The stout woman slid her eyes down the nurse’s finger and looked at the child she was pointing to. “[MASK], ma’am.”
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Porter	for you. Instead of roses. And silk underwear and bottles of perfume.” “[MASK].” “Instead of chocolate creams in a heart-shaped box. Instead of a big house and a great big car. Instead of long trips . . .”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Susan	“Would you like a cup of coffee or some tea?” “Sure. Thanks.” “Which one?” “Coffee’s all right.” “You’ve got butter cookies, [MASK]. Give him some of those butter cookies.”
<name>Reuben</name>	Reuben	Milkman	“You want me to talk or not?” “Go ahead. Talk. Just don’t talk to me in that funny tone. Like you a teacher and I’m some snot-nosed kid.” “That’s the problem, [MASK].
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Marcelline	“Can you take her? I can’t, I know.” [MASK] peered deeply into her customer’s scalp. “Hadn’t planned on any late work. I got two more coming. This is my eighth today.” No one spoke.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Milkman	Especially if the object of his craving is not gingerbread or chewy gumdrops, but gold. [MASK] ducked under the boughs of black walnut trees and walked straight toward the big crumbling house. He knew that an old woman had lived in it once, but he saw no signs of life there now.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Milkman	It was an interesting train of thought, and new for him. Never had he thought of his mother as a person, a separate individual, with a life apart from allowing or interfering with his own. [MASK] put on his jacket and left the house.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Guitar	His eyes were milky, like those of very old people, but the rest of him was firm, lithe, and young-looking. His tone was casual but suggested authority nonetheless. “No, sir.” [MASK] answered him over his shoulder.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Porter	“You on for five.” “Wait a minute,” [MASK] shouted. “Say where.” “What you mean, ‘where’? I got five says it’ll be in the morning paper.”
<name>Skeeter</name>	Skeeter	Freddie	“It was on the radio! Got to be in the paper!” said [MASK]. “They don’t put that kind of news in no white paper. Not unless he raped somebody.” “What you bet?
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Hagar	When he first took her in his arms, [MASK] was a vain and somewhat distant creature. He liked to remember it that way—that he took her in his arms—but in truth it was she who called him back into the bedroom and stood there smiling while she unbuttoned her blouse.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Milkman	Love, I guess. But I always thought it was trying to take care of children by themselves, you know what I mean?” She talked on and on while [MASK] sat back and listened to gossip, stories, legends, speculations.
<name>Elisa</name>	Elisa	Ruth	[MASK] let the seaweed disintegrate, and later, when its veins and stems dropped and curled into brown scabs on the table, she removed the bowl and brushed away the scabs. But the water mark, hidden by the bowl all these years, was exposed.
<name>Silla</name>	Silla	Milkman	“You think I don’t know how to walk when I want to walk? Put your money back in your pocket.” Rebuffed from his fine feelings, [MASK] matched her cold tone: “You loved those white folks that much?” “Love?”
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Guitar	The cords of his neck tightened. How? In [MASK]’s room, did she . . . ? What difference did it make? He had hurt her, left her, and now she was dead—he was certain of it. He had left her.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Pilate	Be here at nine-thirty.” There were twenty-five or thirty families on that island and when [MASK] made it clear that she wasn’t afraid of work, but didn’t like the mainland and the confinement of town, she was taken in.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Esther	I mean if you do drink, that is.” “Sure. Sure. Nothing citified, I’m sorry to say, but— [MASK]!” She was on her way to the kitchen. “Bring some glasses and get that whiskey out the cupboard.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Pilate	“Now, what were your instructions from me?” “You told me to stay away from there. To stay away from [MASK].” “Right.” “But you never told me why. They’re our cousins. She’s your own sister.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Qrce	Snow was everywhere and I couldn’t hardly find my way. I looked up [MASK] first, then went looking for the cave. It was a hard trek, I can tell you, and I was in frail condition. Snow piled up every which way.
<name>Denver</name>	Denver	Milkman	“Over here, brother man! Can you see me?” [MASK] cupped his mouth with one hand and waved the other over his head. “Here I am!” Am am am am, said the rocks. “You want me? Huh?
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Milk	“Why don’t you get her people to do something?” “I am her people.” “Listen, [MASK], I’ll split if you say so. But just listen to me a minute. That broad had a Carlson skinning knife last time.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Milkman	She would abide by this commandment from her father herself, and make him do it too. “You just can’t fly on off and leave a body.” Suddenly [MASK] began to laugh. Curled up like a Polish sausage, a rope cutting his wrists, he laughed.
<name>Hagar</name>	Hagar	Pilate	“I thought you were him. I thought you came back to see me. Where is he? My Macon?” “Back home. He’s alive. He told me about you. . . .” “And [MASK]. Where is she?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Guitar	Please get it, son. Get the gold.” Chapter 8 Every night now [MASK] was seeing little scraps of Sunday dresses—white and purple, powder blue, pink and white, lace and voile, velvet and silk, cotton and satin, eyelet and grosgrain.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Ruth	She sprinkled a little of it into her hand and offered it to [MASK], who obediently took a lump and put it in her mouth. As soon as she tasted it, felt its crunchiness, she asked for more, and ate half a box before she left.
