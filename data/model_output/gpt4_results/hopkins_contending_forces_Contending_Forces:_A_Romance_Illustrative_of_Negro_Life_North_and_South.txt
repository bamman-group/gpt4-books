<name>Christie</name>	Christie	Dora	“ I see. The mess of pottage and the birthright.” “ Bless you! not so bad as that; but money makes the mare go,” returned [MASK], with a wink at her friend, and a shrewd business look on her bright little Yankee face.

<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Will	“ But I’m not your 1 women folks.’ ” “ Look here,” said [MASK] in an aggrieved tone, balancing a hod of ashes in one hand and a pile of stove brushes in the other, “ are we going to quarrel ? ”
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Will	“What is it, [MASK]? what has happened?” cried his mother and sister with one voice. Great drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead. “ O my God ! ” was his reply to the agonized entreaties of the two women.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dora	Her great desire, then, was to make them as happy together as possible, and to this end she had [MASK] institute musical evenings or reception nights, that her tenants might have a better opportunity of becoming acquainted with each other.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Will	There can’t be any great mystery about her absence.” Just then the door-bell rang. “ There she is now,” said [MASK], as he bounded down the stairs in answer to the summons. The two women stood expectant, waiting for the sound of her voice-
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Alphonse	[MASK] can stay with us; you can pay a stipulated sum for his board and be able to see him every week. What do you think of it, my daughter?” “ I will do as you advise, Mother; you are only too kind.
<name>Wentworth</name>	Wentworth	Will	But they are trying to take all the credit for the good we may have done them, from us. The lines are drawn more sharply than before the emancipation. Constitutional amendments are dead letters; the ballot-box is nil,” replied [MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Will	“ Be assured that I shall bend every effort to prove this story, and spare no money to establish you in your rights.” Then, unable longer to control his feelings, telling [MASK] to join him in an hour at his hotel, he hastily left them.
<name>Si</name>	Si	Hank	“ That’s all well enough to talk,” replied [MASK], “ but what kin a man do agin the money thet thet feller’s got to back him up? I cayn’t see a handle on him.”
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Sappho	“ I had to live, my dear; I could not teach school, because my education does not include a college course. I could not do housework, because my constitution is naturally weak.” It was noticeable in these confidential chats that [MASK] never spoke of her early life.
<name>Saxon</name>	Saxon	Sappho	[MASK] confessed her ignorance. “ Christian Science is a faith-cure; that is, it’s usin’ yer brains an’ trainin’ ’em to know that there’s nuthin’ ’tall the matter with you ef you only think there ain’t.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Dora	The marks of servitude and oppression are dropping slowly from us; let us hasten the transformation of the body by the nobility of the soul.” For of the soul the body form doth take, For soul is form and doth the body make, quoted [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Langley	It’s going to cost you something; yes, sir, right smart.” “ I tell you, [MASK], we have a hard fight to give your people even the little that they do get. It’s your duty to listen to reason in this matter.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sappho	“ Heaven bless you, [MASK], my dearest. I shall never tire of ringing the changes on love.” “Why should you care so much for me?” she asked wistfully. “ I have no family — no friends — no money ” —
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Will	They heard nothing but the closing of the door and [MASK]’s steps returning. Presently he stood before them with a letter in his hand. “ It is for me,” he said, in answer to their looks of inquiry.
<name>With</name>	With	Receiving	[MASK] no answer she rapped again, and then tried the handle of the door. It yielded to her touch, and then she noticed that the key was on the outside. She threw the door open with a vague sense of something unusual in such a proceeding.
<name>McGuire</name>	McGuire	John	“Well, here’s an order on the committee for money waiting to be used in your district in an emergency. Draw when you need it.” Then he arose from his chair to take his leave. “Mighty good cigars you keep, [MASK].”
<name>McGinty</name>	McGinty	John	“ Ha, ha, ha! ” laughed [MASK], as he lay back in his chair and winked at the Colonel, “ that’s a good one! What do you think I’ve been doing since I’ve been in the law business in this city?
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	John	“ Do you not know that the house is empty ? ” “I do; and as I wish to speak with you privately, and as this is my only chance, I will not let it slip me,” said [MASK]. “ Really!
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Will	We girls must look to our laurels if you keep on growing so pretty.” “ Well, my love, I have been thinking of your father tonight, and how happy we were when you and [MASK] were wee tots.”
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	chile	“ Lor’, [MASK], I had to have a new light silk fer that, I tell yer. An’ sech a time as I had when I went to git me a pair o’ paten’ leather shoes.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Jesse	The two children followed their mother closely. They were sturdy boys, who resembled her in the beauty of their features; and in [MASK], the baby, a still greater resemblance could be traced, because the hair had been allowed to remain in long, soft curls.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Tommy	She was a good worker, experienced in married life and ways of making a man comfortable. Then her savings must be considered. When [MASK] reached this last point he always felt sure that she was the most desirable woman in the world for a young minister.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	John	Never till this moment have I realized the depths of my degradation! ” “ I go at your command,” said [MASK]. “ I give you one week to think over what I have said. At the end of that time ” — “ Go!
<name>John</name>	John	Smith	Although love had come to [MASK] like a flood sweeping all barriers before it, yet the very strength of his desire for her love but served to restrain decided action. He approached the desired end slowly and carefully, not to defeat his own plans.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Will	He has invested some money in a small annuity for our humble friends, — enough to keep them from want. The nobility of this man is something remarkable. We sail from here for home by the next steamer, so we shall be in time for the wedding. Your loving son, [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Beaubean	[MASK] seized them and hurled them into the villain’s face with these words: ‘I leave you to carry my case into the Federal courts and appeal for justice.’ Unhappy man! That night his house was mobbed.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	John	Think of [MASK], too ! How did he find it out ? what a heartless scamp he must be! I confess the whole thing is an enigma to me.” “To think she should believe us capable of feeling anything for her but sympathy!
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Montfort	“ I promise; but it is all nonsense.” “ I shall hold you to your promise,” replied [MASK] solemnly. The committee on public safety generally met once a month. They had a chairman, but no one knew his identity save a chosen few of the committee.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sappho	They gazed with surprise upon the child, and could not be convinced when told that he was a Negro, and identified by ties of blood with the blackest men and women in the crowded company. In a distant corner [MASK] sat keeping a strict account of the moneys received.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Wall	“ [MASK], as I was a-sayin’, ter perceed, by a lucky chance it wuz my fust choice, an’ I choose the gal. I knowed she wuz a fust-class breeder an’ my muney wuz shure fer a hundred per cent on her.”

<name>Alroy</name>	Alroy	Jesse	It seemed to him that he was answered: “ Many days, and even years; but fear not, we will never leave thee.” After that night [MASK]’s childhood appeared to slip from him, and he became a man in thought.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Sappho	[MASK] turned the key in the lock and sank upon the couch overcome with the horror of her situation. Nervous spasms shook her frame as she mentally measured the abyss of social ostracism and disgrace which confronted her. A thunderbolt from a clear sky had shattered her hopes and dashed the cup of happiness from her lips.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Anna	despised by the blacks of his own race, scorned by the whites ! Let him go out and hang himself! ” In her indignation [MASK] forgot the scissors, and bit her thread off viciously with her little white teeth.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Dora	“ And your teeth, your beautiful white teeth, where will they be shortly if you persist in eating a pound of bonbons every day? Think of your fate, [MASK], and pause in your reckless career — forty inches about the waist and only scraggy snags to show me when you grin! ”
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Lincoln	You’re jeopardizing the best chance you ever had since [MASK] issued the Emancipation Proclamation.” “ That’s all right. Promises are like pie-crust, made to be broken. You may be the best we can do, and the best is d-------- poor.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mercy	[MASK] knows, I don’t blame her. I aliens thought he had a downish sort o’ look. Drat them sickly, peeky lookin’ men! Me! no mam ! I wouldn’t look at one o’ them ! No ma’m! Dear, dear!
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Dora	Don’t you ever expect to marry, and don’t you speculate about the pros and cons and the maybes and perhapses of the situation?” asked [MASK], as she filled the cups with steaming cocoa and passed one to her friend.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bill	Ef we’s goin’ inter this business, we’s got to be square on the deal with our fren’s. Who’s the bottom o’ this thing ? ” [MASK] produced a plug of tobacco, offered his friend a chew and took one himself.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Will	“ What matter ? ” was his inward thought, “ some day we shall change all this.” The first course was about over before [MASK] had a chance to look about him. He did not feel at all overpowered by the grandeur displayed.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Will	Had you no confidence in my love for you ? How meanly you must have judged me if you thought me capable of holding you responsible for the monstrous wrong committed against you.” “ Ah, [MASK]; I had suffered so much at the hands of selfish men!
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Sappho	“ I give you one week to think over what I have said. At the end of that time ” — “ Go! go! will you go ? ” interrupted [MASK], pointing to the door with queenly dignity.

<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Sister	Suddenly a door opened behind him and a voice said: “ I will bring him back tomorrow, [MASK].” Surely he knew that voice ! He turned, and there before his blinded vision stood the realization of his dream, holding the boy by the hand !
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Will	She knew that her mother had always felt that no woman could be good enough for [MASK]’s wife. She felt instinctively that her mother had faced the difficulty alone that evening and conquered it, effacing herself and her desires for the happiness of her son.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Sappho	No one recognized her, for a complete change had been made in the Sisterhood. A long spell of low fever ensued, but to [MASK] in her weakness the rest and comfort that came to her harassed mind was like sun and shade in a grassy glade of perfect peace.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	John	It was plain then that a few hours would end the sufferings of the remainder. The last spark of fire had gone out. Two biscuits and a quart of water was all the sustenance left. Delirium seized upon all but [MASK]. He felt sick at heart.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dora	“ Give him this ! ” cried [MASK], snatching her engagement ring from her finger. “ Tell him I hope never to see his face again.” “ Poor little sister. Must you suffer, too ? ”
<name>Personally</name>	Personally	Ginerally	I’m all of thirty-five. [MASK] speakin’, I never tell nobody my exac’ age, ’cause it’s none o’ thar bisiness.” “ Thirty-Jive years ! Impossible ! Why, it’s thirty-five years since the war.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dora	“ Ta, ta, then, until Sunday night. I sha’n’t see you before that. I shall be lost for the remainder of the week ‘ getting ready for company ’ ”; and [MASK], with a gay laugh, ran lightly down the stairs.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mabelle	The crowd surrounded the building after firing it, and as an inmate would show his head at a window in the struggle to escape from the burning building, someone would pick him off. So it went all that night. I seized [MASK] and wrapped her in a blanket.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	We can be organized, if the work is done by the right ones and in the right way. We can help start a new party, if nothing more.” “ That won’t do any good, [MASK], we can down you.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Hank	“ Damn it all, man, why don’t yer let out ? ” demanded [MASK], as he rose excitedly from his seat on the log. “ I’m the man to help on anythin’ agin thet man, an’ yer knows it.
<name>Mrs. Baxter</name>	Mrs. Baxter	Dora	For a moment he felt that he stood in the presence of a saint; earthly passion seemed out of place. After a moment’s silence she seated herself, mechanically protesting that she had promised [MASK] to help her with her Sunday-school class at half-past one.
<name>Rose</name>	Rose	Dora	“ Do you like your work — is it hard ? ” asked [MASK], as she idly wandered from one object to another in the pretty room, pausing beside the desk to glance admiringly at a pile of neatly written sheets, just taken from the machine.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Providence	An’ in two seconds he was in the worst alpaca fit you ever seen. The seconds acknowledged me the victor by a reckless invention of [MASK], they bein’ aware that the adversary wasn’t hit by nary bullet, the rifles bein’ loaded with salt fer fear of mischief.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Will	And she lives in our alley. She pushed the door open and entered. Her cheeks were glowing from her walk in the bracing morning air, but her face assumed a serious, questioning look as she discovered [MASK] just finishing up his self-imposed morning task.
<name>Nature</name>	Nature	Nature	On this particular morning [MASK] outdid herself. There was a blending together of all the sweet forces — odorous air, golden sunshine, musical sounds from bird and from bush; it was pure happiness to feel the lifeblood leaping in one’s veins; to feel the marvelous joy of living.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sappho	int’rest’d ’nuff in an ole man to want to hear how I come to ’vertis myself as a magnifyin’ doctor, an’ where I picked it up, eh ? ” “Yes,” replied [MASK], “ I certainly am interested in your story.”
<name>John</name>	John	Bill	He handed [MASK] a cigar, saying, “We may as well make ourselves comfortable ”; and before the latter had fairly begun to enjoy the fragrant weed, had called for whiskey and was pressing him to help himself.
<name>Elba</name>	Elba	Charles	O mama, mama, my beautiful mama!” and with a burst of grief he cast himself upon the velvet turf. The mineralogist lost no time in completing the purchase of [MASK], and in a few days they left the town.
<name>She</name>	She	Sappho	Long she struggled with thoughts which represented to her but vaguely a life beyond anything of which she had ever dreamed. [MASK] generally carried her work home in the morning, but ten o’clock would find her seated at her desk and ready to begin her task anew.
<name>John</name>	John	Sappho	Morning had brought relief from the high winds, and the temperature had moderated somewhat; but the snow still fell steadily, drifting into huge piles, which made the streets impassable. It was the first great storm [MASK] had seen.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Sappho	His gaze was fixed upon [MASK], who was surrounded by every eligible man in the house. And such a look! love — hatred—tenderness — the gamut of passion was disclosed by the look bent upon the unconscious girl before them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sappho	I suppose you won’t want me to touch them, for fear of getting fat.” [MASK] shook her head in mock despair. “ And your teeth, your beautiful white teeth, where will they be shortly if you persist in eating a pound of bonbons every day?
<name>Everard</name>	Everard	Ever	[MASK] and anon his attention wavered, and finally he threw his books and papers to one side with a sigh, and rising to his feet paced the floor impatiently. Two soft eyes looked into his ; the low music of a gentle voice seemed all about him.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Sappho	Why should you be bothered with them ? ” “ Because, [MASK], my beautiful one, my darling, I love you — surely you know it — I have loved you from the first moment that I saw you. Be my wife, my blessing.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tennyson	— [MASK]. The next morning found the household early astir. It is a rule in hotels that a “ late watch,” as it is called, exempts the employee from an early appearance for duty the next morning.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Elizabeth	Your grandmother sat in the kitchen knitting and trying to keep the younger children in order, when to her consternation the door opened and in walked father. ‘ [MASK],’ said he, ‘ I hear a man’s voice in the parlor. What’s the trouble ? ’
<name>Electricity</name>	Electricity	Electricity	Among the trees small tables were to be set, making a charming solihide a deux. [MASK], cunningly concealed in rose-colored shades, was to furnish the lighting. Pretty girl-waiters, in white dresses and fancy caps, completed a fascinating picture.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Dora	“ This man receiveth sinners,” read [MASK] from a pamphlet on the desk, as she turned to accept the offered chair. “ I see that is your illuminated text for the day. Are you a Christian?” Then she saw an ivory crucifix sus-
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Sally	Of all the days that are in the week, I dearly love but one day. That is the day that comes between Saturday and Monday. For then I dress all in my best And roam with my dear [MASK]; She’s the darling of my heart,
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sappho	By eleven o’clock they had locked the door of [MASK]’s room to keep out all intruders, had mended the fire until the little stove gave out a delicious warmth, and had drawn the window curtains close to keep out stray currents of air.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sappho	Tonight she had sent for her, and presently the Mother glided in, with her noiseless step and gentle, assuring manner. The holy woman sat there a long time in silence after listening to [MASK]’s story. Such confidences were not new to her.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Alphonse	“ I am your mother, [MASK],” she said in answer to his looks of inquiry. “ My mamma is gone away to heaven,” replied the child solemnly, as he watched her earnestly with great dark eyes of wonder.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Lewis	Be faithful to the object of your choice, or merit the fate reserved for fickleness and deceit."’ “ Can’t blame him for feeling wrathy over such a fortune as that, can you, [MASK] ? ”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Dora	He treats me very well, too.” “ I have heard many girls tell much the same tale about other lines of business,” said [MASK]. “It makes me content to do the work of this house, and not complain.”
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	John	He pursued her unceasingly. Flowers of rare beauty and fragrance, fruit and books, found their way to her home each week. [MASK] had been rather an indifferent lover; but who could resist the impetuous onslaught of a generous nature that truly loved ?
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Willie	No one shall trouble you; you will have nothing to do with it.” “ Well, if you say so, [MASK], it’s all right,” replied his mother with a fond smile; “you are master in this house.”
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Sappho	He was a tall, aristocratic-looking man of dignified bearing, though one soon perceived that age had bent his once firm shoulders. His hair, now entirely white, added to his venerable appearance. His face was gentle and kindly, and immediately won [MASK]’s heart.
<name>He</name>	He	Dora	“ Oh, never mind me,” he returned pleasantly; “if you get such a mongrel mixture as the one sent to me, I shan’t envy you the pleasure you’ll get out of it.” “ It wasn’t pleasant, I remember. [MASK] told us about it.”
<name>jealous</name>	jealous	merried	“ Now that would be a pity, after you’ve been together so long,” remarked the latter. “ She’s got to drop sayin’ ticklish things to me. A ’ooman’s got a right to git [MASK], ain’t she ? ”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dora	[MASK] had confided to her friend every event of importance that had occurred in her young life; and, in harmless gossip, had related the history of all the friends who visited the house intimately; but all this had begot no like unburdening to eager ears of the early history of her friend.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Sappho	He was confused and uncertain in his thoughts, but when he could command himself sufficiently to reason, he felt that it was very foolish in him to wonder at [MASK]’s presence there ; all girls were eager to consult those who could unveil for them anything pertaining to the future.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sappho	I do despair of ever being like other girls.” [MASK] laughed outright at the woe-begone countenance before her. “ It is generally the other way: the men get tired of us first. A woman loves one man, and is true to him through all eternity.”
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Conscience	Then came the blessed relief of tears — like a flood — they relieved the overcharged brain and saved her reason. She fancied, as she sat there trying to account for the evil that pursued her, that [MASK] spoke in condemnation of her neglect of her child.
<name>Longfellow</name>	Longfellow	Whittier	The gray day darkened into night, . . . Made hoary with the swarm And whirl-dance of the blinding storm, As zigzag wavering to and fro, Crossed and recrossed the winged snow. — [MASK]. February drew slowly to a close.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Job	Let me know your answer then.” And turning, he left her as abruptly as he had come. CHAPTER XXI. AFTER MANY DAYS. “ The Lord blessed the latter end of [MASK] more than his beginning.” The days dragged their weary length along.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dora	One woman can never tie my wandering fancy; my heart is large enough to appreciate the charms of the fair sex wherever discovered. [MASK] don’t like it, I know, but she’ll get used to it after we are married,” he said, recklessly.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	John	Then she sank upon the floor and literally grovelled there, her face hidden by the long hair which enveloped her like a veil. [MASK] was nonplussed at the perfect success of his plot; he was exultant. The terror of the girl was awful to behold.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dora	[MASK] smiled as she caught the half-puzzled, half-wondering expression on her mother’s face. It was approaching twelve o’clock when it was proposed to wind up the festivities with the good old “Virginy” reel.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Dora	“ I’m going up stairs after the laggard, and have it out with her for keeping such news to herself. I know she’s bashful.” [MASK] sprang up the stairs with a bound, and paused outside the door to rap.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	John	[MASK] had risen early and left the house before any one was astir. He could not sleep. Up and down the deserted streets he paced, gazing at the silent stars and baring his head to the cold, refreshing breeze of the April morning.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Man	It is but a loan from the Almighty, whose existence you affect to doubt. [MASK] has no title to the property until he has permission to hold it eternally.” “ And then ? ” “He must have satisfied the Almighty that he is worthy.”
<name>Cupid</name>	Cupid	Mercury	A quaint conceit which gave great pleasure to the children, big and little, was the pretty great-nephew of the seeress who, dressed in costume, represented [MASK] and carried messages to the fortunate ones remembered by the mystic powers of Futurity.
