<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bron	“But you seemed to be enjoying yourself. Personally, I think it’s worth it.” [MASK]’s hand was on his purse, prepared to offer the ritual bill and the ritual request for a better table. But it was a' good location.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Bron	“And those great, shaggy pines you can just see off there—” ([MASK] had thought they were bushes and much closer; but, as it had been doing here and there with each blink since they’d gotten off the bus, perspective righted.)
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Lawrence	In the room, she took off all her clothes, opened out the bed, lay down on it, and collapsed into sleep— “Hello, I saw your door open and the light on so I—” [MASK], halfway through the door, stopped, frowned.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bron	“Oh do let’s sit here! It was such a lovely walk, after such a lovely ride. I can’t picture a happier destination!” [MASK] smiled, shrugged, and for the second time felt the perspiration of embarassment break on the small of his back.
<name>George</name>	George	Philip	You finish it under that, and my face will be red all over four departments. See you both around.” He slipped from the table and lumbered (neither tall nor broad, just thick, [MASK] still gave the impression of lumbering everywhere) across the cafeteria.
<name>George</name>	George	Bron	[MASK] looked out the window again. The wedge of the sun’s disk was getting higher. “ ... Oh,” he repeated, looked around the room, then got back into bed, dragging some of the covers loose from the inert body beside him.
<name>Humpty Dumpty</name>	Humpty Dumpty	Cracks	“I’m sorry about this, really, I am . . . But I just tend to anthropomorphize everything!” One of the women swung a small sledge against the wall. [MASK] zagged out from the blow. The little girl on top of the ladder burst out weeping afresh.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Philip	“Three that I remember. One with its own waterfall, splattering and splashing down from the pool upstairs. Their kids are so damned well-behaved and precocious—and a third of them so obviously [MASK]’s you wonder if they have him around for anything else.
<name>Forrest J. Ackerman</name>	Forrest J. Ackerman	Bron	But any" scientist of the period would have giggled all the way to the bar.” “S-f?” [MASK] leaned against the bar. “ ‘Scientifiction?’ ‘Sci-fi?’ ‘Speculative fiction?’ ‘Science fiction?’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bran	“You moonies are really animals, aren’t you?” Shaking his head, he slammed the door after himself. Forty minutes later, the same guard came back, alone. [MASK]’s shoulders stiffened. He pushed back against the plaster.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Wonderingiy	And don’t come in tomorrow.” [MASK], he said (he hadn’t meant it to, but it sounded a little belligerent): “Okay ..and returned to his office. He thought many confused thoughts, and didn’t even bother to open the Day Star folder again.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bron	“No, thank you ...” But her hand clapped him anyway; then she jerked it away and looked distressed: “Oh, I’m dreadfully sorry—You said ‘No’—!” “Um ... that’s all right,” [MASK] mumbled.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lawrence	The plastic Sea Serpent had been put, bobbing, into the sea. The Beast leered from its lair; [MASK]’s soldiers were set up along the river bank, his peasants in their fields, his royalty gathered behind the lines, his magicians in their caves.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Miriamne	Where do you think you are?” And he still stood, still blinking, in the half-veiled dark. Somebody else stumbled against him. And somebody else. The green slip was already in. There was nothing he could do for [MASK]...
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Bron	And in one horrifying moment, [MASK] realized he could not remember the name of that most expensive of drinks! What leapt to his mind was the name of that one, indeed, tastier, but cheaper—and by which one always rated clients
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Sam	Political commitment isn’t a perimeter, [MASK]; it’s a parameter. Don’t you ever wonder? Don’t you ever doubt?” “What great metaphysical crisis have you just been through that’s suddenly gotten all your angst up?”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Philip	“I used to say to [MASK], even before the war, that if you were only a woman, I could .. .” She laughed again. “I mean, it was a joke. But then, to come in the day after the war and find that you were a woman....
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bron	And [MASK] felt suddenly light-headed; his next heartbeat reverberated in his skull, painful as a hammer. Then, at a sudden blow to the soles of his feet, his stomach turned over—no, he didn’t vomit. But he staggered.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Sam	Broken glass; tom rubber; his own face distorted in the bent chrome slip: the image returned, intense enough to startle: “[MASK], really—why does the government want someone like me along on a trip like this?” “They don’t want you.
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Bron	“Don’t wince!” the man said. “It’s supposed to hurt.” Ridiculous as the order and explanation was, [MASK] found himself trying to obey. The man jerked the instrument away and looked at it. “Wouldn’t you know.
<name>Joker</name>	Joker	Bron	The hair showing on the right of her head was a riot of green, gold, purple, and orange. The visible half of her face was set, sullen, and preoccupied. “Hey,” [MASK] said, “were you really that bothered because I... ?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bron	[MASK] paused with his fork in a piece of the tissuey crust that had chemisee’A the boeuf. “I love you,” he said. “Throw up the theater. Join your life to mine. Become one with me. Be mine. Let me possess you wholly.”
<name>Elon</name>	Elon	Audri	To [MASK] he said: “I want to talk to you about what we tell the Day Star Plus people about Day Star Minus when I have to explain to them why no metalogical reduction yet. And soon.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Bron	Really, a logically consistent position is just beyond her— though, like you, she talks about logic enough. Really, the only reason she gives for not wanting to know you is because I happened to mention you were gay! Take a look—” [MASK] held out the crumpled letter.
<name>Hiroshima</name>	Hiroshima	Tethys	As far as they can tell, eighty-six percent of [MASK]’ population was outside within a minute and ten seconds, one way or the other, of the cut.” “What’s to doubt there?” “They were wrong.”
<name>Zebulon</name>	Zebulon	Lawrence	[MASK] assembled the astral cube: the six six-by-six plastic squares, stacked on brass stilts, made a three dimensional, transparent playing space to the right of- the main board, on which all demonic, mythical, magical, and astral battles were enacted.
<name>Spacemen</name>	Spacemen	Marsies	“It’s funny,” one of the guards said to nobody in particular. “The moonies always sit in the comer soon as you leave ’em alone. [MASK] and Earthmen always sit at the center of the wall. I’ve always wondered why.”
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Sam	But supper—?) and a silver harness (his own) rather like a Tethys e-girl’s, and the silver briefs that matched it: a black waist-pouch ([MASK]’s) for the money.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Bron	The console rolled out a final sheet from its plastic lips. “Well, what do you think?” “What do they mean?” [MASK] asked. The younger woman, with pursed lips, flipped through the other four sheets.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Sam	“I believe,” [MASK] said, “this is going to be what is known, in earthly parlance, as a scorcher—a very hot day!” “What’s the point of having the sun so hot and close if you can’t enjoy it?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Bron	He glanced back, added his own laughter again. People on the bench smiled. [MASK] tried not to look away; and failed. “Didn’t somebody advise you to stay away from places like this till after you got a little better acclimated?”
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Sam	[MASK] was saying: “Hey, there!” And, “Well!” and then: “I admit, I’m ...” Then just nodded, with approval!) and with (still) the smile. “How’ve you been, huh?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Brian	Yes, [MASK], her counselor ... It would be her third counseling session, the first op- tional one. She wished desperately that this whole depressing encounter had not taken place just then. It made the whole counseling thing seem too necessary.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Bron	the Spike whispered, picking up a pole leaning against the wall, thrust another into [MASK]’s gloves and, carrying hers high, ran out over the spread carnival, into the circle of torchbearers (who fell back for her) waving her pole over her head.
<name>you</name>	you	Philip	There’s a guy in my co-op who’s actually in the government, and on what I’m sure you would consider the wrong side, too: he probably thinks more of the malcontents than [MASK] does.”
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Lawrence	“Come on. Move!” “Well—” [MASK] stood, pulling the cape around his shoulders and frowning down where it brushed the rug—“I suppose, in time of war . . .” He pulled the hood up, frowned, then pushed it back again.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Sam	“The flickering here was our domestic emergency power coming in; and not quite making it—the generators need a couple of seconds to warm up. I would guess ...” [MASK] glanced up—“that the sensory shield will be off over die city for another three or four minutes.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Bron	Minutes later, he too was exhausted. Wrapped around each other, the arms of each straining around each other’s gasped breaths, [MASK] waited for sleep ... floated up toward it, a bit jerkily (like that inane trapeze, rising into the dark), each gasp.
<name>he</name>	he	Bron	Verbal disorientation, he thought, listening to the surreal catalogue of the lyrics: the melody was minor, this time rhythmic, more chant than song. Who ([MASK] gazed about the spectators clapping to the intense, insistent rhythm) was the audience this time?
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Sam	He found the street with the stone steps just by aoci-dent. In the backvard of the guesthouse. [MASK] sat at a white enameled table, by his elbow a tall glass of something orange with a straw in it and green leaves sticking out the top.
<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Bron	You’ve had women lovers. Love me. I’ll have a refixation, tonight I want you. I love you. I didn’t even know it, but seeing you again—” “Oh, [MASK] ...”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Bron	[MASK]’s gone quite mushy over some theatrical Woman in the u-1 and can’t get up nerve to go back and find her, which is fine by me. But it’s shot his concentration all to hell, which isn’t.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Lawrence	Or seventy percent of it, today, anyway. Not that I begrudge them what, like you say, in the last hundred and seventy-five years they’ve been given—” The vlet case slipped from [MASK]’s hands. crashed to the floor, and fell open.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Bron	[MASK] sat in his own chair across from the Spike and thought: She is totally delightful and totally upsetting. Somehow, though, the realization had crystalized: Play the client as he might, there was no way he could fit her into the role of his younger self.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Bron	I certainly had.” ([MASK] smiled. In the Satellites, children were given only a first name at birth—about half the time the last name of one of their genetic parents, government serial numbers doing for all official identification.
<name>Chuck</name>	Chuck	Bron	“Oh, perhaps an off-Thursdays—or on every second Tuesday of the month—some version of that thought flickers through my addled brain—” “Yeah.” [MASK] nodded. “You know, that’s the third time in three days someone’s called me that.”
<name>May</name>	May	Audri	(There were times his liking for [MASK] almost approached a sort of platonic love.) “I’m off. I’m off. Hey, you’ve been at your new place practically six months now. Frozen in yet?”
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Bron	But then, what was the u-1 for, if not to do things differently in? “Now you see,” [MASK] said, “that seems romantic to me, growing up in the untamed, crystalline ' wilderness.
<name>Wintermute</name>	Wintermute	Brian	“Inefficiency, like efficiency, is another interface.” [MASK] moved one hand to her lap. “Let me put it this way. You think women are different in many ‘subtle’ ways—more emotional perhaps, probably less objective, possibly more self-centered.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bron	[MASK] sighed)—“Well, downstairs, in the west wing. Yes, we do. But ...” Now he laughed. “Well, so seldom do the two departments have to work on the same case that—well, there isn’t even a door from our office to theirs.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Audri	“She should have told me.” “Well—” [MASK] took a bite of the nut bar—“it’s sent now. Besides, everything’s so messed up right through here anyway with the situation between us and the worlds, I’m surprised we’re still here at all.
<name>Mars</name>	Mars	Triton	Nobody today on [MASK] knew nor cared what it meant. Frankly, today, neither would most civilized Martians. The leather collar he’d had his design-rental house put together, with brass buckle and studs—which was just nostalgia for last year’s fashions.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Sam	“And say hello to the old pirate for me when you get home,” [MASK] called after him. “Hope you beat the fuzz off his balding pate—” On the phone (“Yes, what is it?”)
<name>Dr. Strangeways</name>	Dr. Strangeways	Bron	Not to the method bom.” [MASK] wondered how many times a day he put it exactly like that. “But I hope you’ll accept the help I can give you, if only the information about the purely biological possibilities.” The man took a breath.
<name>Spike</name>	Spike	Audri	People take care of their own feelings; I take care of mine. Besides, if I’d just said, “No,” to [MASK]’s request, it would have been far kinder than all those complicated theatrics! That was worthy of an actress like the Spike!
<name>Scarface</name>	Scarface	Bron	His face glowered: the flesh high and to the left of his nose was so scarred, swollen, and dirty, [MASK] could not tell if the sunken spot glistening within was an eye or open wound. The head shook slowly. “Okay, brother.
<name>her</name>	her	Audri	Now it seemed ridiculous, cruel (he did like [MASK]), and self-centered. If he could have, he would have kept her on now. But the green slip—“I don’t suppose she’s still ..His voice was hollowed by the dark shell.
<name>Bartleby</name>	Bartleby	Bron	And those who chose only to walk? ([MASK] saw the arched underpass in the gray wall across the alley’s end.)—those who chose to walk there only occasionally, when they felt their identity threatened by the redundant formality of the orderly, licensed world . . . ?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Bron	I wanted to get was that information about Day Star minus.” She stepped around the comer of the desk, put a folder down. “Oh, did you see that memo from the Art Department—?” which [MASK] finally found on the floor beside her desk.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Bron	Then his eyes left her face to drop down her body; and came slowly back, with a smile that was almost mocking. “[MASK] ... ?” Let there be something beside derision in his smile, she whispered- silently; her eyes closed lightly before it.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Lawrence	Wasn’t that, she told herself silently, the one thing that, from her life before, she now, honestly knew? Dinner was simple, unpretentious, and vegetarian. And, despite the soreness, with [MASK]’s gentle chatter it was pleasanter than any meal she’d had on Earth.
<name>Tabitha</name>	Tabitha	Td	“Yes.” ‘[MASK] hate to think what you’d have said if you hadn’t! You just sounded like you were agreeing to supervise your own execution—” at which point painted arms, with iridescent multihued nails, flapped around her shoulder.
<name>the therapist</name>	the therapist	Brian	What makes you think that most women feel like women every—” “But I don’t want to be like most women—” and then wished she hadn’t said it because [MASK]’s basic counseling technique was not to respond to things un-respondable to—which meant frequent silences.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bron	Both guards had been women. Three hours later the locks clashed again. As the two guards marched in, [MASK] struggled to his feet (from the spot in the center of the wall he’d fi- nally, after much pacing, chosen to sit).
<name>someone</name>	someone	Bron	“There is no majority configuration,” the younger technician said, a little drily. “We live in the same coop,” she explained to [MASK]. “Sometimes you still have to remind them, or life can get very grim.”
<name>Wendell Johnson</name>	Wendell Johnson	Carabelli	By the twenty-first century, [MASK]’s cusp had gone the way of the Neanderthal brow ridge and the three-toed hoof of eohippos. The human race no longer possesses it. The ability to fold the tongue muscles laterally as well as ventrally swept the species even faster, over the same period.
<name>they</name>	they	Bron	Some looked downright exhausted. Was that why some of the people seemed so unfamiliar? As they passed through the door into the opulent cabin, with its carpeted levels and reclining chairs, [MASK] realized that at least three people were, indeed, new.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Bron	He had a large, magnificent body which he always wore (rather pretentiously, [MASK] thought) naked. “How’ve you been going along since I left?” He came over to stand at the table’s edge and, with black fists on narrow, black hips, gazed down over the arrayed pieces.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Audri	In the cafeteria, he was sitting at a just-plain-eating booth, pinching at the folds of a half-collapsed coffee bulb, when, glancing up, he saw [MASK] with her tray. “Hi, there,” she said and slid in across from him.
<name>he</name>	he	Philip	She had recognized it before. She recognized it now. And [MASK] was still (with his hand on the shoulder and. his unstoppable frankness) the most annoying person she knew—plurality female configuration or not, she thought grimly.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	Anybody winning?” [MASK] came down the narrow, iron steps, slapping the bannister with a broad, black hand. It rang across the common room. Half a dozen men sitting about in reading cubicles, tape niches, or discussion comers looked up, smiled.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Bron	The majordomo smiled. “But I think,” [MASK] said, “it might be a bit distracting.” (She was charming ... All four? Really!) “We’ll settle for earth, air, and water; and leave fire for another time.”
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Spike	“What are you doing, [MASK]? I guess the company’s going pretty well now.” “Actually, we’re sort of in hibernation. Maybe we’ll get together again someday; but once the endowment ran out, we more or less disbanded.”
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Bron	You might, however, prefer to express it a little more flatteringly to yourself: We trust most of our citizens in this day and age not to do anything too stupid.” “Both sets of words still model the same situation,” [MASK] said.
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Lawrence	“You don’t remember where the others were supposed to go?” he asked [MASK], who was looking up between the buildings. Across the intersection rose a decorative arch, which, with all its light off, looked like two charred ribs from some incinerated carcass.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bron	Now, would he like to take advantage of it and pick up his letter before he got home? “Yes!” [MASK] said. “Thank you!” Hanging up, he turned, angrily, from the phone.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Sam	“Here I am, running my tail off to get to this Snake Pit in time, and there you two are, already frozen in!” From the balcony, [MASK] leered hugely, jovially, and blackly over the rail. “Well! What can you do?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Bron	I made it myself. How’re you freezing in?” “I’m ...” [MASK] let a breath go, felt her back muscles, that had tightened almost to a cramp, relax a little. “Well, I... guess you would understand ...”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Audri	Which is going to be pretty hard. But I guess I have to . . .” [MASK] took a breath, tightened her mouth, let the breath out slowly, then said, almost in a whisper: “Come home with me. Make love with me.
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Bron	A man in maroon coveralls backed through it. Apparently he was still talking to a bunch of friends outside. He kept lingering at the door, calling to them, laughing at them. [MASK] looked at the women. Some were definitely looking at her now.
<name>June</name>	June	Brian	[MASK] cocked her head. “I said before, you were a woman made by a man. You are also a woman made for a man. Just considering who you are, I suspect you’d be a lot happier if you got a man.
<name>he</name>	he	Philip	No, it’s nothing serious, but I just thought I better mention it before it got serious. Your efficiency index blinks a little shakily on the charts. Look, we all know you’ve had a lot to adjust to—” “Did [MASK] say something?”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Charo	“Then why does he come back?” She shrugged. “I suppose ... well, he wants to show off.” “And be scandalous?” Her lower lip inside her mouth, the Spike smiled. “[MASK] said she had a fine time.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Bron	“Sir ... ?” The majordomo raised an attendant eyebrow. “Well . . .” [MASK] mused. “I don’t know. . . .” “Oh do let’s sit here! It was such a lovely walk, after such a lovely ride.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Audri	“We don’t have to get hysterical yet, I suppose,” [MASK] said. “It’s only eight percent—this time. And just for two weeks. They want to make everything look like its working at full capacity, only that people just all happen to be off doing something else.”
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Bron	Then the wind’s roar wedged between them and him; the bench shook above him. One end swung loose. And [MASK] stood; and ran. The gale growing on his left changed his course, in half a dozen steps, nearly ninety degrees, then sent him sprawling to his knees and palms.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Bron	Back in her office cubicle, [MASK] had pondered. Once or twice she had consciously thought that she must be ready for her work to mean less to her than before; but that was supposed to happen only at the materialization of the proper man—though nothing like that man had come anywhere near materializing.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Bron	[MASK] felt the third drop of sweat pause, halfway down her back, then roll on. At the comer she thought: Where am I ... ? Where— Involved in her explanation, she hadn’t noticed the street they had turned on.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Audri	It’s just that I feel—Oh, look, I’ve already said much too much about it already. Any more, and I’ll just feel like the complete fool I am—” “Oh, no . . .” [MASK] said.
<name>men</name>	men	Bron	she’d moved out of!), sex was the only explanation. All but the first of each [MASK] had refused. There’d been no pass; the woman had moved. The contemplated subterfuge had been forgotten.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Bron	They’re gonna have it in tomorrow— only tomorrow I have to start these vocational aptitude tests. My social worker says I have to—You pick it up for me, [MASK]. The shop’s on the southeast corner—not the big one.
<name>Colonel</name>	Colonel	Lawrence	I mean it was really your idea to—■” [MASK] sat back; pale, wrinkled hands dragged against dark, wrinkled genitals. “You’re a fool! You’re a fool! You’re a fool! You’re going to talk to me about bravery?”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Bron	Or looking past her? [MASK] turned, thinking how silly it was to be in a pickup bar with nothing but women. But the door was opening. A man in maroon coveralls backed through it. Apparently he was still talking to a bunch of friends outside.
<name>him</name>	him	Bron	The man opened the door, left; the guards followed. The one who had hit him paused, a hand on the door edge, and frowned at what time and fear and the pain in his gut had forced [MASK] to leave on the floor by the comer drain.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Miriamne	There was a reader beside the bed, but nothing like a file drawer for a library. (Which was also, he reflected, very u-1. The books, of course, would all be poetry.) “We don’t have many visitors,” [MASK] explained.
<name>the Joker</name>	the Joker	Sam	Here and there was the sound of faint laughter, or faint converse. Most, however, were silent. “Around and around and around we go,” [MASK] said, and added his soft bass rumble to the drifting voices.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Sam	Still, again, she had been about to sacrifice all her ideals, her entire plan, just for an . .. emotional whim! Yet, while it had been happening, it had seemed those ideals were just what she had been pursuing ... [MASK]?
<name>Mélisande</name>	Mélisande	Smoothly	[MASK]. On one forearm, she wore a silvery gauntlet, damasked with intricate symbols. As he approached, she stood up, held out her hands. Left arm a-dangle with silver, he took her hands in his, and chuckled.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Charo	And, [MASK] aside, she had made it clear her lesbian leanings were rather intellectual. He said: “Fd be interested to know what you thought of Earth audiences now that you’ve had another performance.” “Well, I . . .”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Bron	“Do you see,” [MASK] said, “I just couldn’t say yes to you, not when I’m still involved with her, in all this nonsense— and I am, I am, up to my ears.”
