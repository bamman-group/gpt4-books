<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Harry	I couldn’t believe it. He comes on to me like there was no way I could touch him.” "It made you mad,” [MASK] said. “The more I thought about it, yeah. At the time, it surprised me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Harry	[MASK] said just great. The way he always did, sitting on the other side of this desk times before, here to ask for investment money—oh, everything was just great— though he did happen to have a few points left over if they wanted in.
<name>Salinger</name>	Salinger	Chili	"What did you think of him?” [MASK] said he thought he was basically a nice guy, but it was hard to tell. "He was on most of the time. I think he has trouble being just himself.” "He do any imitations?"
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Harry	[MASK] dreaming of a twenty-million-plus production he’d never get off the ground. And a star he’d never sign. With or without her help. She might ask him, "Remember I told you last night about a picture I’ve been offered?”
<name>Marv</name>	Marv	Chili	You want me to do something for you, right?” Here was a man had made forty-nine movies and named a bunch of them earlier, when he was making coffee. [MASK] remembered having seen quite a few.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chili	"Anywhere along here’s fine,” [MASK] said, thinking of times he had been asked if he was guilty and not once ever having the urge to say he was. Real-life situations, even facing prison time, were never as emotional as movies.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Bones	"This place’s all freeways, you can drive around forever and never leave town. How’d you get in here?” "I told them at the desk I was you,” [MASK] said. "I acted stupid and they believed me.”
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Tommy	Now it sounded like [MASK] was stopped. “What’re you talking about? You wanta be a movie star?” "I’m no actor. I’m talking about producing.” "How you gonna do that? You don’t know shit about making movies.”
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Nicki	They’d start a number, race into it and stop and [MASK] would play part of it over on her bull’s-eye guitar, slower, smoother, and then one of the guitar players would pick it up, imitating, give a nod and the drummer would kick them off again.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Chili	[MASK] got ready to say well, maybe he’d be seeing her sometime, when she looked up at him again. “I probably would’ve taken it though. But during the meeting I got into what we were talking about this morning, my feeling guilty?
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Leo	[MASK]’s the victim, but we don’t give a shit about him either. You don’t have a good guy, you don't have a girl in it, a female lead . . . you have a first act, you’re partway into the second.”
<name>Max</name>	Max	Elaine	Any of the guys you mentioned, what’s a rewrite gonna cost me?" [MASK]: "Depending on who you get, I would say anywhere from one-fifty to four, and a few points. Call their agents, see who’s available and might want to do it.”
<name>her</name>	her	Harry	He didn’t ask himself why she wanted to go to bed with him. It never entered his mind. "So who paid, you or [MASK]?” "I did.” "You felt sorry for him.” “Well, yeah, maybe.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Chili	[MASK] was coming past the ones at the top of the stairs. She heard him say, “I guess the guy fell.” Now he was looking at her. He came over and she said, "What did he do to you?”
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Chili	"But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can’t.” Looking at [MASK] the whole time. "Can they?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Harry	He still couldn’t understand how [MASK] missed seeing the guy was colored. He was light-skinned and his hair was fairly straight, combed over to one side, but that didn’t mean anything. The color itself didn’t mean anything either.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lovejoy	"Basically, yeah, except what I mentioned. The part I read, the ending, I didn’t like ’cause it’s a letdown. You know what I mean? [MASK]’s just standing there.” "What do you think he should do?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Harry	"The patio door was open.” “Yeah? Was there a sign on it, ‘Come on in’? [MASK], you walk in where you don’t belong it’s breaking and entering, whether you have to break in or not.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chili	What [MASK] had in 325 was a two-hundred-buck suite with windows facing apartment balconies about fifty feet away; but that was okay, he wouldn’t be looking out much. There was a phone in the bedroom, another one on the counter separating the living room from the kitchenette.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Chili	"I mean even before I find out you don’t know how it ends. There’s nobody to sympathize with. Who’s the good guy? You don’t have one.” [MASK] said, "The shylock’s the good guy.” Sounding surprised.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	“You’re not looking at me, [MASK].” “Why do I have to keep looking at you?” "I want you to.” "You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?”
<name>Raymond</name>	Raymond	Catlett	"You don’t care for the ending,” [MASK] said, "and I don't like the middle part. I’m thinking what we could do is fix it. You hear what I’m saying? Get some heat in it.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Harry	“I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor,” [MASK] said. "You know what could’ve happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.” “I don’t have a dog.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chili	[MASK] paused. “It was C . . . either sixteen or seventeen. He said, “Can I ask you—are you looking for a bomb? Something like that?” "Something shouldn’t be there,” the black guy said.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Karen	"It’s not bad, so far.” He motioned with his glass. “Tell [MASK], let’s see what she thinks.” "You want me to start over?” "Yeah, start over.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lovejoy	[MASK] in the van, glancing at mirror apprehensively. EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT Quiet, little traffic, then none. Until suddenly the van comes around the corner and ducks into an alley. We see the rear lights go off.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Annette	“I’ve seen movie stars right at the next table.” "You have? Like who?” [MASK] said, “Let’s see,” and thought about it staring at the clothes going by. She pressed the button to stop the conveyor.
<name>He</name>	He	Harry	Which you can't say about most film investors, the ones that want to be in show biz, get to meet movie stars and they find out, Christ, it’s a high-risk business.” [MASK] was easing into it, watching his step.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Chili	"Well, different in that the way you speak is based on an attitude,” the movie star said, leaning in with an elbow on the table and running his hand through his hair. [MASK] could see him doing it on the screen, acting natural.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Chil	“Around there, thirty-four.” "This one’s twenty-seven.” “Hey, [MASK], it’s the same broad, take my word.” "What’s the name of the group?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chili	[MASK] had no doubt it was there or this wouldn’t be a setup. The suits grab you with something incriminating, with what they called "suspected drug money,” or there could be more than cash in the locker, some dope, to make the bust stick.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bones	He looked over his shoulder to see [MASK] pulling his suitcoat from the back of the chair at the counter. "Why would I do that?” " ’Cause the guy’s my customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	There was a silence. "I don't get it.” "What?” "This guy—what’re you doing?” "He’s got some ideas, gonna help me out.” "[MASK], the guy’s a crook.”
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Lovejoy	The guy telling him now, “I started reading, I couldn’t put it down. I’m at the part—let’s see, about fifteen pages to go—[MASK]’s coming out of court with his sister, can’t believe what’s happened to him.’’
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Bones	[MASK] paused. He said, "Look, there’s no reason why you and I shouldn’t get along. Forget all the bullshit going back to that time—I don’t even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin thing, whatever it was—forget it.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Harry	He said, “If you’re gonna sleep in and I have to sit around waiting, forget it. Anything I can’t stand is waiting for people.’’ [MASK] acted surprised. He said it was only ten after ten.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Nicki	He didn’t see [MASK] anywhere, just these four skinny guys, typical rock-and-roll assholes with all the hair, bare arms tricked out with tattoos and metal bracelets, all of them with that typical bored way they had.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chili	He was wearing it, you know, to go home. He wasn’t gonna keep it.” "My car keys are in the pocket,” [MASK] said. They both looked at him now, the manager and the waiter, like they didn’t understand English.
<name>She</name>	She	Elaine	You know, like I’m an idiot. It really pissed me off. I said well, if that’s the way you want to do it, I’ll see you.” "They try to talk you into it?” "[MASK] did, in a way.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Harry	"I had to tell ’em something.” “What’d we talk about, [MASK], before? The way to handle it, you weren’t gonna tell ’em shit. Isn’t that right?” “It didn’t work out that way.”
<name>Clay</name>	Clay	Michael	“She’s a rock-and-roll singer.” He thought a moment and said, "She doesn’t shave under her arms.” "[MASK] probably goes for that. He thinks he’s earthy.” "You still like him?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Michael	We have to take the broad?’ Which is out of the question. I said, ‘What if there’s no communication between she and [MASK]? What’s she made, three pictures?’ One did okay, the other two barely earned back negative costs.”
<name>Al</name>	Al	Harry	[MASK] said, "Where?” jumping on it, twisting around in that tight space between the seat and the steering wheel. "What’s the difference where? I took the money off him and sent it to his wife.” "You didn't.”
<name>Pepe</name>	Pepe	Miguel	The Mexican was saying something. “What?” "I ask you want a drink.” "Do I want a drink—I thought you were the gardener.” "The houseman, [MASK]. I do outside, inside, everything.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chili	[MASK] moved his shoulders. The deep-set eyes didn’t change. "You gonna pay him?” "Maybe, when I get around to it.” "What if he comes looking for you?” "It’s possible.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chili	"That’s not bad.” "This’s what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.” "I believe it,” [MASK] said. "I turn it on when I confront the guy.” "Yeah, but you haven’t found him yet.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Murray	I paid [MASK] five hundred against twenty-five thousand if I exercise the option, then another twenty-five at the start of principal photography.” “That doesn’t sound like much.” “It’s an old script, been shopped around.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Karen	"Because you want it to be the wind and not that fucking maniac up there. It may sound stupid, but what it does, it gives the audience a chance to release nervous laughter.” "At my expense,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Guy	[MASK] must be loaded, drop that much and not worry about it.” "His philosophy is you win some, lose some.” "I guess that’s as good a way to look at it as any.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Chili	[MASK] said, "Yeah?” even though for some reason he wasn’t surprised. "He say what he wanted?” "He left a number.” “I’ll call him in the morning.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Beth	I did get married but the guy, the father, took off right after. So for the next twenty years I devoted my life to raising [MASK], working my tail off—but that’s all in the back story, it’s referred to.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chili	This town loves rumors, everybody knows everything, just ask them. My investors have been trying to find me for two months? I spoke to them, it wasn’t more than two weeks ago.” [MASK] said, “You mention the Piston-Lakers game?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Chili	He didn’t look too bad in the pictures. It got [MASK] thinking about them in bed together. It didn’t make sense. There was no way, with her looks, she could be that hard up. This morning when he walked in the kitchen . . .
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Beth	It’s more . . . what right do I have to be happy when my daughter’s miserable?” "You know the kid’s faking?” "It’s not that simple. You have to read it, see the way [MASK] works on me.”
<name>Donnie</name>	Donnie	Chili	[MASK] said, “Yeah? . . .” “These guys already know movie stars, celebrities; they run a limo service. So they come in on another participa- tion deal—this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Michael	She looked off toward the bandstand. "Listen, I have to go. But when [MASK] comes, I’ll introduce you.” "Yeah, I wouldn’t mind talking to him, he has time.” "You want him to do a movie?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Harry	See if there’s a gray ’83 Mercedes around with zigzag on the license plate.” "So you walked in. What if all the doors were locked?” "I would’ve rung the bell.” "Hey, it’s okay,” [MASK] said.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chili	"Why don’t I strip-search him?” "Pat him down,” the black guy said. [MASK] was starting to like the black guy, his quiet way, but couldn’t say as much for the other one.
<name>Devon</name>	Devon	Yayo	He did?” “Man wouldn’t shut his mouth.” “Listen to me,” [MASK] said. "I wan’ to leave this place, go home. Wha’ you have to do, get the money and give it to me.
<name>Virgil</name>	Virgil	Yahoo	He said, "Try to be cool, [MASK],” turning to pick up the ticket envelope and attache case. “I was to hand you this fulla money we’d be speed-cuffed before we saw it happen. Do it how I told you and have a safe trip home.
<name>Fincher</name>	Fincher	Chili	"I think he was talking mostly,” [MASK] said, "about the visual fabric of the movie and the theme, what you’re doing here, so it doesn’t start to look like something else.”
<name>Chili</name>	Chili	Harry	I’ll tell you how you can put your hands on a hundred and seventy thousand and you won’t have to give me any points or pay interest on it. You pay me back at your convenience. How’s that sound?” “You serious?” [MASK] said.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Harry	That’s the name of the movie she’s gonna be in.” [MASK] gave him a quick glance. Looking at the road again he said, "I’ll bet you a hundred bucks she doesn’t get the part.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Michael	"It was a fashionable way to pose,” [MASK] said. "And that’s what I’m talking about. There’s the pose of the character, as most people see him, and there’s the real person who laughs and cries and makes love.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Michael	You know, at least offered. No—see you tomorrow at the meeting. Now I either have to make up something quick or forget the whole thing. Or let him do it. [MASK] knows more about it than I do anyway.
<name>Stang</name>	Stang	Harry	Anyway it’s this human side that my grenadiers sense, the reason they love me, not the historic figure, and are willing to die for me.” “Sure,” [MASK] said, "you bring out that human side you’ve got the audience empathizing with you.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Harry	A lot.” [MASK] moved down the curved staircase in his shirt and boxer shorts, the monotone sound of voices becoming more distinct; he could hear words now and what sounded like audience response, the volume turned up to be heard on the second floor.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Harry	So what did the health nut do? Immediately dove into the bread basket and started eating rolls thick with butter, getting crumbs in his beard and all over the table in front of him. Now [MASK], watching him, grabbed a roll for himself before they were gone.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Chili	The guy misses, he knows what’s gonna happen.” “How about this?” the movie star said, giving [MASK] a nice dead-eyed look. "That’s not bad.” "This’s what I think of you, asshole.
<name>Suttree</name>	Suttree	Catlett	[MASK] watched the Bear get to his feet, the size of him rising up in that shirt full of flowers. "You haven’t asked did I get in the woman's house without you helping me. Did I do what I went in there for.”
<name>Mia</name>	Mia	Karen	But, she still has that actor mentality. [MASK] would have to feel the situation. First, she has to want to do it as a favor to me . . .” "For putting her in your movies.” “Yeah, and she lived with me too.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Chili	It got him hunched over the table. "You’re related to her. Wait—you’re her brother.” [MASK] shook his head, not giving him any help. "But you’re a close friend. She asked you to help her find her husband.”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Harry	[MASK] said, "Well, you take my investors, if you want to get technical,” tapping the cigarette on the table, fooling with it, “or any investors. You don’t ask where their money comes from.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Catlett	So [MASK] reset his gold-frame sunglasses and went at him again saying, “The man robs you and you tell me you don’t know what he is? If he managed to get his hands on the hundred and seventy thousand and took ofF with it . . .
<name>John</name>	John	Chili	A male voice came on saying, "Who’s speaking, please?” “I can’t tell you,” [MASK] said, “it’s an anonymous call.” The male voice said, "Are you the same anonymous asshole called last night?”
<name>me</name>	me	Leo	"Not that I heard. Why?” "Only that he was gonna come looking for me?" “That’s what he said.” “He didn’t tell you anything, I mean about [MASK]?” “Like what?”
<name>Pat</name>	Pat	Karen	" ‘And bring me a glass of milk, please, and some cookies?’ ’’ "Warm milk,” [MASK] said, "with a half ounce of Scotch in it. Did you look at the script?” "Never saw it before.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Yayo	The way it was set up, [MASK] would have his ticket envelope in his hand, the envelope with a baggage claim check stapled inside. He’d lay the envelope on the trash container right there, not stick it down in, and keep coming.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	Okay, I come to L.A., try your apartment, your office, you’re not anywhere around. So I contact some people I know of, get a few leads—” “What people?" "You have high blood pressure, [MASK]?
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Karen	From the doorway he said to [MASK], "Why chew make me do thees?" "Because I’m a girl,” the pale figure on the bed answered, "and you’re bigger than I am. A lot.”
<name>After</name>	After	Michael	"You felt sorry for him.” “Well, yeah, maybe. Twice in one day I have to explain something where he’s already made up his mind I’m trying to stick him. [MASK] left, we sat there another hour and talked.
<name>Palmer</name>	Palmer	Harry	You went in the hole on some kind of deal, so you tried to bet your way out. See, I don’t know anything about your business, [MASK], but I know how a guy acts when he's facing a payment he has to make
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Roxy	“So the cops pick up [MASK], he says he didn't know he hit anybody. It’s the next day, so there’s no way to tell he was drinking, but they have evidence, find some blood on his car matches up . . .
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Karen	He thanked her, started to get out and said, “What happens, the kid goes after your boyfriend and that’s when you finally stand up to her?” "You’re close,” [MASK] said.
<name>Chili</name>	Chili	Karen	What happens next, at the airport, is offstage. But if it did play as a scene you wouldn’t be in it.” "You mean the shylock.” [MASK] said, "Yeah, right,” thinking of something else.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Leo	For a second there [MASK] looked surprised. "I didn’t know where else to keep it. Where would you?” The guy was serious. "You’re here a while, what’s wrong with a bank?”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Harry	So he gets off the plane, goes in the cocktail lounge and starts throwing ’em down, one after the other. He’s in there when the plane takes off . . .” "Without him,” [MASK] said.
<name>Ricky</name>	Ricky	Harry	So6n as I presented you with the key to the locker it was the same as giving you the money. So you the one he ripped off, huh?” [MASK] was looking at him with a frown turning all of a sudden from worried to mean.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Annette	"What about your pants?” "I got other pants. Come on, let’s do it.” "Gee, I’d like to,” [MASK] said, "but I have to get cleaned up and meet my fella.
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Karen	He sat with his arms resting on the table, looking past his shoulder now at [MASK] in the doorway, the hall behind her dark. She looked smaller in real life than in movies, about five-two and no more than ninety-nine pounds.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Nicki	He said, "I guess we’re taking off. It was nice talking to you.” "You have to go, huh?” “[MASK]’s waiting. We’re going to duck out . . .”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Chili	“No, you broke his fuckin nose instead.” Talking about something that had happened twelve years ago, still hanging over him. "The guy only has room in his brain for one thing,” [MASK] said, “that’s the problem, he’s a fuckin idiot.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Harry	. tired of it, saying mean things and arguing by that time, picking at dumb lines that had never bothered her before. Like the one [MASK] threw at her in bed, out of nowhere . . . "Maybe it’s only the wind.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Leo	[MASK] narrowed his eyes and stared, trying hard to fake who he was. He raised his preshaped plaid hat and recocked it, see if that would help. No, there was nothing dumber than a dumb guy who thought he was a hotshot.
<name>He</name>	He	Murray	Only now he can’t get any TV work ’cause he’s around my age and the networks don’t like to hire any writers over forty. [MASK] has kind of a drinking problem, too, that doesn’t help. Likes the sauce, smokes four packs a day . . .
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Catlett	[MASK] went up to the door and rang the bell, set his sunglasses on straight, smoothed down his double-breasted navy blazer he wore with a white cotton shirt open wide at the throat and cream-colored pants.
<name>Easy</name>	Easy	Catlett	Like that.” “I wonder,” [MASK] said, "would that work. Man, it would simplify dealing with movie stars. They get temper’mental on you, lay the piece alongside their head. ‘Get back to work, motherfucker.'
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Harry	She liked it a lot better than thinking someone had broken in and was still in the house. [MASK] talking to himself made sense. Until his voice, raised, came out of the study again. “You heard me. ’’
<name>He</name>	He	Harry	Meaning the people he wanted to get out from under, his investors, the undesirables. [MASK] trying to convince himself there was no problem. What people? As if to say, What, those guys? Seeing if he could make the mess he was in seem trivial.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Karen	“You haven’t answered my question.” “Which one?” “You want to get back into it, don’t you?” “I’m thinking about it,” [MASK] said. "I'll let you know.”
