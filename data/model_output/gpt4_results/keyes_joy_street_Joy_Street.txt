<name>Emily</name>	Emily	David	But there was no more crying; there were not even any complaints.” “[MASK], how did you know all this?” “One of those children is now my adopted brother. My stepfather never had a child of his own.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	David	He hated him. And that was puerile and senseless. [MASK] had done the right thing at the right time, just as he always did. The right thing? The kind of thing that got him ahead. . . .
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Roger	She was also giving blood to the Red Cross, with the feeling that this was another small service performed in [MASK]’s behalf as well, for his failure to prove acceptable as a blood donor had been among his many disappointments.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Roger	“Didn’t it occur to you that something of the sort might happen sooner or later—as a result of the rest?” “Of course not. I thought we were just friends. I thought you were [MASK]’s friend.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Emily	She was speaking scornfully now and, once more, she made a slight movement, as if she were about to leave him. Again the swiftness and sincerity with which he spoke deterred her. “I want you to get this absolutely straight, [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eleanor	I don’t suppose you will ever learn, [MASK], that there is such a thing as expediency. Or that people who are really important are not afraid to invite anyone they please to their houses. It’s only people who are socially insecure themselves who worry about things like that.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pell	For the first time in her life, she’s meeting lots of nice girls her own age, with interests similar to hers. It’s been a revelation to her. . . . [MASK] doesn’t know yet that her mother was so cruel to her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	And even those glimpses mean a lot to the outsiders.” “[MASK]’s always understood that. She spoke of it the night she first saw you—the night she and I got engaged.” “She did? Well, I should have known she might.
<name>Penelope</name>	Penelope	Emily	CHAPTER 15 Afterward, [MASK] said several times that it was almost worth while to quarrel, because, unless you quarreled, you could not make up, and making up was undoubtedly among the most wonderful things that it was possible to do.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Emily	You knew that when you married him. You still know it. He’s your kind. He’s worth ten of me. . .. And that’s all I wanted to tell you before I went away. Good-by, [MASK].”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	A little whisky dribbled down her chin and he wiped it off with a handkerchief which he had also whipped out of hiding, so quickly that no one else saw what had happened and further embarrassment was not added to [MASK]’s pain.
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	Emily	Now quite a number of people know it.” “Then the more successful you are, the more of this sort of thing we’ve got to expect?” “I’m afraid so. But you wanted me to be a success, didn’t you, [MASK]?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	I hope it won’t bore you.” “Of course it won’t bore me. But I don’t want you to think that either [MASK] or I meant to force your confidence or pry into your affairs. You don’t owe us any explanation.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Simonetta	Perhaps you’ll talk to her about all this after I’ve left tonight, and then, later on, the four of us can discuss it together. ... I’d like to know [MASK] had a better place to live in too.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	I’d still say, [MASK]’s more than a match for her when it comes to that, and in a good many other ways too. What she’s done today hasn’t been easy. I ought to know.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	David	If we had a son, this is the way she would act toward him. She wouldn’t act this way toward [MASK], if he were her husband. She wouldn’t need to. He wouldn’t come home, half dead, hours later than she expected him.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Emily	The silver was put in the bank, 523 the rugs in storage, and the furniture was slip-covered with clean, colorless linen. [MASK] went through the premises, the night before she left, to make sure everything was in complete order.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Desmond	As for [MASK], he could buy the old bank, any time he wanted; he’s been the power behind the scenes in local politics ever since any of us can remember.” “That’s fine and I’m glad to hear it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	He glanced toward [MASK], awaiting her corroboration of his move toward departure. She looked up from the will, which she had continued to hold, but she did not return it to him, or rise. “Just a minute,” she said almost pleadingly.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	David	“You’d better sleep on this, [MASK].” “I would, ordinarily. But this doesn’t look to me like an ordinary situation. And it isn’t as if I didn’t know the rest of the boys would take care of things all right.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Caroline	“And your singing was marvelous. I remember it all perfectly.” “Well then, you ido not need to keep searching your memory or to be perplexed any longer. The puzzle is solved.” He smiled and half turned toward [MASK] on his other side.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roger	According to rumor, the last Protestant minister who officiated there hanged himself in the bell tower—perhaps in despair over the papist invasion.” “[MASK], how on earth did you find out all these things? I’m glad I didn’t make any more bets with you.”
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Roger	I keep having to remind you that I first met him through [MASK]. But I’ve seen hardly anything of him lately. And I’ve missed him a lot. If he went off in the country like that, with us, we could be together all day and every evening.”
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Emily	“I know. ‘Les bons comptes jont les bons amis.’ Well, we’ll let it go at that. Here are the keys back. You and [MASK] can go to see the house before tomorrow night, can’t you?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Roger	What’s got into you?” “As if you didn’t know! And realize that everyone else in these here parts must know by now. Why, the grapevine’s been so busy it’s had to put out new tendrils!” [MASK] laughed again.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	David	It isn’t designed for a permanent setup.” “Yes, but the point is, I told [MASK] he couldn’t go and he defied me.” “What do you mean, he defied you?” “He said he was going whether I gave my consent or not.
<name>he</name>	he	Roger	A solitary pedestrian who plodded along, neither singing nor blowing a horn nor jingling bells, looked strangely out of place among the merrymakers; more than once, [MASK] felt that he was the butt of some jeering comment as he forged past a boisterous group.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	“Do I really have to wait until next fall for an invitation? I thought maybe you’d ask me down for Thanksgiving dinner this year and let me help make the cranberry sauce.” • Well, that combination at least was working out better than [MASK] had even dared to hope.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	David	cerned. And she’s young, she’ll get over it. She has any number of other suitors—one of them would do for her just as well as [MASK]. But no one else will ever do for you.”
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Roger	As she spoke, she cast a resentful glance at the offending object which lay beside the hall table. [MASK] laughed. “It is important enough. My dear, allow me to tell you that you are now gazing on that priceless Oriental for the last time.”
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Emily	To her intense chagrin, [MASK] blushed as she spoke. Her grandmother, observing her critically, realized that the girl’s annoyance over the failure of a dinner party did not wholly account for her perturbed state of mind; she was acutely disappointed because there was, as yet, no prospect of a child.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Fopiano	“So I am told.” “By your family?” “Yes.” [MASK] apparently felt the time had come for self-assertion. “My brother is beginning to ask questions which can be answered only through hearsay,” he objected.
<name>she</name>	she	Simonetta	It would be easy enough to find out more about him, if you’re really interested. Of course [MASK] hears from him all the time, and I see her quite frequently. I think she’d be glad to talk about him, if I inquired.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Emily	The babies in the perambulators, wheeled by smartly caped nurses, were so bundled up that only the tips of their noses were visible between their woolly bonnets and their knitted blankets; and the nurses began to have a chapped, chilled look which their prim headdresses accentuated. Chilled herself, [MASK] abandoned the Garden.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Emily	You haven’t a brother or even a cousin, of draft age. No one you care about will be in danger—” She stopped suddenly. [MASK] had turned swiftly and gone back to the window again. But not before her grandmother had caught a glimpse of her face. . . .
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Eleanor	“But you didn’t. I spent them myself this morning.” “You spent them yourself this morning!’’ The tones in which [MASK] echoed her husband were as horror stricken as his had been a moment earlier. “Why, you couldn’t have!
<name>now</name>	now	Dave	I don’t suppose he really would have asked me whether I was pleased with it if I hadn’t mentioned it first, but still I had a queer feeling that he might.” “All right, that’ll do for [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	David	But there was certainly something about her. Perhaps it was partly her expression. . . . When she raised her head to receive [MASK]’s kiss, after the ceremony was over, the look in her eyes had a dazzling quality.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	David	“It’s nice, isn’t it, that [MASK] should be so fond of his stepfather? I didn’t think people were, usually. And it’s nice, too, that his mother should be so happy in her second marriage.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Irv	“Well, I called him on the phone at the Lobster House —that is, I called their number and asked for him, see, and he comes on and I say, ‘Is that you, [MASK]?’ and he says, ‘Yes,’
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Archie	[MASK] was a precocious, noisy little boy, unusually knowing and active for his age. He tore from one end of the house to the other, from one end of the lawn and garden to the other; unless he were carefully watched, he darted across the road.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Stanley	There’s no use counting on [MASK] for anything special—he’ll have to keep on doing errands. And we’ll have to take in another junior, if we can find one. But don’t let’s try to settle anything else at this hour.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	David	It appeared that there were, after all, a number of persons to whom she mattered and who mattered to her; in the preoccupation of her thoughts which were centered on [MASK] and in the companionship with her grandmother, she had underestimated the importance of 604 these other persons in her life.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Liz	Honestly, [MASK], you don’t look a day over twenty-five at this moment.” “Well, I am a day over twenty-five—a good many days. It must be the happiness you were talking about that makes me look younger.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Roger	“I’m sorry, officer. This gentleman seems to be under the impression that I know how to sing. I’m trying to convince him that I don’t.” As he spoke, [MASK] made a quiet but determined effort to free himself.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Elizabeth	Though she hoped to overcome her aunt’s hesitation, she respected it; she appreciated the symmetry of the rooms’ proportions and she knew how much time and thought had gone into their decoration. [MASK] had furnished each one differently, but in such a way that they all harmonized with each other.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Edgerly	Looking at his file, he persisted in his efforts to break down [MASK]’s testimony. “Isn’t it a fact, on the Monday after the Fourth of July, he called you up and said he’d been getting complaints from his customers that they’d been sick?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Elizabeth	“Yes, it is. . . . Well, I don’t know [MASK]’s plans, but I can ask. When would you want to go?” “Next Thursday.” “You seem to have this pretty well thought out already.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Pell	But there are lots of different Bostons, as [MASK] reminded me the other night. Not that I should have needed the reminder— that was one of the things you and I were going to do, wasn’t it? Try to get to know the other kinds better.
<name>Horace</name>	Horace	Nathaniel	When he told her about the gift from his Uncle [MASK], which would make their European honeymoon possible, the intensity of his pleasure was so evident that she tardily realized how greatly he had missed the advantages which she had taken for granted.
<name>she</name>	she	Emily	As he was lifting the latch, he turned, and [MASK] knew that if she had held out her arms to him then, he would have come back, that he would not have been able to help it. But instead of holding out her arms, she bowed her head.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Roger	“[MASK], you’re making this up.” “Just wait until we get down there; you’ll And out whether I’m making it up or not. I bet a man will be right there, flag and all.” “I’ll take you up on it.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roger	Ordinarily, she did not wear many ornaments; but now she unlocked her jewel box and studied its contents with care. The pendant of seed pearls which had belonged to [MASK]’s mother would look well with the green dress; but naturally, she did not want to wear that.
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Simonetta	He had already told her about the course at the Conservatory, so that [MASK] would not have to bear the first brunt of her displeasure over that, and he had tried to pave the way for her acceptance of other changes, such as the move from the flat.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pell	She withdrew more and more from her friends, she grew silent and morose in her sorrow and her need. But she never failed in kindness to me. And finally, spring came. And, with the spring, the beautiful baby.” Again [MASK] paused, smiling reminiscently.
<name>She</name>	She	Simonetta	And he thought [MASK] turned back for a moment, and said she was going downstairs to play for him, and that the doors would be left open, so that he could hear her. At all events, afterward he did hear music and it was very beautiful.
<name>Mrs. Slade</name>	Mrs. Slade	Grandmamma	“If [MASK] heard you talking like this, she’d just about die.” “Oh, no, she wouldn’t! It’s exactly the sort of thing she says herself. Only she doesn’t say it about the provisional Junior Leaguers of this year.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Emily	But before he could find words to frame it, [MASK] proceeded to upset him still further. “Besides, I wasn’t just listening to the carolers and looking at the lighted windows and the stars,” she went on, courage coming to her as she spoke.
<name>John</name>	John	Roger	You’d be ever so much more lovable if you did.” ‘‘More lovable! What makes you think I want to be more lovable?” “Don’t you?” “No. [MASK] loves me very much, just the way I am.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Roger	If she weren’t wicked, she wouldn’t try to stop me from getting what’s lawfully mine.” His tone had become more and more indignant as he went on. [MASK] tried to speak soothingly. “I don’t blame you for feeling the way you do.
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Roger	Long after she had at last gone to sleep, [MASK] lay wakeful and wretched beside her, dwelling on this new revelation. He had grown up in the belief that in his marital relations a gentleman was always “considerate” and he had scrupulously lived up to his code.
<name>Patricia</name>	Patricia	Emily	“I’m rather sorry you did that, [MASK]. I thought your grandmother was so wise in deciding that the Christmas gathering this year should be limited to a family group —a family group and a poor lonely bachelor like myself who happens to be a close friend.
<name>Mildred</name>	Mildred	Emily	Evidently his wife—and his servants—did not care what time dinner was served. This was quite true. [MASK]’s attitude throughout this period was sympathetic, understanding and helpful; and, to a remarkable degree, she had the co-operation of her household staff.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Grandmamma	and I don’t think [MASK] ever asked him here. Isn’t he—doesn’t he—” “Yes. He’s a little on the thirsty side. But he is a wonderful horseman. And of course, very, very social register.
<name>Rosa</name>	Rosa	Deirdre	I haven’t been in the house since I left it, but I have my keys in my purse and I’m sure there’s still something in the wine closet. [MASK] comes in to clean, so I told her to keep the small refrigerator going.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pearson	Naturally he will ring the doorbell when he arrives and naturally [MASK] will let him in, if your grandmother has invited him to come here this evening.” “She didn’t. But she said I might. I asked her if I couldn’t.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Emily	I must tell my stepfather I’ve seen it. He’ll be terribly jealous of me.” “Is your stepfather especially interested in such things?” [MASK] inquired, offering the scones. “Well, he’s an antique dealer, catering to the luxury trade.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Briny	I suppose it’s part of the game to do mud-slinging in public. But [MASK]’s a very good friend of mine. He’s not coming to the house just now because he realizes it would create a certain awkwardness if he did. I realize that too.
<name>Mrs. Slade</name>	Mrs. Slade	Emily	But though her cooking had been satisfactory to the scion of a royal family in whose exalted household she had previously seen service, she had not succeeded in meeting the culinary standards of even the least exacting Bostonian who had employed her; and [MASK], while feeling certain that she was available, shrank from approaching her.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Emily	There would no longer be any sound reason, under such an arrangement, for [MASK] to postpone her return to her own house. Yet she still felt no impulsion to go there. She did not want to live there alone, and certainly she did not want to live there with anyone else.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dolly	I’m worrying about my dinner.” “Then I wouldn’t worry about that, any longer.” “Evidently I don’t have to. [MASK]’s opening the front door right now.” Her voice betrayed her relief; but this was short-lived.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Priscilla	[MASK] managed to fight herself free and get into another berth—an upper one. But meanwhile, she’d learned that attempted rape isn’t just a legal expression.” “Did she tell you all these things herself?” “Yes, by degrees.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Divinity	If the sensation of peace and the seeming awareness of [MASK] which came to her almost instantly after she entered the chapel, tranquilizing her and uplifting her as long as she remained there, were only part of a “passing phase” she could not depend on them for succor and support.
<name>Mrs. Merdle</name>	Mrs. Merdle	Caroline	[MASK]’s harsh voice penetrated to the second story. “We’re not to take our wraps upstairs? Are you sure? You look like a new maid. Probably you don’t know. I always go upstairs.”
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Emily	There was no denying that [MASK], in spite of her inexperience, had somehow produced a very pleasing effect. But after all, this was not so strange when one considered that she had all that loot of her wicked old grandmother to draw on, besides spending money like a drunken sailor herself.
<name>John</name>	John	Roger	And he’s kept his promise all these years. It must have been awfully hard for him. I think he deserves a lot of credit.” “So do I,” said [MASK] heartily, thinking with gratitude of his pleasant poker games.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Collinses	You’d better stop insulting my family—after all they’ve done for you! You can go and see your precious [MASK] whenever you like—I don’t care! But I won’t go with you and I won’t have them here in my house!”
<name>Templeton</name>	Templeton	Roger	Why don’t you and [MASK] and I go down to the pond for just a little while and then come back to the house and get our well-earned rest, leaving the others who don’t work as hard as we do to their childish pastimes?”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Pell	He knew he would put in still harder days, while he continued to work on it. No one would suggest that he was not well enough to do that. And he would not be able to talk the case over with [MASK] any longer.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	“Not if luring’s what she wants. I’m going to go right on sitting here. What I’m looking at beats any skating I’ll ever do.” [MASK] was inclined to feel much the same way.
<name>Justine</name>	Justine	Emily	The gloom of the Gloucester Street house had been perennially deepened by “servant troubles,” and [MASK] had not been without secret misgivings lest she should fare no better than her mother when it came to a question of domestic help.
<name>Galt</name>	Galt	Guillion	It isn’t a temporary arrangement. He’s leaving for good too.” “The hell he is! Why, he can’t be! This organization plan of [MASK]’s is just to start some wheels rolling. It isn’t designed for a permanent setup.”
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Roger	“I believe she has seen a similar certificate in different form.” “I offer this certificate,” [MASK] insisted, handing it to the assistant register, who took it and presented it to the bench. “It may be marked,” the judge said, handing it down again.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Roger	Maybe everyone’s world. You haven’t had any preparation so far. If there ever was a girl who needed to learn by experience, it’s you. I think [MASK] can help you to get it, without hurting you too much in the process.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	[MASK] stopped by the iron railing which served as a fence for the yard and watched these children. Evidently it was recess time, but they did not seem to be taking advantage of this to play any real games; they simply bounced their rubber balls, caught them, and bounced them again.
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Emily	It was astonishing how dull reading material could be. [MASK] tried the daily paper, several weeklies, a biography and a murder mystery, without finding anything that arrested her attention. Then she changed the position of several vases and slightly rearranged the flowers these contained.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emily	It couldn’t be true. It’s too—it’s too—” He was unable to go on. [MASK] moved closer to him and put her arms around him. “It is true. I wouldn’t joke about a thing like that.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Brian	[MASK] closed his dripping umbrella and ran rapidly up the steps of the largest and handsomest house in sight, proclaiming his presence in a ringing voice at the same moment that his key turned in the latch. “Hello, everybody! Where are you all keeping yourselves?
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Briny	“Please give us a few more details, [MASK],” she begged, after he had taken several long swallows and given several sighs of deep satisfaction. “It isn’t very informative just to say that you alighted from a plane, even when you add that mendacious touch about your usual dignified fashion.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Deirdre	Would you like me to get [MASK]’s cat?” “No, I hate cats.” “Well, there’s nothing else I can offer you from the animal kingdom, but I’ll come down to the library with you and turn the radio on for you.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Elizabeth	But quite aside from its value, I’d rather have the Russian stuff than anything else. That and the brocades. Evidently, there wasn’t a memorandum about those. But since [MASK]’s willing I should take all the responsibility. . . .”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Emily	But since obviously [MASK] did not have the same sad experience, he wisely did not mention his own. Besides, the next months were so pleasant and profitable, in almost every way, that he realized he should not tempt fate by asking too much of it.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Sumner	I’m not going into that—at least not now. But yesterday, I asked her pointblank when she and [MASK] were going to open the Gloucester Street house again and what do you think she told me? That they weren’t ever going to open it again!
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Mat	“I don’t believe it’s so very different. Why don’t you talk to [MASK] about that someday, if it’s worrying you? He knows more about such things than I do. But, if it were different—no, that wouldn’t trouble me.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	David	So he’s gone after [MASK], has he? In a way, that’s a compliment to the firm, quite a compliment. And, after all, it’s just a temporary arrangement. The other juniors can handle his cases for him all right while he’s gone.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Priscilla	I’m very glad. Because people don’t talk about things like that to just anybody. They only talk about them to people they like a lot and trust a lot.” “I do trust you a lot, I do like you a lot, [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Roger	I believe that’s what’s generally meant by ‘a little talk,’ when a young girl’s concerned. But if you don’t know about those already, you will very soon and you’ll have a much better time learning about them from [MASK] than you would from me.
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Priscilla	Of course he stammers, like so many Bostonians, but, luckily for him, all the exams aren’t oral. ... I think [MASK] knows her own mind to the extent of deciding not to marry him.” “What makes you think he wants to marry her?”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Deirdre	You must have seen her around sometimes too.” “You don’t mean to tell me that the maid who opened the door for me was one of that gang of grimy, runny-nosed children that [MASK] had around all the time?”
<name>John</name>	John	Roger	But it could not be helped. He had decided on his course and he intended to keep it. He wrung [MASK]’s hand and told him again how grateful he was to him and how much he trusted him.
