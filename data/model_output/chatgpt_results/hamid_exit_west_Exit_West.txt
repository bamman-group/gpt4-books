<name>Ellie</name>	Ellie	Saeed	Do things just go black, like a phone screen turning off? Or do you slip into something strange in the middle, like when you’re falling asleep, and you’re both here and there?” [MASK] thought that it depended on how you died.
<name>Delhi</name>	Delhi	Saeed	[MASK]’s mother prayed at home, newly particular about not missing a single one of her devotions, but she insisted on claiming that nothing had changed, that the city had seen similar crises before, though she could not say when, and that the local press and foreign media were exaggerating the danger.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Saeed	For his part [MASK] removed the photo of his parents that he kept hidden in his clothing and placed it on a bookshelf, where it stood, creased, gazing upon them and transforming this narrow bedroom, at least partially, temporarily, into a home.
<name>Aleppo</name>	Aleppo	Saeed	[MASK]’s neighborhood had fallen to the militants, and small-scale fighting had diminished nearby, but large bombs still dropped from the sky and exploded with an awesome power that brought to mind the might of nature itself.
<name>John</name>	John	Saeed	“It’s not a story if it doesn’t have an audience,” his boss was fond of saying, and for [MASK] this meant trying to show a client that his firm truly understood their business, could really get under their skin and see things from their point of view.
<name>Amal</name>	Amal	Nadia	If they caught her, she would get a scolding, or occasionally a slap on the back of the head. The art in [MASK]’s childhood home consisted of religious verses and photos of holy sites, framed and mounted on walls.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Nadia	At [MASK]’s workplace it was much the same, with the added intrigue that came from her boss and her boss’s boss being among those rumored to have fled abroad, since neither had returned as scheduled from their holidays.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Saeed	And that, as they were both fond of saying when recounting the story of their meeting in subsequent years, was that. [MASK]’s mother and father were both readers, and, in different ways, debaters, and they were frequently to be seen in the early days of their romance meeting surreptitiously in bookshops.
<name>Anaïs</name>	Anaïs	Saeed	Of the two, [MASK]’s mother found it more uncomfortable, but she was also the more keen, and so she insisted on repeating the act twice more before dawn. For many years, their balance remained thus. Generally speaking, she was voracious in bed.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Saeed	Maybe, [MASK] thought initially, they feared he might be able to understand them. Later he suspected something else. That they were ashamed, and that they did not yet know that shame, for the displaced, was a common feeling, and that there was, therefore, no particular shame in being ashamed.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Saeed	She looked at him and he looked at her and he did not turn and shoot her, and so she suspected it was him, although [MASK]’s father said it meant nothing more than that she had seen a man who wished to fire in another direction.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Saeed	Upon [MASK]’s arrival his father went to bed and in his bedside mirror glimpsed a suddenly much older man, and his mother was so relieved to see her son that she thought, for a moment, she should slap him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Saeed	[MASK]’s boss had tears in his eyes as he told his employees that he had to shutter his business, apologizing for letting them down, and promising that there would be jobs for them all when things improved and the agency was able to reopen.
<name>The person's name is not given in the passage.</name>	The person's name is not given in the passage.	Nadia	An announcement of the government’s decision was made over television and radio, a temporary antiterrorism measure, it was said, but with no end date given. Internet connectivity was suspended as well. [MASK] did not have a landline at home.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Nadia	So it was not his words that felt to him like an act, but rather his stroking of [MASK]’s hair, which, it seemed to him in that moment, he might never have permission to stroke again.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Saeed	She wondered whether she and [MASK] had done anything by moving, whether the faces and buildings had changed but the basic reality of their predicament had not. But then around her she saw all these people of all these different colors in all these different attires
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Nadia	[MASK] experienced the environment of the house as a bit like that of a university dormitory at the start of classes, with complete strangers living in close proximity, many of them on their best behavior, trying to add warmth to conversations and strike poses of friendship, hoping these gestures would become more natural over time.
<name>Don</name>	Don	Saeed	On one particular night, though, in fact the night after he had struggled to prepare his firm’s pitch to the soap company, [MASK] was absentmindedly scanning along a trajectory that ran below the horizon. In his eyepiece were windows and walls and rooftops, sometimes stationary, sometimes whizzing by at incredible speed.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Saeed	’s, in reality one sits atop the other, a hill atop a hill, a curve atop a curve, and [MASK]’s father’s arc now needed to curve lower, while his son’s still curved higher, for with an old man hampering them these two young people were simply less likely to survive.
<name>Eponine</name>	Eponine	Nadia	[MASK] watched them from her rooftop, alone. Through an open door, a young soldier looked down upon their city, a city not overly familiar to him, for he had grown up in the countryside, and was struck by how big it was, how grand its towers and lush its parks.
<name>Listener</name>	Listener	Saeed	“Nothing is going to happen,” she explained. “I want to make that clear. When I say you should come over, I’m not saying I want your hands on me.” “No. Of course.” [MASK]’s expression had grown traumatized.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Nadia	The activities of the council were mundane, making decisions on room disputes or claims of theft or unneighborly behavior, and also on relations with other houses on the street. Deliberations were often slow and cumbersome, so these gatherings were not particularly thrilling. And yet [MASK] looked forward to them.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Saeed	[MASK] worked on a road crew. His foreman was a knowledgeable and experienced native with a few short tufts of white hair ringing a mostly bald scalp that was covered by his helmet unless he was wiping away his sweat at the end of the day.
<name>Mr. Kurtz</name>	Mr. Kurtz	Saeed	but it was not a hell, and it was familiar but also unfamiliar, and as she wandered about slowly, exploring, she was informed of the proximity of [MASK], and after standing motionless for a considerable moment she communicated with him, and they agreed to meet.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Nadia	But he saw [MASK] seeing him, so intent on his answer, and he said, “I think it would be like falling asleep. You’d dream before you were gone.” It was all the protection he could offer her then.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Saeed	But today, even though the pitch was important—every pitch was important: the economy was sluggish from mounting unrest and one of the first costs clients seemed to want to cut was outdoor advertising—[MASK] couldn’t focus.
<name>he</name>	he	Naditi	He could hear, from time to time, the same artillery that [MASK] could hear, though more loudly. It rattled the windows of his flat, but only in a gentle way, without any risk, at present, of them breaking.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Saeed	[MASK] tried not to sound annoyed. “We’ve left that place.” “That doesn’t mean we have no connection.” “They’re not like me.” “You haven’t met them.” “I don’t need to.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Saeed	And so neither expected, when a handwritten note from the agent arrived, pushed under their apartment door one morning and telling them precisely where to be at precisely what time the following afternoon, that [MASK]’s father would say, “You two must go, but I will not come.”
<name>Laetitia</name>	Laetitia	Nadia	As he undressed that night he did not speak of it, but also he did not hide it from [MASK], and upon seeing the pistol he thought she would fight with him, or at least argue, for he knew what the council had decided.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Saeed	[MASK] seemed surprised and extremely excited when she suggested he come. “Nothing is going to happen,” she explained. “I want to make that clear. When I say you should come over, I’m not saying I want your hands on me.”
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Saeed	[MASK] too prayed more often in this period, at the very least once a day, and he valued the discipline of it, the fact that it was a code, a promise he had made, and that he stood by.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Nadia	Then [MASK] went to the insurance company that employed her, handled fleet policies until lunch. Her tone was steady and businesslike. The callers she dealt with only rarely said words that were inappropriate. Or asked her for her personal number. Which, when they did, she would not give.
<name>He</name>	He	Saeed	“Here we have our own room,” she said, softening her tone. “Just the two of us. It’s a big luxury. Why would we give that up to sleep apart? Among dozens of strangers?” [MASK] had no answer for this.
<name>Nadia</name>	Nadia	Nadia	But [MASK] nodded. And while her eyes were warm, she did not smile. Refugees had occupied many of the open places in the city, pitching tents in the greenbelts between roads, erecting lean-tos next to the boundary walls of houses, sleeping rough on sidewalks and in the margins of streets.
<name>Lisa</name>	Lisa	Nadia	[MASK] hefted two laptop computers in their carrying cases and her floor’s flat-screen TV, but in the end she did not take the TV because it would have been dif- ficult to load onto her motorcycle, and passed it instead to a somber-faced colleague who thanked her politely.
<name>She</name>	She	Nadia	Her tone was steady and businesslike. The callers she dealt with only rarely said words that were inappropriate. Or asked her for her personal number. Which, when they did, she would not give. [MASK] had been seeing a musician for some time.
<name>Mattie</name>	Mattie	Saeed	The curfew [MASK]’s parents had been waiting for was duly imposed, and enforced with hair-trigger zeal, not just sandbagged checkpoints and razor wire proliferating but also howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles and tanks with their turrets clad in the rectangular barnacles of explosive reactive armor.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nadia	[MASK] passed her family’s home once on purpose, not to speak with them, just to see from the outside if they were there and well, but the home she had forsaken looked deserted, with no sign of inhabitants or life.
<name>Madonna</name>	Madonna	nadia	Took a sip. And spoke, the lower half of her face obscured by her cup. “So men don’t fuck with me,” she said. When [MASK] wa s a child, her favorite subject was art, even though art was taught only once a week
<name>he</name>	he	Saeed	In that instant [MASK] was reminded of those soldiers he had seen in the city of his birth, returning on leave from battle, who, when you pestered them for stories about where they had been and what they had done, looked at you as if you had no idea how much you were asking.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Saeed	She fell in behind her parents, who nodded at [MASK] in recognition, and he turned and led them all from that place, a place that was already beginning to be theirs, to another where going forward they could reliably find a meal. The northern summer evenings were endless.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Nadia	Unlike [MASK], he felt in part guilty that they and their fellow residents were occupying a home that was not their own, and guilty also at the visible deterioration brought on by their presence, the presence of over fifty inhabitants in a single dwelling.
<name>one</name>	one	Nadia	The cook had eyes that seemed an almost inhuman blue, or rather a blue that [MASK] had not previously thought of as human, so pale as to suggest, if you looked at them when the cook was looking away, that these eyes might be blind.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Nadia	[MASK]’s experiences during her first months as a single woman living on her own did, in some moments, equal or even surpass the loathsomeness and dangerousness that her family had warned her about. But she had a job at an insurance company, and she was determined to survive, and so she did.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Saeed	[MASK]’s mother had the commanding air of a schoolteacher, which she formerly was, and his father the slightly lost bearing of a university professor, which he continued to be—though on reduced wages, for he was past the official retirement age and had been forced to seek out visiting faculty work.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Nadia	To have a room to themselves—four walls, a window, a door with a lock—seemed incredible good fortune, and [MASK] was tempted to unpack, but she knew they needed to be ready to leave at any moment, and so she took out of their backpack only items that were absolutely required.
<name>the mother</name>	the mother	Saeed	Neighborhoods fell to the militants in startlingly quick succession, so that [MASK]’s mother’s mental map of the place where she had spent her entire life now resembled an old quilt, with patches of government land and patches of militant land.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Nadia	To flee forever is beyond the capacity of most: at some point even a hunted animal will stop, exhausted, and await its fate, if only for a while. “What do you think happens when you die?” [MASK] asked him.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Saeed	Perhaps because she did not, until [MASK]’s conception two decades later, get pregnant, and assumed therefore she could not, she was able to have sex with abandon, without, that is, thought of consequences or the distractions of child-rearing.
<name>him</name>	him	Saeed	He took a draft to his boss and suppressed a wince while sliding it over. But his boss seemed preoccupied and didn’t notice. He just jotted some minor edits on the printout, handed it back to [MASK] with a wistful smile, and said, “Send it out.”
<name>Case</name>	Case	Saeed	“He didn’t,” [MASK] said. “He just removed the lighting. By computer, I think.” “And he left the stars bright.” “No, above these cities you can barely see the stars. Just like here.
<name>he</name>	he	Saeed	They spoke quietly under the clouds, glimpsing occasionally a gash of moon or of darkness, and otherwise seeing ripples and churns of city-lit gray. It was all very normal at first, and [MASK] wondered if she was perhaps teasing him, or if she had been deceived and sold a dud batch.
<name>Karenin</name>	Karenin	Nadia	“For me too,” [MASK] replied, resting her head on his shoulder. “The end of the world can be cozy at times.” She laughed. “Yes. Like a cave.” “You smell a bit like a caveman,” she added later.
<name>Rosie</name>	Rosie	Nadia	[MASK] worked on a mostly female crew that laid pipe, colossal spools and pallets of it in different colors, orange and yellow and black and green. Through these pipes soon would run the lifeblood and thoughts of the new city, all those things that connect people without requiring them to move.
<name>Birdie</name>	Birdie	Nadia	But when they looked at you there was no doubt that they saw, for this woman gazed so powerfully, she was such a watcher, that her watching hit you like a physical force, and [MASK] felt a thrill being seen by her, and seeing her in turn.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Saeed	The Mars it showed was more detailed as well, though it was of course a Mars from another moment, a bygone Mars, fixed in memory by the application’s creator. In the distance [MASK]’s family heard the sound of automatic gunfire, flat cracks that were not loud and yet carried to them cleanly.
<name>Robinson</name>	Robinson	Nadia	Days passed like this, full of waiting and false hopes, days that might have been days of boredom, and were for many, but [MASK] had the idea that they should explore the island as if they were tourists.
<name>she</name>	she	Nadia	It would have been a simple matter to stream this music from various websites, but they tried to economize in all things, including the data bundles they had purchased for their phones, and so [MASK] downloaded pirated versions whenever she could find them, and they listened to these.
<name>Saeed</name>	Saeed	Saeed	In the morning when he woke she was watching him and he stroked her hair and she touched his bristles above his lip and below his ear with her finger and he kissed her and things felt good between them. They packed up and [MASK] hef ted the large backpack and Nadia the tent
<name>Xiao</name>	Xiao	Nadia	But soon the shelves of shops near her were close to bare, even of vegetables, and when the government instituted a policy that no one person could buy more than a certain amount per day, [MASK], like many others, was both panicked and relieved.
<name>Oedipa</name>	Oedipa	Saeed	[MASK]’s mother would sometimes wonder whether he did this out of genuine desire or habit or simply for closeness. She tried her best to respond. He would eventually come to be rebuffed by his own body at least as much as by hers.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Saeed	But at night, after dinner, unless one had access to a home where such things were safe and permitted, or had a car, there were few places to be alone. [MASK]’s family had a car, but it was being repaired, and so he had come by scooter.
<name>she</name>	she	Nadia	He did not press the point, but when [MASK] brought her face close to his in bed that night, close enough to tickle his lips with her breathing, he was unable to muster the enthusiasm to bridge the tiny distance it would have taken to kiss.
<name>her</name>	her	Nadia	But much as she enjoyed their chats and the improved mood between them, they rarely touched, and her desire to be touched by him, long subsided, did not flicker back into flame. It seemed to [MASK] that something had gone quiet inside her.
<name>her</name>	her	Nadia	The agent spoke softly, almost sweetly, his whisper bringing to mind that of a poet or a psychopath. He instructed them to stand still, to not turn around. He told [MASK] to uncover her head, and when she asked why, he said it was not a request.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Saeed	Once upstairs she threw a quilt over her bed and pushed her dirty clothes into the closet. She filled a small shopping bag, paused another minute, and dropped it out a window. The bag landed beside [MASK] with a muffled thump.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Nadia	[MASK] began to put her folded clothes back on but all of a sudden could not bear to, the stench from them was overpowering, and so she was about to wash them in the tub when she heard a banging on the door and realized she must have locked it.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Nadia	Once, he was alone, arriving home while [MASK] was at a meeting of the council, and the woman in the leather jacket stood in the hall, blocking his way with her narrow, jagged form, her back leaning against one wall, a foot planted on the other.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Nadia	[MASK] took her record player and records and clothes and food, and her parched but possibly revivable lemon tree, and also some money and gold coins, which she had left hidden in the tree’s clay plot, buried within the soil.
<name>Bartleby</name>	Bartleby	Nadia	[MASK] rented the top portion of a narrow building belonging to a widow whose children and grandchildren all lived abroad. This building had once been a single house, but it was constructed adjacent to a market that had subsequently grown past and around it.
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Saeed	The mother was tall and narrow-shouldered, as tall as the father, and the daughter was a slightly smaller version of her mother, nearly equal to [MASK] in height, though he suspected she was still very young, likely just thirteen or fourteen.
<name>He</name>	He	Saeed	she asked. [MASK] conjured up his most endearing grin. “Not always. Sadly.” Her expression did not change. So he persevered, clinging to his grin with the mounting desperation of a doomed rock climber: “I think it’s personal.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Nadia	Outside the house much was random and chaotic, but inside, perhaps, a degree of order could be built. Maybe even a community. There were rough people in the house, but there were rough people everywhere, and in life roughness had to be managed. [MASK] thought it madness to expect anything else.
<name>John</name>	John	Saeed	[MASK] was angry that she was toying with him, and alarmed also, and he considered turning around and coming back later. But he realized at that moment that there was a man behind him, a tough-looking Nigerian man.
<name>Clear Channel</name>	Clear Channel	Saeed	[MASK]’s employer was an agency that specialized in the placement of outdoor advertising. They owned billboards all around the city, rented others, and struck deals for further space with the likes of bus lines, sports stadiums, and proprietors of tall buildings.
<name>Eleazar</name>	Eleazar	Saeed	And she had no answer to this. But she stayed anyway, next to [MASK] on the naked earth that had been stripped of plants by hundreds of thousands of footsteps and rutted by the tires of ponderously heavy vehicles, feeling for the first time unwelcome.
<name>He</name>	He	Saeed	We can see.” Later as they lay in bed listening to an old and slightly scratched bossa nova LP, [MASK] showed her on his phone images by a French photographer of famous cities at night, lit only by the glow of the stars.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Saeed	A uterus began to prolapse, an erection became harder to maintain. During this phase, [MASK]’s father started to be cast, or to cast himself, more and more often, as the one who tried to initiate sex.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Saeed	[MASK] did not like to admit it but he was intimidated by her, by her intensity and by the speed and unpredictability of her words, words that he often could not understand, but words that made others laugh.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Saeed	She had planned to go to the graveyard alone, but [MASK] had called her and asked through her silences what was the matter, and she had somehow told him, and he had offered to join her, insisted without insisting, which strangely came as a kind of relief.
<name>Amir</name>	Amir	Saeed	She had placed a long cushion, its cover woven like a rug, on the floor of her terrace, and she sat on this cushion with her back against the parapet and motioned for [MASK] to do the same.
<name>her</name>	her	Nadia	It seemed to [MASK] that the farther they moved from the city of their birth, through space and through time, the more he sought to strengthen his connection to it, tying ropes to the air of an era that for her was unambiguously gone.
<name>She</name>	She	Nadia	In the stairwell he turned to her and said, “Listen, would you like to have a coffee,” and after a brief pause added, to make it seem less forward, given her conservative attire, “in the cafeteria?” [MASK] looked him in the eye.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Saeed	“Why would we want to move?” she said. “To be among our own kind,” [MASK] answered. “What makes them our kind?” “They’re from our country.” “From the country we used to be from.”
<name>Hiroko</name>	Hiroko	Saeed	Because of the flying robots high above in the darkening sky, unseen but never far from people’s minds in those days, [MASK] walked with a slight hunch, as though cringing a tad at the thought of the bomb or missile one of them might at any moment dispatch.
<name>her sister</name>	her sister	Saeed	She and [MASK] were fortunate that their homes remained for a while in government-controlled neighborhoods, and so were spared much of the worst fighting and also the retaliatory air strikes that the army was calling in on localities thought not merely to be occupied but disloyal.
<name>He</name>	He	Saeed	The agency occupied both floors of a converted townhouse and had over a dozen employees. [MASK] was among the most junior, but his boss liked him and had tasked him with turning around a pitch to a local soap company that had to go out by email before five.
<name>he</name>	he	Saeed	The crowd filled the narrow road and overflowed into the margins and stretched many hundreds of meters at its longest, and [MASK] wondered where they were going, and then up ahead he saw they were approaching a hotel or resort of some kind.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Saeed	She found mustaches and being taken from behind erotic. He found her carnal and motivating. After [MASK] was born, the frequency with which his parents had sex dipped notably, and it continued to decline going forward. A uterus began to prolapse, an erection became harder to maintain.
<name>Mulan</name>	Mulan	Nadia	The police didn’t bother with them. The soldiers stopped everyone. They made [MASK] remove her helmet, perhaps thinking she might be a man disguised as a woman, but when they saw this was not the case, they waved her through.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Nadia	[MASK] would never be able to determine what had become of them, but she always hoped they had found a way to depart unharmed, abandoning the city to the predations of warriors on both sides who seemed content to flatten it in order to possess it.
<name>Amira</name>	Amira	Saeed	“I can understand it,” she said. “Imagine if you lived here. And millions of people from all over the world suddenly arrived.” “Millions arrived in our country,” [MASK] replied. “When there were wars nearby.”
<name>her</name>	her	Nadia	They knew there was a possibility the agent had sold them out to the militants, and so they knew there was a possibility this was the final afternoon of their lives. The rendezvous point was in a converted house next to a market that reminded [MASK] of her former home.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Saeed	[MASK] asked where the door was and where it led to, and the agent replied that the doors were everywhere but finding one the militants had not yet found, a door not yet guarded, that was the trick, and might take a while.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Nadia	As they drew nearer he glimpsed a line of men in uniform blocking their way, and he told [MASK], and they were both frightened, and started to slow down, and allow people to pass them, because they had seen in their city what happens when bullets are fired into an unarmed mass of people.
<name>Yorick</name>	Yorick	Saeed	But his father always kept a mustache, at his mother’s insistence. And they never once changed their bed: its headboard like the posts of a banister, almost demanding to be gripped. In what [MASK]’s family called their living room there was a telescope, black and sleek.
<name>Marcelle</name>	Marcelle	Nadia	[MASK] at first thought there was no need to say goodbye, that saying goodbye involved a kind of presumption, but then she felt a small sadness, and knew she needed to say goodbye, not for him, for she doubted he would care, but for her.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Saeed	She decided to make her approach. Standing in front of [MASK]’s father she proceeded to talk animatedly with a friend while ignoring the object of her desire. He noticed her. He listened to her. He summoned the nerve to speak to her.
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Nadia	It was [MASK] who first brought up the topic of her moving out of the shanty, said in passing as she sipped on a joint, taking the slenderest of puffs, held in her lungs even as the idea of what she had said scented the air.
