<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Scarpetta	“You can’t do that. You’re not a cop.” “Oh, I’m worse than any cop. Trust me.” [MASK] picks up the bundle of linens and places it on top of the bare mattress. “What next?”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Rudy	Some hit man who’s going to take us out in the middle of a busy highway?” She doesn’t blame [MASK] for losing his temper with her, but she can’t allow it. “Don’t yell at me,” she says.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marino	No one has touched this key in some time, months at least, maybe longer, she thinks, and on the porch she gives it to [MASK] because she doesn’t want to be the one to unlock the house. The door creaks open to a musty odor.
<name>NASA</name>	NASA	DNA	“It’ll be just my luck [MASK] will decide to do something with the hairs, although they didn’t seem interested last week. So I’m not going to permanently mount this one or the others. Everybody’s acting weird these days.
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Gilly	She doesn’t want to go into graphic detail about how uniformly hard or consolidated and lumpy and inflamed [MASK]’s lungs would have been had she died of acute bronchopneumonia. “Was your daughter on antibiotics?” “Oh yes. The first week she was.”
<name>John</name>	John	Marino	She doesn’t indicate that [MASK] should leave. She doesn’t even seem aware of him sitting in the chair to the left of the couch, not even two feet from where she sits. “If you don’t get out, I’m calling someone.
<name>She</name>	She	Lucy	Their varying shades are more subtle and can be as soft as haze or as hard as metal. Right now, he misses her more than he knew he did. Right now [MASK] has brought back his pain with a fresh cruelty.
<name>Griffith</name>	Griffith	Fielding	You mix up those dentures in a homicide case, and you’ve just given the defense attorneys quite a gift, even if the dentures have absolutely nothing to do with anything.” “Whose dentures?” he asks, scowling. “[MASK] is supposed to be supervising.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Marino	She feels what he is interested in and isn’t sure what she wants to do about it. “Give [MASK] the credit, not me. That’s all I’m saying. He’s been through it. A little credit would be a good thing for him right now.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Marino	It is not quite noon yet and the shops aren’t very busy. A few people in stylish business suits are buying coffee and moving about as if they have places to go and important lives, and [MASK] can’t stom- ach people like the ones in the James Center.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lucy	“I wouldn’t exactly call it the same thing,” [MASK] replies, looking up at her, noticing how thin she has gotten and aware of something in her eyes she wasn’t aware of in the beginning. “Almost being killed is a detached way of saying it.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Browning	“Nothing to make [MASK] think that, apparently. Like I said, he’s not revved up about it. Never a good thing. If the detective’s not revved up about it, then the crime scene techs probably aren’t revved up either.
<name>She</name>	She	Henri	Even if he could, that doesn’t mean all people can be fixed. [MASK] is not a hostage. She could leave anytime. It profoundly unsettles him that she seems to have no interest in leaving, that she just might be enjoying herself.
<name>Smiths</name>	Smiths	Paulssons	She begins to lose faith when she sees no lights on in the brick house with the mossy slate roof that is on the other side of the [MASK]’ backyard fence. “You sure he’ll be here?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Scarpetta	[MASK] detects the raw edge of a rash peeking out from the v-neck collar of his surgical scrubs, and she follows the white sleeves of his unbuttoned lab coat, over the contours of his arms, to his raw, scaly hands.
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Gilly	He killed your little girl. Or maybe you don’t care about that. She was such a pain in the ass, [MASK] was. I heard about what a slob she was. All you did was pick up after her spoiled little ass . . .”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Scarpetta	He watches the old blue Im-pala pull into a driveway two houses down, and he wonders why it is stopping there and who it belongs to. [MASK] hesitates as if his last-minute suggestion doesn’t suit her, then she replies, “Of course.
<name>Tempe</name>	Tempe	Fielding	So maybe the teeth are his?” says the soldier in purple. “So it was his teeth on the cart?” [MASK] looks like an angry blue jay flapping across the autopsy suite and yanking open the enormous stainless-steel door of the cooler.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Scarpetta	It is nowhere in sight. She takes off her cotton gloves and tucks them in her suit pocket. “He ought to be after what he did.” “You can stop that story now,” [MASK] says, filling the glass coffeepot with tap water.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Scarpetta	“You drank a few beers and ate a steak and a salad starting at seven,” [MASK] prods him in that easygoing but unstoppable way of hers. “How many beers, exactly?” “Four, I think.” “Not think.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Gilly	“I’d like to explain a few things.” “Oh. I guess we can.” She stands and is shaky on her feet. “A red rose?” “When did [MASK] see her father last?”
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Kate	She can do destructive testing on the drawing, and she looks out the window at her neighbor’s house and wonders if [MASK] has begun her return trip from drunk, believing that going around the bend will somehow make her less drunk, or whatever it is that people believe when they are drunk.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Rudy	People passing me in the right lane, and that guy over there’s got an expired inspection sticker.” She points. “And the cop’s more interested in me.” She stops checking on him in the rearview mirror and wishes that [MASK] would lighten his mood.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Lucy	Well, you said you don’t like going to the doctor, so you probably haven’t had a thorough physical in quite a while. Not bloodwork, either, I am to assume?” “They’re enlarged?” [MASK] says, reacting with the expected panic.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lucy	As far as [MASK] knows. What does she know, really? Not a hell of a lot. She flips through a printout from a different computer search she ran last night, and she deliberates over whether to call her aunt.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Marino	The darkness was so complete it was thick and airless and it wrapped around him like black cloth as he tried to get to his feet without making noise and giving away his position. The bastard was in here somewhere, and [MASK] didn’t ■2 & 4 have his gun.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Kate	The small, innocuous piece of spy equipment is off-white, the same bland color as the wall socket, and not something [MASK] is likely to notice or care about if she does. Should she decide to plug something into the adapter, that is fine.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Lucy	[MASK]’s gloved hands reach into the snow between her feet and she picks up a handful of powder and looks at it. “Apparently you gave an interview about my hiring you. You never told me.” “What interview?” “The Hollywood Reporter.
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Scarpetta	“Pulmonary edema?” she asks. “Some.” [MASK] has found the tongue. She walks over to the sinks and rinses it, patting it dry with a small white terry-cloth towel from an especially cheap batch purchased by the state.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Sweetie	Now you know if you have [MASK] in the bed loving up on him, and I know you are, he’s going to come to expect it. And a little ol’ basset hound with his little short legs can’t be getting up and down off that bed by himself.”
<name>Marilyn</name>	Marilyn	Brenda	The room is also used for children and was filled with stuffed animals. The wallpaper was Winnie the Pooh, bears, honeypots, trees. [MASK] wasn’t wearing a nurse’s uniform. She had on a light blue suit.” “You weren’t there.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucy	I used to think about that from time to time and feel sorry for the poor med student whose luck of the draw was to get her withered, ugly old body.” He is calmer and more sure of himself, and the more confident he gets, the more [MASK]’s hatred rises like bile.
<name>Johnson</name>	Johnson	Scarpetta	His secretary’s office is an attractive collection of cherry-stained furniture and colonial prints, and her computer’s screensaver shows several tropical fish swimming endlessly on a vivid blue screen. The secretary is out, and [MASK] knocks on the chief’s door.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Benton	Each lined page is numbered and in the upper right-hand corner is a date. [MASK] rubs his angular jaw, remembering that he hasn’t shaved in two days, and his rough, graying beard reminds him of the bristly trees on the mountains.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Dalessio	They’ll spend the rest of their careers trying to figure out who the hell [MASK] is and did he quit or get fired or what? Did anyone ever meet him? He’ll become a legend, give them something to talk about.”
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Henri	“But you didn’t just get up. You got up, came in, and we talked, and then you took a shower.” “My name isn’t [MASK],” she says. “What would you like me to call you?”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Lucy	I could find out a hell of a lot more, but preliminarily, that’s it.” “[MASK], I know you’re trying to help. You’re amazing. I wouldn’t want you after me. And he’s not a nice man.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Scarpetta	“Knock his brains right out of his head. Wouldn’t need no tractor to run him over after that.” [MASK] is writing all this down. Now and then she looks around thoughtfully and writes something else.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Marino	She walks in as far as the dresser to the left of the doorway, against the wall. [MASK] digs in a pocket and pulls out his cotton gloves. He works his huge hands into them and opens the top dresser drawer.
<name>Rodriguez</name>	Rodriguez	Bobby	He stares at the building, then looks back at his men. “Hey [MASK]!” he calls out. “Can you drill out the lock in the back door? Do it now. All right then,” he says to her. “All right.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Julie	He walks inside [MASK]’s cubicle and picks up a stack of autopsy photographs and starts going through them like playing cards. He snaps one out between forefinger and thumb like a blackjack dealer. “Know why drug dealers got less body fat than let’s say you and me?”
<name>Deacon</name>	Deacon	Marino	ach people like the ones in the James Center. He knows the type. He grew up knowing the type, not personally, but knowing about the type. They were the type who didn’t know [MASK]’s type and never tried to know his type.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Scarpetta	[MASK] remembers turning the corner as she drove around her old building, and the man and his tractor vanished from sight. He must have gotten his tractor started within minutes of her seeing him, and then he died.
<name>B</name>	B	Marino	“Sounds like she wants you to think you did something to her. Why?” & B “Shit if I know. I can’t do it.” “You’re hungover but not stupid, [MASK].” He looks at her.
<name>Scarpetta</name>	Scarpetta	Lucy	Against one wall is a desk that is centered by a Krimesite imager that looks like a stubby telescope mounted on a tripod stand. Next to it is a sealed plastic evidence bag, and inside is the drawing of the eye. [MASK] plucks examination gloves out of a box on the table.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Lord	There is no fear in her eyes. “Take deep breaths. Come on. Breathe deeply. There. That’s good. Slow, deep breaths.” “Oh [MASK], am I having a heart attack?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Scarpetta	“Truth seems hard to find these days,” [MASK] replies, opening the coffee and placing a filter in the coffeemaker, then measuring coffee with a small scoop she found in the bag. “I wonder why that is.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kate	“Actually, yes, I have heard the name. It seems. Maybe,” [MASK] says, encouraged. “I haven’t been in much, not big roles although some of the films have been big. This is my break, you might say.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Dave	“Just be grateful the general public doesn’t see where they’d end up or you wouldn’t get any donations at all,” she replied, heading back to the elevator. “We got to work on those specs for the new building, [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Benton	[MASK] shuts the door and holds her close to him and they kiss deeply and she doesn’t taste salt anymore, just feels his warm, strong tongue and his smooth-shaven face. “You’re letting your hair grow,” she says into his mouth, and she runs her fingers through his hair.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kate	She prints out the tickets on glossy photographic paper and cuts them to size, and tucks them inside an envelope with a note that reads, “Dear [MASK], loved our chat! Here’s a movie trivia quiz: Who’s the one with the long dark curly hair?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	“Come on, [MASK]. Tell the truth! Don’t make it worse for yourself!” “Someone killed her,” he repeats. “I don’t believe it.” “Believe it.” “That can’t be.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Pogue	Don’t get on airplanes, and stay out of gyms. You can get exposed to a lot in gyms. Yes sir, [MASK] replied, although he has never been on an airplane in his life and he hasn’t gone inside a gym since he was in high school.
<name>He</name>	He	Benton	With her, there is so little he knows. She is motionless in her chair, struggling for breath. “You said nobody could get you out,” [MASK] goes on, calmly, quietly, in the unprovocative tone of the counselor he has become for her.
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Benton	He wears neither furs nor gold and he doesn’t look conspicuously rich, but the rich know other rich, and he has a rich air about him because he is rich, very rich. [MASK] had many years of living quietly and invisibly.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Scarpetta	I thought I’d try out a few test cases on the group, especially since we are fortunate enough to have an expert in our midst.” The bastard, [MASK] thinks. So this is what it’s going to be like. The hell with their talk in the library.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Benton	“What?” She stops on the circular drive out front, ignoring the valets in their long coats and cowboy hats. [MASK]’s hard, tan, handsome face looks at her. His eyes smile first, then his lips smile a little as if he is amused.
<name>footsteps</name>	footsteps	Kate	She gets down on the floor as she pulls a small screwdriver out of the fanny pack. The screws in the plate aren’t tight and there are only two of them, and she has them off in seconds as she listens for [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Rudy	The battery is dead. Last night she was too tired and unhappy to think about her phone and she forgot it and left it in her pocket, and that isn’t like her, that is so unlike her. [MASK] doesn’t know where she is staying.
<name>detective</name>	detective	Puritan	Is rough sex a habit of yours?” “You must be some kind of [MASK],” she says, wandering to the table and sitting down. “I guess there must be a lot you’ve never heard of.” “You might be right.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Henri	“Wow! Look at this. Unbelievable. It’s beautiful.” “I don’t think you should have come here,” [MASK] says, pausing and looking at her in deepening shadows that tint the snow blue.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Scarpetta	“I’m thinking someone got on top of her,” [MASK] says. “She’s facedown and the person has a knee in her upper back, leaning on her with all his weight and holding her hands up and out above her head, palms down on the bed.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Marino	“I said that’s not the half of it. A hell of a lot worse than you thought.” [MASK]’s voice comes through intact. “It’s like he brought her in to kick the shit out of her in front of an audience.
<name>Dr. Larch</name>	Dr. Larch	Lucy	Why does all this matter?” His eyes move around the examination room, and he is alert and more confident. “It matters. You’re making things better for yourself. A lot better,” [MASK] assures him and threatens him at the same time.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Gilly	“[MASK] didn’t die of the flu,” she repeats. “We need to know what happened, exactly what happened to her. We will know. Sooner or later. I believe you’d rather have it sooner, wouldn’t you?”
<name>I</name>	I	Benton	The tops of her hands were red because he or she, and [MASK] will not assume the gender of her assailant, bruised her. She had fresh contusions on the tops of her hands, and she had several reddish areas of contusion on her upper back.
<name>Sparky</name>	Sparky	Sweetie	“He say something?” “He said . . .” Her voice goes up and vanishes. “He ... he said, I like [MASK].” “How’d he know your puppy’s name?”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Scarpetta	“You know, I watch some of those TV shows. At least I catch a bit here and there when the wife is watching.” “Don’t believe everything you see.” [MASK] drops more dirt in the bag, then drops in the tongue depressor after it.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Bailey	“You tie string around a major blood vessel such as the carotid so funeral home embalmers don’t have to dig around for it. It’s the polite thing to do, [MASK].” “Yes sir.”
<name>Stryker</name>	Stryker	Stryker	In three words, he has managed to com- pletely deny and mock the reality of people down the hall who are pitifully cold and stiff and zipped inside vinyl and fake fur funeral home pouches, or naked on hard steel gurneys or on hard steel tables, ready for the scalpel and [MASK] saw.
<name>Devon</name>	Devon	Benton	Unzipping her flight suit, she pulls it down to her waist, manipulating the position of the pen so it is angled just right, the wire connected to the cellular interface taped on the inside of the flight suit and not visible. “Not quite so vertical,” [MASK]’s voice is in her ear.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rudy	“I know nothing about an article. What article?” [MASK] reads it to her over the phone, and after he’s finished, he waits to see how she’ll react, and he knows she will react and that makes him feel a little better.
<name>He</name>	He	Benton	He does not encourage her conversation. It is important that he be patient, incredibly patient, like a hunter in the woods who stands perfectly still and barely breathes. “It came into the house. I don’t remember.” [MASK] watches her in silence.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Joe	She vaguely smells cigars as she opens the bag, and it isn’t smoked cigars she thinks she smells but unburnt cigar tobacco, and she shines her light inside the bag and sees bits of tobacco and a receipt. [MASK] is watching her and has steadied his light on the bag in her hands.
<name>John</name>	John	Scarpetta	“We’re trying to find him,” [MASK] says. “Is there anything you can tell me that might give us a lead as to where to look?” “I don’t mean to state the obvious. But what about people he worked with?”
<name>Blue</name>	Blue	Scarpetta	What is it?” [MASK] doesn’t answer him as her light moves around. The baseball bats are gone from the comer where they were propped when she was chief, but there is a lot of dust and bits of bone, quite a lot, she thinks.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Browning	They were always invited to parties, picnics, the Fourth of July cook-out I always had at my home. But you never knew if they’d show up or not,” she says. “He ever show up?” [MASK] is chewing gum.
<name>Lesley</name>	Lesley	Doc	This is about what. What is where trouble lies or doesn’t. Psychiatrists don’t care much about what.” “I know. What is it. What sure as hell is the problem, all right. I don’t know what, [MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Virginia	He knew that at the time. They couldn’t figure out for the life of them why [MASK] was interested in him, of all people, unless it was because he was nonconfrontational and nonpolitical and nonexistent. He knew what the women in his office were saying at the time.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Scarpetta	I tried that out day one, and to cut to the chase, we’re talking aluminum.” “Something aluminum painted with red, white, and blue enamel paint,” [MASK] thinks out loud. “Mixed with bone dust.”
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Lucy	I I I Ten o’clock the next morning, [MASK] walks around the room, picking up magazines and acting impatient and bored. She hopes that the helicopter pilot sitting near the television will hurry up and go in for his appointment or get an urgent call and leave.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Lucy	“I'm still not sure she didn’t, that she didn’t stage the whole thing.” “She didn’t do it,” [MASK] says, refusing to look at the damaged hood. “I had to wait on a list for more than a year to get that car.”
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Scarpetta	He reaches inside a jacket pocket and pulls out the receipt [MASK] found on the bone-dusty floor in the Anatomical Division of her old building. The receipt is inside a transparent plastic bag, and he places it on the counter. “How long you worked here?”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Rudy	“Genetic wiring, bad wiring. From my crazy Latino biological father. Hopefully, not from my mother, although it would be worse to be like her. Much worse.” [MASK] says nothing, staring at the rising bridge giving way to a yacht.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Marino	“I’ll tell you why the FBI’s involved.” It is [MASK] who offers this. “At least I’ll tell you what the Richmond PD has to say about it, if you really want to know.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Henri	“As much as one can assign logic to a nutcase like him. Thing is, I don’t even remember him. He probably doesn’t really remember you, [MASK]. All of us are just a means to an end sometimes, I guess.”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Fielding	“Scrub those things before you put them in her mouth,” she can’t help but say as [MASK] hands the misplaced dentures to the soldier in purple. “You don’t need another person’s DNA, or other people’s DNA, in her mouth,” she tells the soldier.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Henri	“You were sick in bed, [MASK]. Are you sure you know what she drove that day?” “I always know. She wasn’t driving the black Ferrari because it got damaged.” “Tell me about the damage.”
<name>his</name>	his	Lucy	“And I was just knocking around on the two Euro slot machines and got lucky, boy did I get lucky.” She drains her glass and rubs [MASK]’s arm. “You are very strong, you know.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Gilly	I know it wasn’t there before, not out in her room, not where I could see it. And I’d been in her drawers. I went in them the day before, putting away laundry and things. [MASK] was bad about putting things away.
<name>John</name>	John	Marino	The door creaks open to a musty odor. It is cold inside, and then she thinks she smells cigars. [MASK] feels for a light switch, but when he finds one and flips it up and down, nothing happens. “Here.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kit	It’s lonely up here when [MASK] isn’t around, but she doesn’t feel good. It’s obvious. It’s not right of him to pretend otherwise. “Why don’t you take a break, girl? Did you get a flu shot?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Henri	She had on a light blue suit.” “You weren’t there.” “She told me over the phone.” [MASK] stares at her bare feet, which are up on the chair cushion. “You asked her what she had on?”
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Scarpetta	“We have a different governor,” he went on. “It’s likely she doesn’t even know who you are.” Now he was implying that [MASK] is so unimportant and unsuccessful that the governor has never heard of her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fielding	Her former flagship office is out of control and so is everybody in it. She glances at the dead tractor driver, half undressed on his red-clay-stained sheet, on top of a gurney, and she stares at the dentures in [MASK]’s bloodstained gloved hands.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Marino	[MASK] works himself up to a sitting position and shoves pillows behind his back. She can feel him watching her as she returns to her chair and sits down, tired because she is overwhelmed, her brain a herd of wild horses galloping in fifty different directions.
<name>Swanson</name>	Swanson	Benton	“Everything isn’t ruined. Come on.” She reaches over and squeezes his hand. “A truce? Start all over? Do we need to call in [MASK] for hostage negotiation? Because you’re not just my friend and partner these days.
<name>Rich</name>	Rich	Fielding	“You did the external examination and began the autopsy, and then at some point joined her in the decomp room to reexamine the Paulsson girl.” “Oh yeah,” [MASK] mutters, glancing up from his case file, but not looking at anyone in particular.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Kit	“But I know I didn’t mislabel a sample. I never have. Not once. At least not once when I didn’t catch it right away and the courts were none the wiser.” “I understand.” “Do you remember [MASK]?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lucy	[MASK] can do whatever she likes and still have money and order people around, and he can’t. Not even when he was a sworn police officer could he flaunt power the way she does. But he’s not afraid of her, he tells himself.
