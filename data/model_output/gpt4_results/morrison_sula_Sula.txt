<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Nel	Damp-faced, [MASK] stepped back into the kitchen. She felt new, soft and new. It had been the longest time since she had had a rib-scraping laugh. She had forgotten how deep and down it could be.
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Mamma	“I aim to.”’ “Bible say honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land thy God giveth thee.” “[MASK] must have skipped that part. Her days wasn’t too long.” “Pus mouth!
<name>Nettie</name>	Nettie	Hannah	He just wild with me. Be glad when he growed and gone.” [MASK] smiled and said, “Shut your mouth. You love the ground he pee on.” “Sure I do. But he still a pain. Can’t help loving your own child.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sula	But thinking that [MASK] had an odd way of looking at things and that her wide smile took some of the sting from that rattlesnake over her eye. A funny woman, he thought, not that bad-looking.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Virtue	At thirty her hot brown eyes had turned to agate, and her skin had taken on the sheen of maple struck down, split and sanded at the height of its green. [MASK], bleak and drawn, was her only mooring.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Sula	[MASK] acknowledged none of their attempts at counter-conjure or their gossip and seemed to need the services of nobody. So they watched her far more closely than they watched any other roach or bitch in the town, and their alertness was gratified. Things began to happen.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Nel	“Yes. But my lonely is mine. Now your lonely is somebody else’s. Made by somebody else and handed to you. Ain’t that something? A secondhand lonely.” [MASK] sat back on the little wooden chair.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Teapot	He had run across the street to [MASK]’s Mamma, who, when she heard the news, said, “Ho!” like the conductor on the train when it was about to take off except louder, and then did a little dance.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Eva	Maybe one night when you dozing in that wagon flicking flies and swallowing spit, maybe I’ll just tip on up here with some kerosene and—who knows— you may make the brightest flame of them all.” So [MASK] locked her door from then on.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Nel	Hunched down in the small bright room [MASK] waited. Waited for the oldest cry. A scream not for others, not in sympathy for a burnt child, or a dead father, but a deeply personal cry for one’s own pain.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Sula	It was not for them to expel or annihilate it. They would no more run [MASK] out of town than they would kill the robins that brought her back, for in their secret awareness of Him, He was not the God of three faces they sang about.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Plum	“You don’t know her. Did you know she burnt [MASK]?” “Oh, I heard that years ago. But nobody put no stock in it.” “They should have. It’s true. I saw it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jude	“Say what?” [MASK]’s temper flared just a bit as he looked at this friend of his wife’s, this slight woman, not exactly plain, but not fine either, with a copperhead over her eye.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sula	Still picking his nose, his eyes wide, he came to where they were standing. [MASK] took him by the hand and coaxed him along. When they reached the base of the beech, she lifted him to the first branch, saying, “Go on.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sula	What for?” “She made me nervous.” “But she was doing it for nothing, [MASK].” “That’s what you think. She was stealing right and left.” “Since when did you get froggy about folks’ stealing?”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Hannah	Using her stump as a support on the window sill, her good leg as a lever, she threw herself out of the window. Cut and bleeding she clawed the air trying to aim her body toward the flaming, dancing figure. She missed and came crashing down some twelve feet from [MASK]’s smoke.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nel	I used to walk around holding it very stiff because I thought a strong wind or a heavy push would snap my neck. [MASK] was the one who told me the truth. But she was wrong. I did not hold my head stiff enough when I met him
<name>Rosemary</name>	Rosemary	Laura	How is she anyway? ” “Same, I guess. Not so hot.” “No? [MASK], I know, was doing her cooking and things. Is she still?” “No. I put her out.” “Put her out?
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Nel	You know what cleanliness is next to.. “Hush.” [MASK]’s plea was clipped off by the slam of the bathroom door. “What y’all laughing at?” “Old time-y stuff. Long gone, old time-y stuff.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eva	and then it traveled on up her leg and wouldn’t stop growing until she put a red rag at the top but by that time it was already at her knee. Somebody said [MASK] stuck it under a train and made them pay off.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hannah	She ended this deep perusal by tying a green ribbon in her hair. The green silk made a rippling whisper as she slid it into her hair—a whisper that could easily have been [MASK]’s chuckle, a soft slow nasal hiss she used to emit when something amused her.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sula	It was like getting the use of an eye back, having a cataract removed. Her old friend had come home. [MASK]. Who made her laugh, who made her see old things with new eyes, in whose presence she felt clever, gentle and a little raunchy.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Each	[MASK] then looked around for more debris to throw into the hole: paper, bits of glass, butts of cigarettes, until all of the small defiling things they could find were collected there. Carefully they replaced the soil and covered the entire grave with uprooted grass.
<name>Candelaria</name>	Candelaria	Helene	The grandmother took [MASK] away from the soft lights and flowered carpets of the Sundown House and raised her under the dolesome eyes of a multicolored Virgin Mary, counseling her to be constantly on guard for any sign of her mother’s wild blood.
<name>Remember</name>	Remember	Jude	And even when you began to talk, I couldn’t hear because I was worried about you not knowing that your fly was open and scared too because your eyes looked like the soldiers’ that time on the train when my mother turned to custard. Remember how big that bedroom was? [MASK]?
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Nel	They both knew that those women were not jealous of other women; that they were only afraid of losing their jobs. Afraid their husbands would discover that no uniqueness lay between their legs. [MASK] was the one person who had wanted nothing from her, who had accepted all aspects of her.
<name>She</name>	She	Nel	“About who was good. How you know it was you?” “What you mean?” “I mean maybe it wasn’t you. Maybe it was me.” [MASK] took two steps out the door and closed it behind her.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Sula	I can’t hardly believe that. She almost died trying to get to your mother.” [MASK] leaned forward, her elbows on the table. “You ever known me to lie to you? ” “No. But you could be mistaken.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	BoyBoy	and you wait for the happy signs. Hating [MASK], she could get on with it, and have the safety, the thrill, the consistency of that hatred as long as she wanted or needed it to define and strengthen her or protect her from routine vulnerabilities.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helene	No change in the expression of the eyes, but a hard wetness that veiled them as they looked at the stretch of her mother’s foolish smile. As the door slammed on the conductor’s exit, [MASK] walked down the aisle to a seat.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Shadrack	And all the while [MASK] stood there. Having forgotten his song and his rope, he just stood there high up on the bank ringing, ringing his bell. Things were so much better in 1965. Or so it seemed.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Eva	With other people’s affairs [MASK] was equally prejudiced about men. She fussed interminably with the brides of the newly wed couples for not getting their men’s supper ready on time; about how to launder shirts, press them, etc. “Yo’ man be here direc’lin.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Sula	It don’t do nothing for me.” “You never had to.” “I never would.” “There’s something to say for it, [MASK]. ’Specially if you don’t want people to have to do for you.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	He tried the other and found it also. Slowly he directed one hand toward the cup and, just as he was about to spread his fingers, they began to grow in higgledy-piggledy fashion like [MASK]’s beanstalk all over the tray and the bed.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Nel	In concert, without ever meeting each other’s eyes, they stroked the blades up and down, up and down. [MASK] found a thick twig and, with her thumbnail, pulled away its bark until it was stripped to a smooth, creamy innocence.
<name>Elaine</name>	Elaine	Nel	Now there weren’t any places left, just separate houses with separate televisions and separate telephones and less and less dropping by. These were the same thoughts she always had when she walked down into the town. One of the last true pedestrians, [MASK] walked the shoulder road while cars slipped by.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sula	This keenest of insults that a mother can feel, the rejection by a child of her food, bent her into fury and she beat him as she had not done since [MASK] knocked him down the steps. She was not alone.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Nel	The white people had to wash her, dress her, prepare her and finally lower her. It was all done elegantly, for it was discovered that she had a substantial death policy. [MASK] went to the funeral parlor, but was so shocked by the closed coffin she stayed only a few minutes.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Helene	The woman pointed out the window and said, “Yes, ma’am. Yonder.” [MASK] looked out of the window halfway expecting to see a comfort station in the distance; instead she saw gray-green trees leaning over tangled grass. “Where?”
<name>Mrs. Johnson</name>	Mrs. Johnson	Helene	They ran along the track looking for the coach pointed out to them by the colored porter. Even at that they made a mis- take. [MASK] and her daughter entered a coach peopled by some twenty white men and women.
<name>She</name>	She	Helene	Then she smiled sympathetically and asked, “Kin you make it?” [MASK] nodded and went back to her seat trying to think of other things—for the surest way to have an accident would be to remember her full bladder.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Eva	But she was reluctant to move her face for another reason. If she turned her head, she would not be able to see the boarded-up window [MASK] jumped out of. And looking at those four wooden planks with the steel rod slanting across them was the only peace she had.
<name>Sartre</name>	Sartre	Sula	The body must move and throw itself about, the eyes must roll, the hands should have no peace, and the throat should release all the yearning, despair and outrage that accompany the stupidity of loss. “The real hell of Hell is that it is forever.” [MASK] said that.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sula	Her parents had succeeded in rubbing down to a dull glow any sparkle or splutter she had. Only with [MASK] did that quality have free reign, but their friendship was so close, they themselves had difficulty distinguishing one’s thoughts from the other’s.
<name>Sissy</name>	Sissy	Sula	“Then wait.” “We sick now.” [MASK] leaned over the bed, picked up a shoe and threw it at them. “Cocksucker!” they screamed, and she leaped out of the bed naked as a yard dog.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Eva	Lying in the colored ward of the hospital, which was a screened corner of a larger ward, [MASK] mused over the perfection of the judgment against her. She remembered the wedding dream and recalled that weddings always meant death.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nellie	“I don’t think so and you wouldn’t either if you had children.” “Then I really would act like what you call a man. Every man I ever knew left his children.” “Some were taken.” “Wrong, [MASK].
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Nel	[MASK] looked at it and realized that it was two thirty, only forty-five minutes before the children would be home and she hadn’t even felt anything right or sensible and now there was no time or wouldn’t be until nighttime when they were asleep
<name>It</name>	It	Iceman	“Oh, I don’t know.” “Want some cool tea?” “Mmmm. Lots of ice, I’m burnin’ up.” “[MASK] don’t come yet, but it’s good and cold.” “That’s fine.”
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Helene	While [MASK] looked about the tiny stationhouse for a door that said colored women, the other woman stalked off to a field of high grass on the far side of the track. Some white men were leaning on the railing in front of the stationhouse.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Eva	The Peace women simply loved maleness, for its own sake. [MASK], old as she was, and with one leg, had a regular flock of gentleman callers, and although she did not participate in the act of love, there was a good deal of teasing and pecking and laughter.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sula	She was not breathing because she didn’t have to. Her body did not need oxygen. She was dead. [MASK] felt her face smiling. “Well, I’ll be damned,” she thought, “it didn’t even hurt. Wait’ll
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Shadrack	There were no fences, no warnings, no obstacles at all between concrete and green grass, so one could easily ignore the tidy sweep of stone and cut out in another direction—a direction of one’s own. [MASK] stood at the foot of the hospital steps watch-
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Nel	Now she wanted everything, and all because of that. [MASK] was the first per- son who had been real to her, whose name she knew, who had seen as she had the slant of life that made it possible to stretch it to its limits.
<name>Antanas</name>	Antanas	Plum	Softening the insertion with the dab of lard, she probed with her middle finger to loosen his bowels. Her fingernail snagged what felt like a pebble; she pulled it out and others followed. [MASK] stopped crying as the black hard stools ricocheted onto the frozen ground.
<name>Arturo</name>	Arturo	Rekus	She could break up a marriage before it had even become one—she would make love to the new groom and wash his wife’s dishes all in an afternoon. What she wanted, after [MASK] died, and what she succeeded in having more often than not, was some touching every day.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jude	So it’s all right. I am just standing here. They are not doing that. I am just standing here and seeing it, but they are not really doing it. But then they did look up. Or you did. You did, [MASK].
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Hannah	Just as she got to the third landing she could hear [MASK] and some child’s voice. She swung along, not even listening to the voices of alarm and the cries of the deweys. By the time she got to her bed someone was bounding up the stairs after her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sula	[MASK]. Stop.” And the other one, the one with the scary black thing over her eye, laughing softly and egging their mother on: “Neatness counts. You know what cleanliness is next to.. “Hush.”
<name>herself</name>	herself	Medallion	She knew nothing about him except the word he had called out to her years ago and the feeling he had excited in her then. She had grown quite accustomed to the cliches of other people’s lives as well as her own increasing dissatisfaction with [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nel	If this tall, proud woman, this woman who was very particular about her friends, who slipped into church with unequaled elegance, who could quell a roustabout with a look, if she were really custard, then there was a chance that [MASK] was too.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Ivy	Maybe just a brief moment, for once, of not feeling fear, of looking at death in the sunshine and being unafraid. She laughed. Upstairs, [MASK] heard her and looked to see what caused the thick music that rocked her neighbor’s breasts.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Nel	Her voice was quiet and the stemmed rose over her eye was very dark. “It matters, [MASK], but only to you. Not to anybody else. Being good to somebody is just like being mean to somebody.
<name>French</name>	French	Creole	“Much handled things are always soft.” “What does ‘vwah’ mean?” “I don’t know,” her mother said. “I don’t talk [MASK].” She gazed at her daughter’s wet buttocks.
<name>My</name>, how time flies.	My, how time flies.	Lord	They should have known those silvery widows in the woods who would get up from the dinner table and walk into the trees with a customer with as much embarrassment as a calving mare. [MASK], how time flies. She hardly recognized anybody in the town any more.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Sula	Who made her laugh, who made her see old things with new eyes, in whose presence she felt clever, gentle and a little raunchy. [MASK], whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions.
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Helene	The conductor let his eyes travel over the pale yellow woman and then stuck his little finger into his ear, jiggling it free of wax. “What you think you doin’, gal?” [MASK] looked up at him. So soon. So soon.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Sula	Didn’t I count? I never hurt you. What did you take him for if you didn’t love him and why didn’t you think about me?” And then, “I was good to you, [MASK], why don’t that matter?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nel	Now git your butt on in there.” He stood there staring at her until she realized that he wanted her to move aside. Pulling [MASK] by the arm, she pressed herself and her daughter into the foot space in front of a wooden seat.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Shadrack	He closed his eyes to avoid seeing his hands and fumbled with the laces of the heavy high-topped shoes. The nurse had tied them into a double knot, the way one does for children, and [MASK], long unaccustomed to the manipulation of intricate things, could not get them loose.
<name>Anger</name>	Anger	Sula	Anger skipped but she realized that [MASK] was probably just showing off. No telling what shape she was really in, but there was no point in saying anything other than what was the truth. “I always understood how you could take a man.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Helene	Right here somewhere, sir...” The conductor looked at the bit of wax his fingernail had retrieved. “What was you doin’ back in there? What was you doin’ in that coach yonder?” [MASK] licked her lips. “Oh ... I...”
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Sula	By noon it was quiet. The deweys had escaped, [MASK] was either in her room or gone off somewhere. The newly married couple, energized by their morning lovemaking, had gone to look for a day’s work happily certain that they would find none.
<name>Bluebeard</name>	Bluebeard	Sula	The rest of the time, the time he was not watching his mother’s magic or thinking of airplanes, he spent in the idle pursuits of bachelors without work in small towns. He had heard all the stories about [MASK], and they aroused his curiosity.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sula	but the spreading of her lips until he saw it as a small miracle. [MASK] was no less excited about the wedding. She thought it was the perfect thing to do following their graduation from general school. She wanted to be the bridesmaid. No others.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sula	“Oh, come on. Is Medallion that bad?” “Didn’t nobody tell you?” “You been gone too long, [MASK].” “Not too long, but maybe too far.” “What’s that supposed to mean?”
<name>He</name>	He	Sula	And how much loam will 1 need to keep my water still? And when do the two make mud? He swallowed her mouth just as her thighs had swallowed his genitals, and the house was very, very quiet. ® ® ® [MASK] began to discover what possession was.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Plum	I’m all right. Didn’t I tell you? I’m all right. Go on, now.” “I’m going, [MASK],” she said. She shifted her weight and pulled her crutches toward her. Swinging and swooping, she left his room.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jude	“Well, there was this space in front of me, behind me, in my head. Some space. And [MASK] filled it up. That’s all. He just filled up the space.” “You mean you didn’t even love him?”
<name>person</name>	person	Jude	Without that someone he was a waiter hanging around a kitchen like a woman. With her he was head of a household pinned to an unsatisfactory job out of necessity. The two of them together would make one [MASK]. His fears lest his burst dream of road building discourage her were never realized.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eva	You doing the work for her too?” “Well, since you haven’t heard it, let me tell you. [MASK]’s real sick. I had her put where she could be watched and taken care of.” “Where would that be?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Ajax	This woman [MASK] loved, and after her—airplanes. There was nothing in between. And when he was not sitting enchanted listening to his mother’s words, he thought of airplanes, and pilots, and the deep sky that held them both.
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Hannah	And the fury she created in the women of the town was incredible—for she would lay their husbands once and then no more. [MASK] had been a nuisance, but she was complimenting the women, in a way, by wanting their husbands.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sula	Would be, in fact, the last to know. Talking to her about right and wrong was like talking to the deweys. She picked at the fringe on [MASK]’s bedspread and said softly, “We were friends.” “Oh, yes.
<name>Tramp</name>	Tramp	Shadrack	Further along the road [MASK] passed her by. A little shaggier, a little older, still energetically mad, he looked at the woman hurrying along the road with the sunset in her face. He stopped. Trying to remember where he had seen her before.
<name>Dewey</name>	Dewey	Eva	Slowly each boy came out of whatever cocoon he was in at the time his mother or somebody gave him away, and accepted [MASK]’s view, becoming in fact as well as in name a dewey—joining with the other two to become a trinity with a plural name . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Eva	That straw’ll tickle your pretty neck to death.” [MASK] listened to the wagon coming and thought about what it must be like in the icehouse. She leaned back a little and closed her eyes trying to see the insides of the icehouse.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Nellie	That place is a mess, you know. A doctor don’t never set foot in there. I ain’t figured out yet how they stay alive in there as long as they do.” “Why don’t I have the checks made over to you, [MASK]?
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Sula	She slashed off only the tip of her finger. The four boys stared open-mouthed at the wound and the scrap of flesh, like a button mushroom, curling in the cherry blood that ran into the corners of the slate. [MASK] raised her eyes to them.
<name>Yeah</name>	Yeah	Sho	A peck ain’t enough to can. He say he got two bushels for me.” “Triflin’.” “Oh, he all right.” “[MASK] he all right. Everybody all right. ’
<name>He</name>	He	Sula	“No. I guess it’s too late anyway. But let’s work out a plan for taking care of her. So she won’t be messed over.” “Anything you say.” “What about money? She got any?” [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Dessie	“That’s ’cause you saw it.” “Exactly.” “Devil all right.” “No two ways about it,” [MASK] said, and she popped the rubber band off the deck of cards to settle them down for a nice long game of bid whist.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Nel	[MASK] looked at her mother and then quickly back at the door they had just come out of. “No. That was your great-grandmother. This is your grandmother. My ... mother.” Before the child could think, her words were hanging in the gardenia air.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Hannah	They found her on her stomach by the for-sythia bushes calling [MASK]’s name and dragging her body through the sweet peas and clover that grew under the forsythia by the side of the house. Mother and daughter were placed on stretchers and carried to the ambulance.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Nel	Maybe I should have talked to you about it first. You always had better sense than me. Whenever I was scared before, you knew just what to do.” The closed place in the water spread before them. [MASK] put the iron on the stove.
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Shadrack	The sheriff looked through the bars at the young man with the matted hair. He had read through his prisoner’s papers and hailed a farmer. When [MASK] awoke, the sheriff handed him back his papers and escorted him to the back of a wagon.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Helene	A Frenchified shotgun house, it sported a magnificent garden in the back and a tiny wrought-iron fence in the front. On the door hung a black crepe wreath with purple ribbon. They were too late. [MASK] reached up to touch the ribbon, hesitated, and knocked.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Jude	For the first time in three years she would be looking at the stemmed rose that hung over the eye of her enemy. Moreover, she would be doing it with the taste of [MASK]’s exit in her mouth, with the resentment and shame that even yet pressed for release in her stomach.
<name>Sofia</name>	Sofia	Eva	“I heard one of ’em’s mamma came to take him back but didn’t know which was hern.” “Don’t nobody know.” “And [MASK]? You doing the work for her too?” “Well, since you haven’t heard it, let me tell you.
<name>Grasses</name>	Grasses	Grass	[MASK] stood blade by blade, shocked into separateness by an ice that held for days. Late-harvesting things were ruined, of course, and fowl died of both chill and rage. Cider turned to ice and split the jugs, forcing the men to drink their cane liquor too soon.
