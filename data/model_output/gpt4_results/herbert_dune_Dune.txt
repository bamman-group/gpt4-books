<name>Feyd-Rautha</name>	Feyd-Rautha	Paul	“Majesty,” [MASK] said, “your force is reduced by one more. Shall we now shed sham and pretense? Shall we now discuss what must be? Your daughter wed to me and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne.”
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Paul	“Let go of me,” he said. She heard the iron in his voice, obeyed. “Do you want to tell me what’s wrong, [MASK]?” “Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?” he asked.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jessica	He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders, handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife, began unstrapping his stillsuit. He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment. “There’s no need for this,” [MASK] said.
<name>Gregory</name>	Gregory	Yueh	Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is there around us that we cannot—’” “Stop it!” [MASK] barked.
<name>Muad'Dib</name>	Muad'Dib	MUAD'DIB	And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” What do you despise? By this are you truly known. — FROM "MANUAL OF [MASK]" BY THE PRINCESS iRULAN
<name>Asimov</name>	Asimov	Jessica	Could I____” “He is unconscious,” [MASK] said. “The processes of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. I shudder to think what could have happened had I not been the one to discover him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	His legs were remote and rubbery. They entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by spaced-out glowglobes. [MASK] felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him, opening time like a flower.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	And [MASK] knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them. He had not ridden the maker. Oh, he’d gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had not made his own voyage.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Paul	Did he need a wife? She realized she could step into that place with him. It would be one way to end conflict over tribal leadership-female properly aligned with male. But what of [MASK] then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed here?
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Stilgar	He says himself that he does not. Do I rule? Even [MASK] does my bidding on occasion, and the sages, the wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council.” There was shuffling silence among the crowd.
<name>Donatella</name>	Donatella	Jessica	She looked at him, said: “I do believe I’ll eat something now. I’d like some of that bird dish you served earlier.” [MASK] signaled a servant, turned to the banker: “And you, sir, were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits.
<name>Kynes</name>	Kynes	Idaho	“We’re already working on it, my Lord.” He cleared his throat. “Ah-h, [MASK] did say one thing: he said you couldn’t mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.”
<name>God</name>	God	Yueh	“The drug was timed,” he rumbled. “We knew to the minute when you’d be coming out of it.” How could that be? she wondered. They’d have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my.... [MASK]!
<name>Ryder</name>	Ryder	Paul	“I understand,” she said. “Ready?” “Ready.” She tensed her fingers on the strap. With one surge, [MASK] had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Paul	You press the edge—thus, and so... and the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate.” He closed the book, handed it to [MASK].
<name>He</name>	He	Paul	“Don’t you understand?” he asked. “Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand.” “You found me,” she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable. [MASK] squatted back on his heels.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Paul	[MASK] pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds of the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.
<name>Duncan</name>	Duncan	Paul	“Now I say guard yourself for true!” He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack. [MASK] fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his skin.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Nefud	Who else do I have who could take the reins I must leave someday? I have no other as capable. But he must learn! And I must preserve myself while he’s learning. [MASK] signaled men to assist him, led them out the door.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jessica	There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm’s doing. “Better set us down on sand,” [MASK] said. “The wings might not take full brake.” He nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes.
<name>country</name>	country	Fremen	But the test of a man isn’t what you think he’ll do. It’s what he actually does. These city people have [MASK] blood. It’s just that they haven’t yet learned how to escape their bondage. We’ll teach them.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	“Let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends,” she said, and [MASK] heard the soothers, the adjusting tones in her voice. “It’s over and we can be thankful we’ll never again have that sort of misunderstanding between us.”
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Paul	Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack. Could I have miscalculated? [MASK] asked himself. I’m the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	Then it was gone, coursing off to the left. The sound diminished, died. “I’ve seen space frigates that were smaller,” [MASK] whispered. She nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap.
<name>Kynes</name>	Kynes	Hawat	“This is a carryall,” [MASK] said. “It’s essentially a large ’thop-ter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Wellington	“If you’ll excuse me, [MASK], I want another look through this wing before I assign quarters.” He nodded. “Of course.” And he thought: If only there were sutne way not to do this thing that I must do.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Gurney	“Step back out of my way.” [MASK] spoke to her: “Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds his reason?”
<name>Swan</name>	Swan	Mapes	It makes no real difference.” “As you say, my Lady.” [MASK] stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head. “Killed an old duke, did you?” she crooned. “Shall I summon a handler to help you?”
<name>Kynes</name>	Kynes	Kynes	And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory. “The worm is now beneath the crawler,” [MASK] said. “You are about to witness a thing few have seen.” Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now.
<name>Arutha</name>	Arutha	Hawat	Again, he bent his head, listening. “They quarter the high country,” he said. “One wonders who they seek up there.” “It’s known that we retreated in this direction,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Jessica	[MASK] put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Oeyh	And he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this poor lad... though he does not know it. [MASK]! Damn those Har-konnen beasts! Why did they choose me for their abomination?
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Stilgar	[MASK] had asked him. And he had answered correctly: “Half a meter for every meter of the maker’s diameter.” “Why?” “To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount it.”
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Jessica	When [MASK] heard the true-banter in his voice, she allowed herself a faint hope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night. “Human, I warrant,” the man said.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	Around them, she recognized the cellar room where [MASK] had slept, saw his cot at one side—empty. Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jessica	The ’thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and [MASK] saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them. “This oughta be far enough,” the pilot said. “The traitor said to put ’em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.”
<name>Thrax</name>	Thrax	Tuek	He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by [MASK]’s aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Jessica	it’s important to me.” “Test?” He looked up at her. “Remember that you’re a duke’s son,” [MASK] said. She whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Sand	[MASK] rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A hole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Paul	She—” “You know nothing of it!” And [MASK], suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time, said only: “I don’t think you unnatural.” She saw his distress, said: “There is a thing, Son.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Jessica	[MASK] felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its deepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it. A splashing sounded on her left.
<name>Corwin</name>	Corwin	Gurney	“You will speak only when I permit it, witch,” [MASK] said. “I want only one thing from you for your son to hear it, and I am prepared to send this knife into your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter against me.
<name>Stilgar</name>	Stilgar	Paul	Shifting his hooks, [MASK] moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Paul	In spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest, this basin’s beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it. “Like a fairyland,” [MASK] whispered.
<name>Thufir</name>	Thufir	Hawat	He marked the way the man stood, loose and ready, muscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried [MASK]’s message to this one: “You’ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron.”
<name>Kynes</name>	Kynes	Gurney	Immediately the big factory crawler lurched off, swinging away from the ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand. A ’thopter swooped down nearby, skidded to a stop. Another followed and another. They disgorged [MASK]’s platoon and lifted to hover-flight.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	Why did he do this? [MASK] sat silently in the darkness, a single stark thought dominating his awareness: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Leto	To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could have built such a place? [MASK]? It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn’t been time. And he’s been busy with more serious problems.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Paul	“The place to hit them is in the spice,” [MASK] said. How can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself. “An entire planet full of spice,” she said. “How can you hit them there?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Paul	“I’ll eat in the officers’ mess at the field,” he said. “Don’t expect me until very late. And ... ah, I’ll be sending a guardcar for [MASK]. I want him to attend our strategy conference.”
<name>Piter</name>	Piter	Piter	“You killed the doctor too soon,” the Baron said. “That was a mistake. You should’ve warned me, [MASK]. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise.” He scowled. “Possibilities!”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	[MASK] swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. “Water’s precious there,” he said.
<name>Thufir</name>	Thufir	Hawat	“We must pursue other avenues for now,” [MASK] said. “The Guild agent wasn’t really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain—one Mentat to another—that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Hawat	Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs.” “Then we’ll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,” [MASK] said. “Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.” [MASK] took a deep breath to still his trembling. “If I call out there’ll be servants on you in seconds and you’ll die.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Jessica	She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer’s feminine companion—a tiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes. “You’ve hardly touched your dinner, my dear,” [MASK] said.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Thufir	And they fear the Duke’s failing them.” He stiffened. “Such talk from one of the men would be cause for—” “Oh, stop that, [MASK]. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly?
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	“Or our spice. You can be sure of that.” [MASK] glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled cushions.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Chani	He felt anew the hyperillumination with its high-relief imagery of time, sensed his future becoming memories— the tender indignities of physical love, the sharing and communion of selves, the softness and the violence. “You’re the strong one, [MASK],” he muttered.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Usui	“What is it you want to say?” he asked. “[MASK],” she whispered, and still she trembled. “You cannot back into the future,” he said. A profound compassion for her swept through him.
<name>Thufir</name>	Thufir	Gurney	One squad began investigating that no sly trap had been planted here. “I remember the day we first came here with your father,” [MASK] said. He glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. “I didn’t like this place then
<name>Stiva</name>	Stiva	Mankind	“[MASK] has ah only one mm-m-m science,” the Count said as they picked up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room—a narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Paul	“Steady pressure. We mustn’t break it.” More sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared the surface, [MASK] stopped, freed his mother from the sand. Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jessica	We know the need for cautious waiting, [MASK] thought, but there’s the core of our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do us. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting’s prolonged.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Paul	Leaving one hook in place, [MASK] released the other and planted it lower down the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first one, thus worked his way down the side.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	[MASK] stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force. They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Chani	It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was in itself a thing intrinsically of the past. [MASK] prepared the meal for me, he told himself.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Jessica	He nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner without turning: “Your son grew tired, [MASK]. I sent him into the next room to rest.” Abruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips.
<name>Theremon</name>	Theremon	Hawat	Shall I call him in and put him to the test?” “You know that’s an empty gesture,” [MASK] said. “He’s conditioned by the High College. That I know for certain.”
<name>Morgaine</name>	Morgaine	Sayyadina	“I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, I must be [MASK] and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the Chronicles.” She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then she had herself under control.
<name>Stilgar</name>	Stilgar	Stilgar	“You think it bad of me to say this now,” [MASK] said. “It is my duty. I think of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the maker would’ve turned toward you.”
<name>Chani</name>	Chani	Harah	The hangings parted and [MASK] seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch sandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders. Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an insect, flat and oily against her head.
<name>Stilgar</name>	Stilgar	Stilgar	“At this distance we’re just a worm on the surface,” [MASK] said. He motioned with his left hand. “Off. Scatter on the sand.” The troop began working down the worm’s sides, dropping off, blending with the sand beneath their cloaks.
<name>Stilgar</name>	Stilgar	Stilgar	She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within [MASK]’s troop. She turned in the hammock that had been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots.
<name>Yusuf</name>	Yusuf	Jamis	“It was [MASK]’ doing—he invoked the tahaddi al-burhan.” “He’s not but a boy!” she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from side to side, setting the water tallies to jingling.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Hawat	“What brought this base suspicion on me?” she asked. [MASK] frowned. “My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first loyalty is to the Duke.” “I’m prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty,” she said.
<name>Stilgar</name>	Stilgar	Paul	Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers. She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter. “Pass up the pack.” It was [MASK]’s voice, low and guarded.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kynes	He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him than it had been. [MASK] pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried flapping of wings. This is spice desert, he thought.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Paul	A dusty breeze touched [MASK]’s cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure. A wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Yueh	“The desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?” “And the storms.” “But any place can be made habitable.” “If it’s economically feasible,” [MASK] said.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Paul	Hiding like a child when I’m now the Duke, [MASK] thought. He felt the thought gall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did. Something had happened to his awareness this night—he saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	[MASK] glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently.
<name>Thufir</name>	Thufir	Hawat	Tell them I’ll ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. [MASK] here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount.” “What if the Emperor gets wind of this?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	He straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a man’s handreach. The troop spread out through shadows. [MASK] saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their companions.
<name>Ragnar</name>	Ragnar	Leto	[MASK] could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Jessica	[MASK] nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will... and, she admitted it: by the force of elation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed here about the Fremen culture.
<name>telepathic</name>	telepathic	Mentat	“It’s a mystery we’re not likely to solve. We’ve more immediate problems—among them: you.” “Me?” “Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have [MASK] capabilities.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Leto	In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds. Presently, she took a deep breath, said, “[MASK]’s right—these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house.”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Jessica	The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently. “Forgive me,” [MASK] said. “I did not mean to open an old wound.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jessica	It’s in the bloodstream—the urge to mingle genetic strains without plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood.” “CHOAM,” [MASK] muttered.
<name>Leto</name>	Leto	Paul	You think because I’m what you made me that I cannot feel the need for revenge?” “Even on the innocent?” she asked, and she thought: He must not make the mistakes I made. “There are no innocent anymore,” [MASK] said.
<name>Alanna</name>	Alanna	Gurney	He crossed to stand beside his mother, eye to eye with [MASK]. “Not prattle, but a thing that brings happiness between friends. I’d take it a kindness if you’d play for her now. Battle planning can wait a little while.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Jessica	Leave be, woman! We mean no harm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us, you’re worth ten times your weight of water.” Now, the test of reason, [MASK] thought.
<name>Kynes</name>	Kynes	Paul	“They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people,” [MASK] said. “I will stand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in the center of the room. They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I command otherwise.”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Halleck	He felt solemn with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He crossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away. “En garde!” [MASK] called, and the dummy pressed the attack.
<name>Bean</name>	Bean	Paul	He already has a good start in it, but we both know how much more he needs... and that desperately.” She stepped close to [MASK], stared down at him. “Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	“That’s what the old witches of your schools really want.” “I don’t understand you, [MASK],” his mother said. He remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Paul	It was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the moment. The voice came from above them and to their right. “Please do not run, intruders,” the voice said as [MASK] made to withdraw into the defile.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Paul	“What did you dream last night? Was it worth remembering?” “Yes.” [MASK] closed his eyes. “I dreamed a cavern... and water... and a girl there—very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in them.
<name>Hawat</name>	Hawat	Hawat	I should’ve suspected when you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?” [MASK]’s sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them.
