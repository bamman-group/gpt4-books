<name>Therapist</name>	Therapist	Mariama	The gentle waves of ebb tide washed quietly out of the bay. He pointed to a chair where I sat and he placed his chair directly before me. We sat face-to-face, knees touching. “[MASK] recognized that your presence was a positive influence.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Isaac	Out of anger and frustration, they burned out a commercial area, not caring about destroying some people’s hopes or memories.” [MASK] didn’t go along to see the riot area. Instead, he stayed at home and watched television with endless fascination.
<name>John</name>	John	Patsy	That’s been very satisfying and, for a long time, that was sufficient. Now it’s time for me to develop projects of my own.” “What do you have in mind?” [MASK]’s attentive manner elicited discussion of my new ambition.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Isaac	Terrified, I dashed down the hall and burst into his room where he was writhing on the floor beside his bed. In agony, his lean body was curled in the fetal position. He rolled from side to side shrieking. “[MASK], what is it?
<name>Akira</name>	Akira	Ibrahim	“I was hoping to see some of your films, [MASK]. You know, we’re not likely to get them back home. And I’d like to visit some small towns and villages, stay in a village for a few days.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Ibrahim	I wish I felt drawn to the baby. Tiny, frail thing. I am haunted by the dream of harming a baby. I could not touch him; I did not hold him when he was passed around. [MASK] was undemonstrative and reserved throughout the week.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Sarah	Ever yours, [MASK] I read the letter only once, sealed it in an airmail envelope marked “personal,” and affixed more than enough postage. I dashed out to the mailbox and dropped the letter in the slot before the courage to file my claim vanished.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Sarah	Then, in the condescending tone that she used when speaking to her third-grade pupils, she asked, “[MASK], dear, have you thought of seeing someone—a psychiatrist perhaps—about your plans and your—your Senegal problem?”
<name>Dr. Aziz</name>	Dr. Aziz	Ibrahim	A cloud of pungent odors hung in the sultry air. Ignoring the vendors’ cries, [MASK] and I hurried past the guard at the gate and up the steps into the gloom of the hospital. Beyond the foyer, we turned right onto a dimly lit corridor with gray-green walls.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	David	[MASK] and I stayed at the library until closing time nearly every night. After library hours, night after night we sat glumly over coffee at the Harvard Square Hayes-Bickford cafeteria, stirring each other’s anxieties about footnotes, deadlines, and letters lost in overseas mail.
<name>he</name>	he	Antonia	Two or three typically followed me to my office and invited me to a coffee shop where I enjoyed expanding on the lecture and rehearsing material for lectures to follow. The success of the course, [MASK] pointed out, “guarantees you security in the university—even if that doesn’t matter to you.”
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Ibrahim	“You are a beautiful bride,” said [MASK], placing in my hand a thong with a leather pendant encrusted with an engraved gold leaf seal and three cowrie shells. “In our tradition, there is no exchange of rings and kisses.
<name>He</name>	He	Ibrahim	I know that you will have such news for us one day, a baby of your own. For now, share our happy news. You must visit us after the baby is born. [MASK] sends his regards and best wishes in your work.
<name>He</name>	He	Ibrahim	“[MASK], do you recall who suggested these proposals?” I asked, waving the newspaper. “That’s partnership, my dear. And that is what sometimes happens with partners.” He smiled affectionately, reached for my hand, and kissed my palm.
<name>her</name>	her	Aisha	I asked. “With their families in the villages. Vacation.” “So we’re alone here. Very well.” It did not seem well at all. I was uneasy about being with [MASK]. She had an air of mystery that was disturbing.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Ibrahim	Relatives and friends followed his development and commented on his unusual alertness, energy, and effort. And, in every encounter, they remarked on his appearance. “He is just like [MASK].” “He is unquestionably his father’s son.”
<name>Wang Bing</name>	Wang Bing	Sarah	“[MASK], audiences are moved by sorrowful scenarios, not by success stories. Anyone can make simplistic documentaries about how a village feeds itself. In an artful way, I want to show how economic, political, and religious forces intersect in the drama of deteriorating village life.
<name>Kofi</name>	Kofi	Ibrahim	Instead, I summoned images of [MASK], his lips brushing mine, his sonorous voice, his touch. In a cloud of memories, I floated through the metallic corridors of the airport toward the Pan Am terminal, my blue batiked boubou undulating, a dozen braids on each shoulder.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Henry	In the course of our getting acquainted in his small but elegant living room amid a handsome collection of antiques or, as he insisted, “copies of copies of fine French antiques,” [MASK] said, “I’ve heard about your intervention at the conference.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Anna	Their child—a girl— had been weaned recently. [MASK], whose breasts were bulging with milk, said that she would enjoy caring for a boy. “And what will he be named?” I asked.
<name>Haruki</name>	Haruki	Ibrahim	“Of course, I understand. Didn’t I leave to come here? I understand the importance of finding the place where your soul wants to settle, living in a place where you can live with your true self. [MASK] used to call you our ‘American son.’
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Antonia	There was nothing personal in her living room—no photographs of relatives, evidence of pets, knitting or needlework, no playing cards, puzzles, or games, only a stack of back issues of the New York Times sug- gested that something other than scholarship claimed [MASK]’s time.
<name>Stagefright</name>	Stagefright	Flu	On the morning of the eighth of March, I awoke with a queasy stomach and an uneasy feeling about being on a podium in the midst of a crowd. I lay in bed inventing plausible excuses that might release me from the commitment. Upset stomach. [MASK].
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ibrahim	Purpose and passion are what I now desperately need. At one time, I wanted only a well-balanced relationship with [MASK]—with each of us sharing the world of the other completely. No more. It is no longer possible.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Susan	We spent hours in the Grand Bazaar haggling about the price of amber beads, gold bracelets, and silk. I wanted a suit made of Bursa silk. [MASK]’s dressmaker, who required several fittings, turned out an elegant mauve suit.
<name>son</name>	son	Isaac	I should have taken notes on everything you ever said.” “The most important words I have ever said to you, [MASK], are ‘I love you. I cherish you. I am proud of you as a son.’ ”
<name>Martha's</name>	Martha's	Martha	“I would rather share a page of fine writing than share a pillow.” His messages aroused pleasures and pains that sent me to [MASK]’s Vineyard to chant and splash in the icy waves that refreshed me and reinforced my resolve. 23 o N A CHILLY AFTERNOON IN LATE FEBRUARY
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mariama	She nestled the infant in the hollow between my breast and the arm that held the lightly breathing bundle of a boy. With the remembrance of my miscarriage, the memory of [MASK]’s death in the same hospital, and the overwhelming joy of holding my own child, my smiles soon gave way to tears.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Fatou	[MASK] wiggled to the edge of the seat and got to her feet. “Don’t call it a vacation—call it whatever you wish. But get out of this house for a while. This place has become a mausoleum of memories and regrets.”
<name>him</name>	him	Lincoln	We reveled in the company and conversation that whirled about us when we entered parties—I in my ruby velvet strapless sheath and [MASK] in a tuxedo with a ruby bow tie and cummerbund. That people fell in love with the image of us made us feel that we had fallen in love with each other.
<name>she</name>	she	Mariama	He had a director’s overview, noting the background and light, the tilt of one’s head, the exchange of glances, movements of hands—as if cameras were rolling and the scene were being filmed. After lunch, [MASK] turned to her gardening.
<name>his husband</name>	his husband	Ibrahim	My own words made me look at myself and think about my own potential authority.” “That’s progress. You spoke brilliantly. You were very brave. No references to [MASK] or what happened. You weren’t his widow yesterday. You were yourself.
<name>me</name>	me	Isaac	“Must you do it for [MASK]? I wonder. What about you—what must you do for yourself? You speak of obligations, expectations—what are your expectations for yourself? Your obligations to yourself?” “I’m beginning to think about those questions.”
<name>the name cannot be determined from the given context</name>	the name cannot be determined from the given context	Isaac	A hearse arrived with the caskets draped in green flannel mourning cloth. The bleating mob outside pushed against the gate. They fell silent when I walked toward them. I returned the nod of the imam who preceded the caskets, and looked beyond him, beyond the coffins, in search of [MASK].
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Mariama	“I don’t think I could share a man—a husband. It isn’t part of our tradition.” “Not part of your tradition, your fine American tradition?” [MASK], I realized, was capable of sarcasm.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Aisha	A bleak moment in history,” continued the guide. I found a shady corner, sat on the bare clay platform, and contemplated [MASK]’s questions. Who was she to confront me, and ask me to examine my personal life? She was curious and quite persistent.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Ibrahim	No more. It is no longer possible. [MASK] now has a world of his own and I must create mine! I must define my own purpose, realize my own dreams. Perhaps I am no longer possessed.
<name>Faulkner</name>	Faulkner	Ibrahim	In our discussions, I tried to elicit from him recollections of the incidents that had shaped the works. I began to concentrate on my own work, and on what I needed to extract from [MASK] and his library before leaving. From time to time, my concentration was interrupted.
<name>he</name>	he	Mariama	When [MASK] left the room, I opened the shutters, leaned on the wide windowsill, and looked out at a stone patio lit by a full moon. At the edge of the patio was an iron gate; and beyond the gate were giant boulders that appeared about to tumble into the bay.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Ibrahim	I packed a suitcase with a few essentials: white boubous, white slacks, and white shirts. I filled my jewelry case with gold bracelets, my necklace of gold and lapis lazuli, the heart-shaped pin with rubies and pearls, and other gifts from [MASK].
<name>the author</name>	the author	Isaac	They are calling for a new edition of the biography, so the author should be present, as well as her subject. You must come. I’ll need you there.” “[MASK] will be with you.
<name>He</name>	He	Ibrahim	My irritation, a residue of the festival treatment, was increasing. [MASK] was aware of my frustration, but refused to confront it. And I did not want to slow his progress with an argument over the sacrifices made by women in the interest of their husbands and lovers.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Sarah	[MASK]?” “Hello.” “Happy birthday.” Static on the line distorted his voice. “Did you receive my cable?” “Yes. How are you?” “I’ve been tired, very tired, and I’ve had morning sickness from time to time.
<name>the mother</name>	the mother	Anna	Her firm upturned breasts appeared to be a copious source of nourishment; the infant was no longer skinny and wrinkled. His arms and legs had filled out and his eyes were bright. When there was a pause in his suckling, [MASK] handed him over to me.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Anna	Streams of intense sunlight beamed around them. Immediately overhead, there was clear blue sky; but afar, in the east, there were menacing clouds and the rumble of distant thunder. Later in the day, [MASK] told me that thunder is an evil omen.
<name>Nature</name>	Nature	Allah	This time has been chosen for you to become a mother. We do not choose our time. The time of birth is [MASK]’s choice.” “You’re right, I’ll cable. He’ll need time to get accustomed to the idea.
<name>I</name>	I	Ibrahim	Together we determined what schools suited them best, which values we wished to instill, and where we would vacation with the children. In intellectual matters and artistic work, however, our partnership faltered. [MASK] began to draw inspiration and concepts from other sources.
<name>a literature laureate</name>	a literature laureate	Ibrahim	A portrait of the Nobel laureates and their families. A group picture with the nine laureates, nine smiling men—an economist, two chemists, three physicists, two physiologists, and [MASK]. Amid the multilingual babble of introductions and greetings, photographers positioned themselves discreetly for informal shots.
<name>the ambassador</name>	the ambassador	Ibrahim	Delighted by my hearty involvement in my new tasks, [MASK] observed, “The ambassador certainly has tapped the right person for this assignment. It needs the intelligence of a superb strategist—and that’s you. You could organize a coup, lead a revolution, save a continent!”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Mariama	[MASK] found me by the telephone in the semi-darkness of the great hall chanting and weeping. Warm tears streamed down my cheeks and gathered under my chin. She sat down and embraced me. “What has happened? What has gone wrong?”
<name>him</name>	him	Ibrahim	For the remainder of the afternoon and into the night, we talked about the festival. I had never seen [MASK] as excited about anything. His exhilaration was contagious. I was tingling at the prospect of meeting literary luminaries, opera stars, actors, dancers.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Ibrahim	I took my time, bathing, brushing, anointing, and admiring myself in the mirror, before slipping into a bridal boubou made of the same white brocade as [MASK]’s caftan, my braids swathed in a turban of the same material.
<name>Hillary</name>	Hillary	Ibrahim	“You have always been useful to a wide circle of friends and associates—a source of information, ideas, inspiration. And now you have expanded our circle, moved into a sphere of international organizers with important humanitarian projects. You have stepped into development work in an admirable way,” said [MASK].
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Antonia	“What are you wondering, [MASK]?” I ventured. “You’re devoted to each other’s ideas. You’re fascinated by what his mind does for yours and vice versa, but do you—can you—how can you love him?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lincoln	I didn’t comment on the resemblance or suggest that one’s first love is often a reflection of oneself. Delighted by her image, I merely said, “She is very, very beautiful. You make an attractive couple, I’m sure.” And I thought of [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Ibrahim	Still, I had bought a one-way ticket to an uncertain future and had left [MASK]’s post office box number as my forwarding address. I closed my eyes. The gyration of the plane rocked me to sleep.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Isaac	“Your handsome Yale man has returned! And what a political analyst he has become. He explained the U.S. elections brilliantly—better than the journalists.” [MASK] and I embraced. My depression was apparent to him. I went limp in his arms.
<name>Ms. Johnson</name>	Ms. Johnson	Mariama	[MASK] returned with chamomile tea. She sat on the bed and I at the writing table silently sipping the comforting brew. “The baby will make you and your husband very happy.” “Do you know what it takes to write a dissertation and complete graduate school?”
<name>BABY</name>	BABY	ISAAC	He enjoys nursing as much as I enjoy nursing him. Alert and responsive, he is a joy. We have been blessed. Mashallah! 35 r: ARRIVAL OF [MASK] DREW ME INTO THE nursery and the kitchen more frequently.
<name>Señor</name>	Señor	Ibrahim	I sat on the sofa. Looking over crescent-shaped reading glasses, he said, “Call me [MASK]. Use tu instead of vom. After all, you are our guest and I understand you are to be with us for three months.
<name>Mariama</name>	Mariama	Mariama	Relatives bring us news of her.” Curious about Senegalese marital customs, I asked, “Is it still common for a man to have more than one wife?” “It is not uncommon,” said [MASK].
<name>Camus</name>	Camus	Ibrahim	One does not become wiser upon receiving the prize, but one has to sound wiser.” [MASK] put on his reading glasses and opened his notebook. “Reporters will ask you about your plans for the prize money.” “Twelve hundred thousand francs,” he said and whistled.
<name>Césaire</name>	Césaire	Senghor	Until that moment, my reading of [MASK]’s essays on Negritude had been merely an intellectual exercise. I looked about me and felt the connection between the spirit of my African fellow travelers and the soul that animates African-American culture.
<name>the father</name>	the father	Ibrahim	The delivery process was, indeed, very hard work, the work of bringing into our world a robust 3.8-kilo boy. Exhausted and elated, I then rested. A nurse swaddled the baby and presented the bundle to [MASK], who was dazzled by the warmth and weight of his second son.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lincoln	And I need to think more, too. Then we’ll decide what to do. I know it must be hard all alone there, so take care of yourself. And try to be of good cheer. Good-bye.” With a click, [MASK] was gone.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Lord	“Did you know that you were going the whole time you were with us at the beach?” “No, it wasn’t until after vacation that I received a cable inviting me to come and—” “Oh, [MASK], from that writer!
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Sarah	I can’t wait to see you—to be with you. Tell the front desk you are checking out. I will be there within the hour. [MASK], I love you. I love only you. I’ve missed you very much.”
<name>Chinua</name>	Chinua	Mamadou	Initially, I merely answered “yes” or “no.” Gradually, I realized that he truly wanted to engage me in a discussion of his work; gradually, I became more responsive, asking him to provide more information for readers unacquainted with village customs. [MASK] brought midmorning tea.
<name>Achebe</name>	Achebe	Sarah	I haven’t written anything of consequence since the publication of my book.” “It’s a pity, [MASK]. The vantage point you have on African writing is unique. You’re uniquely positioned to analyze African Francophone and Anglophone literature. You’re surrounded by it.”
<name>him</name>	him	Lincoln	It was obvious that he wasn’t interested, but it didn’t matter. I told [MASK] that I had to go home to review my lecture material. He offered to walk me to my car, but I declined. I didn’t wish to be in his company any longer.
<name>the baby's name</name>	the baby's name	Ibrahim	He’ll be thrilled. We’re happy for you and [MASK]. We really are happy about the way your life is going. We love you very much. We’ll come over again after the baby’s born.”
<name>Jamaica</name>	Jamaica	Senegal	In response, I delivered a lively overview of [MASK]’s colonial past and post-Independence political climate to a party of unconcerned, uninterested individuals who had come only for bridge and bourbon. My lecture did not engage them in the least.
<name>Chamcha</name>	Chamcha	Amadon	“Come,” he whispered to me, “they are eager to see the bride.” He led me to the courtyard where the throng greeted us with applause and shouts. [MASK] escorted us to rattan thronelike seats. Then the music began.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Ibrahim	Barely containing the flood of embarrassment’s feverish tears, I sank between the pillows on the couch feeling sopho-moric. [MASK] swiveled around, his back to me, and occupied himself with the mail for several minutes. Then he spun around and looked at me with compassion.
<name>Cleopatra</name>	Cleopatra	Fate	[MASK] made this place your destination. I sensed it when we met. There was an air of mystery about your arrival and about you.” His mood had changed. He was smiling broadly. “And then your elegance, your exquisite beauty, your intensity, your intelligence entranced us.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Ousmane	“When it happened? I was at Place du Puits-de-l’Ermite in the tea room of the Grand Mosque. [MASK] was to have met me there. Now I am at a police station where I must sign some papers.”
<name>Kaczynski</name>	Kaczynski	Ousmane	The officer in charge said that [MASK] and a friend had made a small bomb, which they had detonated that morning at the entrance of the U.S. Information Agency library, and while no one had been injured, several windows were shattered by the explosion.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Bill	I was elated. “Close your eyes, make a wish, and blow out the candles,” [MASK] instructed. With one long breath, I blew out all twenty-six candles, the extra one for good luck. My high spirits were extinguished with the flames.
<name>Dr. Edmonds</name>	Dr. Edmonds	Mariama	It’s a bad time for—” “If I understand your situation,” [MASK] said softly, “you must tell your husband immediately. Telephone him or cable him at once. He will probably surprise you—he’ll be proud and happy, no doubt.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Lincoln	I remember that it was a bright, balmy May day. The legal transaction had cleared the air. Our lawyers shook hands with us in the lobby of the courthouse and then rushed away to meet other clients. Outside on the steps, [MASK] and I also shook hands.
<name>My friend</name>	My friend	Ibrahim	In his conversation with us, the investigator treated the incident lightly; he dismissed the episode as merely “an amateurish schoolboy prank.” [MASK] and I, however, felt the investigator should have been more severe. Certainly, we were alarmed.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Antonia	Without a word, [MASK] got up and went over to the file cabinet for the Dry Sack sherry and fluted glasses. She poured us each a glass. We lifted them in a silent toast. “Tell me more about your plans,” she said.
<name>Mahatma</name>	Mahatma	Lincoln	While [MASK] slept, I lay awake wondering whether the energy of prayer converts dreams into realities. In the dark of a sleepless night, I invented a prayer—a variation on a psalm I had memorized years earlier for a Methodist Sunday school class.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Bill	Instead, I said, “My friends who participate in the march will tell me all about it.” [MASK] signaled the maitre d’hotel, who had a waiter bring a pink frosted cake with lighted candles. In their accented English, everyone joined him in singing “Happy Birthday.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Mamadou	He will stamp your passport and clear your baggage, and then [MASK] will collect it later and take it to the hotel where I made a reservation for you. The house is not—well, you will be more comfortable at a hotel for now.
<name>he</name>	he	Lincoln	How’s your health?” “Just fine,” I said. I had not told them that I was pregnant; and I assumed that [MASK] hadn’t told his parents either. “I feel fine,” I repeated, as much to reassure myself as her.
<name>Miss Quested</name>	Miss Quested	Mangane	And [MASK] is very busy—occupied with—” “You see, she wants to go to see somebody who may not even exist! Some kind of African juju has possessed her.” His characteristic reserve fell away. He grew agitated. “Will I go with her?
<name>duke</name>	duke	Manganes	In the bathroom across the hall, I showered hurriedly, dressed in my coral linen sheath dress and sandals, and retraced the labyrinthine route to the great hall, where I paused to admire its stately dimensions and the [MASK]’ magnificent art collection.
<name>Camus</name>	Camus	Antonia	I explained that he acknowledged the influence of French culture; after all, much of his work was written originally in French. He seemed to value the interaction of Senegalese and French intellectuals. Aside from the sherry hours with [MASK], I had few contacts of a personal nature at the university.
<name>her</name>	her	Awa	Being with us, she said, would improve her French; and I told her that I hoped that she would help me with my Wolof. I was pleased by [MASK]’s candor and competent manner, which completely won my confidence.
<name>John</name>	John	Mamadou	We’ll not be bothered. I’ll no longer be a target.” He sounded tired and looked preoccupied. While he dressed and packed, I spoke with [MASK] about making the compound more secure, reminding him not to admit repairmen or strangers.
<name>MLK</name>	MLK	King	You’ve missed the most important event in this country since the Civil War.” “I saw a television program on the March and I read [MASK]’s speech. It must have been—” “TV can’t begin to convey the spirit of the March.
<name>Africans</name>	Africans	Americans	I expect some Europeans and [MASK] find the human aspects familiar—that they see beyond skin color, physiognomy, style of dress. I hope they, too, see themselves and their situations from a new point of view. P.M.:
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Mariama	I really haven’t missed him or had the urge to be with him.” “And that troubles you?” “Yes, because I’m—I’m pregnant and—” I was trembling. “I know you are pregnant. [MASK] told me—and your lovely, drowsy eyes told me.”
<name>he</name>	he	Ibrahim	When there are no reporters inquiring about my opinion, then I am concerned.” “Why are you hungry for their attention? You’ve become media hungry.” He protested that he was not hungry for attention. “I am hungry for the truth,” [MASK] corrected.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Ibrahim	“He’s suspicious, distrustful, and mysterious. He doesn’t even trust me. I think he’s become sort of paranoid about political matters. A political paranoia that—” [MASK] interrupted, “Political paranoia! Are you studying psychology this semester, son?”
<name>Momzilla</name>	Momzilla	Ousmane	I wanted to ask her. The ingredients of her own recipe for motherhood had included a cup of criticism, a large jar of judgment, a dash of cynicism, and a pinch of praise. I wanted enthusiastic approbation for my style of mothering [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ousmane	We had settled in on the divan in the great hall and I had begun the story. [MASK] interrupted to say that his cousins had told him that I was going to have a baby and that he was not my child.
<name>Dickie</name>	Dickie	Ibrahim	From the divan where she sat, she viewed the masks and musical instruments on the walls. “You’re obviously fond of your stepson, and [MASK] appears to be devoted to you—I hope as devoted to you as you are to him. Still one wonders.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Dorothy	Slowly, around a heavy tongue, she talked. “So I’m not writing just yet. I am reading, though. I seem to be steadily recovering. Soon I hope to be able to write— to use this hand and type again—like [MASK].
