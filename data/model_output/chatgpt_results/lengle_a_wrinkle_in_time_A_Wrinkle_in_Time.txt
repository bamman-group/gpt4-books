<name>Conor</name>	Conor	Meg	[MASK] asked. She tried to look around, but all she could see was shadows. Nevertheless there was a sense of openness, a feel of a gentle breeze moving lightly about, that kept the darkness from being oppressive. Perplexity came to her from the beast.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Charles	I’m going up to kiss [MASK] and then I have to see that the twins get to bed.” Outdoors the grass was wet with dew. The moon was halfway up and dimmed the stars for a great arc.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Calvin	Every once in a while the postmistress makes some kind of a crack about all her letters.” “I suppose they think she’s pursuing him or something,” [MASK] said, rather bitterly. “They can’t understand plain, ordinary love when they see it.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Meg	“Different how?” “I’m not quite sure. You know yourself he’s not like anybody else.” “No. And I wouldn’t want him to be,” [MASK] said defensively. “Wanting doesn’t have anything to do with it.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Mary	“Its fleece was white as snow!” “Once four is four. Once five is five. Once six is six.” “And everywhere that [MASK] went the lamb was sure to go!” “Once seven is seven. Once eight is eight.
<name>me</name>	me	Calvin	“You’ve studied atoms in school, haven’t you?” “Sure, but—” “Then you know enough to know that matter isn’t solid, don’t you? That you, [MASK], consist mostly of empty space?
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Meg	And we want to see him, please. Right now.” “My, but the little miss is impatient! Patience, patience, young lady.” [MASK] did not tell the man on the chair that patience was not one of her virtues.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Calvin	Can’t you try to communicate with him? Can’t you try to get in to him?” “Golly day, you’re right.” [MASK]’s face lit up with hope, and his eyes, which had been somber, regained their usual sparkle.
<name>Watt</name>	Watt	Perspective	In spite of the enormous width of the room it was even longer than it was wide. [MASK] made the long rows of machines seem almost to meet. The children walked down the center of the room, keeping as far from the machines as possible.
<name>him</name>	him	Charles	“Wwhatt ddoo yyou unndderrsstanndd?” “That it has to be me. It can’t be anyone else. I don’t understand [MASK], but he understands me. I’m the one who’s closest to him.
<name>They</name>	They	Meg	Each clapped. Each child with the ball caught the ball. Each child with the skipping rope folded the rope. Each child turned and walked into the house. The doors clicked shut behind them. “How can they do it?” [MASK] asked wonderingly.
<name>Ursula</name>	Ursula	Meg	“Well, we can’t see without it,” [MASK] said, realizing that she was completely unable to explain vision and light and dark. How can you explain sight on a world where no one has ever seen and where there is no need of eyes?
<name>Dr. Jekyll</name>	Dr. Jekyll	Meg	“I have to find out what he really is. You know that. I’m going to try to hold back. I’m going to try to keep part of myself out. You mustn’t stop me this time, [MASK].”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Meg	“Maybe IT’s right about you! Or maybe you’re in league with IT. I’m the one to go if anybody goes! Why did you bring me along at all? To take care of [MASK]! You said so yourself!”
<name>Miss Stacy</name>	Miss Stacy	Meg	“Well,” [MASK] said, “when we are turned toward the sun—our earth, our planet, I mean, toward our sun— we receive its light. And when we’re turned away from it, it is night.
<name>Assistant</name>	Assistant	Calvin	Her body was still stone, but her mind was beginning to be capable of movement. She tried desperately to make some kind of a sound, a signal to them, but nothing happened. Their voices started again. [MASK]: “About your project, sir.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Camazotz	“I’m frozen—” she said faintly. [MASK] hadn’t been this cold, a cold that cut deeper than the wind on the bitterest of winter days at home. She was away from IT, but this unexplained iciness was almost as bad.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Charles	The heart has its reasons, whereof reason knows nothing.” “But that’s not appropriate at all,” [MASK] said crossly. “Your mother would find it so.” A smile seemed to gleam through the roundness of spectacles.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Calvin	“Tell me,” the beast said. “What do you suppose you’d do if three of us suddenly arrived on your home planet.” “Shoot you, I guess,” [MASK] admitted. “Then isn’t that what we should do with you?”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Dennys	“You don’t have to take everything so personally. Use a happy medium, for heaven’s sake. You just goof around in school and look out the window and don’t pay any attention.” “You just make things harder for yourself,” [MASK] said.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Charles	Of course you’ll know him! The way you’d know me even without looking because I’m always there for you, you can always reach in—” “Yes.” [MASK] punched one small fist into an open palm with a gesture of grest decision.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Calvin	“There was something funny about the way he talked, as though—well, as though he weren’t really doing the talking. Know what I mean?” [MASK] nodded, thoughtfully. “Funny is right. Funny peculiar. Not only the way he talked, either.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Meg	We like to walk in the woods, and suddenly he took off after a squirrel and I took off after him and we ended up by the haunted house, so I met them by accident, as you might say.” “But nobody lives there,” [MASK] said.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Charles	Maybe there’s another way to get in.” “Let’s try knocking anyhow,” [MASK] said. He raised his hand, but before he touched the door it slid up from the top and to each side, splitting into three sections that had been completely invisible a moment before.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Meg	“Well, now. First, try not to say any words for just a moment. Think within your own mind. Think of all the things you call people, different kinds of people.” While [MASK] thought, the beast murmured to her gently.
<name>Buckbeak</name>	Buckbeak	Hank	We know [MASK] went. We saw him go. We saw him vanish right in front of the rest of us. He was there and then he wasn’t. We were to wait for a year for his return or for some message. We waited.
<name>Meggie</name>	Meggie	Meg	The CENTRAL Central Intelligence Building loomed up, stark and angular, behind them. —Do something, [MASK] implored her father silently. —Do something. Help. Save us. They turned a corner, and at the end of the street was a strange, domelike building.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Meg	“Listen, you go right on wearing your glasses. I don’t think I want anybody else to see what gorgeous eyes you have.” [MASK] smiled with pleasure. She could feel herself blushing and she wondered if the blush would be visible in the moonlight.
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Meg	“She told us to stay together. She told us not to go off by ourselves.” “She told you not to go off by yourself. I’m the oldest and I should go in first.” “No.” [MASK]’s voice was flat.
<name>she</name>	she	Meg	“Yes,” she answered. “Now let us just stand and get our breath and look around.” They were standing on a hill and as [MASK] looked about her she felt that it could easily be a hill on earth.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Charles	When she reached for him her fingers touched nothing. She screamed out, “[MASK]!” and whether it was to help him or for him to help her, she did not know. The word was flung back down her throat and she choked on it.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Aunt	Not just friend, nor teacher, nor brother, nor sister. What is acquaintance? What a funny, hard word. [MASK]. Maybe. Yes, perhaps that will do. And you think of such odd words about me. Thing, and monster!
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Calvin	But this time she was prepared for the sudden and complete dissolution of her body. When she felt the tingling coming back to her fingertips she knew that this journey was almost over and she could feel again the pressure of [MASK]’s hand about hers.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Calvin	“But there isn’t a door or anything,” [MASK] said. “How do we get in?” “You put your S papers in the B slot,” the man said. “Why are you asking me these stupid questions?
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Meg	“I’ll tell you how to use them later.” As [MASK] took her flower she realized that it was not a single blossom, but hundreds of tiny flowerets forming a kind of hollow bell. “Where are we going?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Meg	“I do face facts,” [MASK] said. “They’re lots easier to face than people, I can tell you.” “Then why don’t you face facts about your father?” “You leave my father out of it!”
<name>Mr. Tumnus</name>	Mr. Tumnus	Charles	Six large doors kept swinging open, shut, open, shut, as people went in and out, in and out, looking straight ahead, straight ahead, paying no attention to the children whatsoever, whatsoever. [MASK] wore his listening, probing look.
<name>John</name>	John	Meg	the principal asked. “Now, [MASK], I’m convinced that you can do the work and keep up with your grade if you will apply yourself, but some of your teachers are not. You’re going to have to do something about yourself.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Meg	One whitefaced man in a dark suit looked directly at the children, said, “Oh, dear, I shall be late,” and flickered into the building. “He’s like the white rabbit,” [MASK] giggled nervously.
<name>drive</name>	drive	Meg	No matter how slowly her feet had taken her at the end, they had taken her there. Directly ahead of her was the circular building, its walls glowing with violet flame, its silvery roof pulsing with a light that seemed to [MASK] to be insane.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Charles	The man looked at the children warily. “The procedure for what?” “How do we see whoever’s in authority?” [MASK] asked. “You present your papers to the A machine. You ought to know that,” the man said severely.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Calvin	The rhythm of the gesture never varied. The paper flew in identically the same arc at each doorway, landed in identically the same spot. It was impossible for anybody to throw with such consistent perfection. [MASK] whistled. “I wonder if they play baseball here?”
<name>Einstein</name>	Einstein	Einstein	“What’s E = me2?” “[MASK]’s equation.” “What’s E stand for?” “Energy.” “m?” “Mass.” «c2?>> “The square of the velocity of light in centimeters per second.”
<name>him</name>	him	Calvin	“I don’t want to make anything of [MASK]. I like him very much, and I’m delighted he’s found his way here.” “Mother, you were going to tell me about a tesser-act.” “Yes.”
<name>Templeton</name>	Templeton	Calvin	Nobody has weeks and weeks of runny noses and sore throats. Rather than endure such discomfort they are simply put to sleep.” “You mean they’re put to sleep while they have a cold, or that they’re murdered?” [MASK] demanded.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Meg	“The virtue is gone from them. And what I have to give you this time you must try to understand not word by word, but in a flash, as you understand the tesseract. Listen, [MASK]. Listen well.
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Meg	“But I’m not patient!” [MASK] cried passionately. “I’ve never been patient!” ‘Mrs. Who’s glasses shone at her gently. “If you want to help your father then you must learn patience.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Calvin	The outskirts anyhow. I want to know more about this. I have a hunch it may help us later. You go on if you don’t want to come with me.” “No,” [MASK] said firmly. “We’re going to stay together.
<name>Mr. Punch</name>	Mr. Punch	Murry	Then his whole body twirled wildly, and went rigid. He started his marionette’s walk again. “I should have known better,” he said. “If you want to see [MASK] you’d better come with me and not try any more hanky-panky.”
<name>Mr. Tumnus</name>	Mr. Tumnus	Calvin	[MASK] rose to his feet. He bowed to the beasts as though they could see him. He said, “How do you do, sir—ma’am—?” “Who are you?” the tallest of the beasts said.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Calvin	“Well, then, someone just tell me how we got here!” [MASK]’s voice was still angry and his freckles seemed to stand out on his face. “Even traveling at the speed of light it would take us years and years to get here.”
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Calvin	I have to acknowledge quite openly that it may be a fatal danger. I know this. But I do not believe it. And the Happy Medium doesn’t believe it, either.” “Can’t she see what’s going to happen?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Calvin	[MASK] exclaimed. “We’ve never had any, as far as I know.” “Why?” “I don’t know.” The middle beast, a tremor of trepidation in his words, said, “You aren’t from a dark planet, are you?”
<name>he</name>	he	Meg	He stumped down the steps. After several blocks the houses gave way to apartment buildings; at least [MASK] felt sure that that was what they must be. They were fairly tall, rectangular buildings, absolutely plain, each window, each entrance exactly like every other.
<name>Orion</name>	Orion	Meg	He was, [MASK]’s father had decided, part Llewellyn setter and part greyhound, and he had a slender, dark beauty that was all his own. “Why didn’t you come up to the attic?”
<name>The Man with Red Eyes</name>	The Man with Red Eyes	Meg	[MASK] said. “I am merely trying to teach you to stay on your toes, I warn you, if I have any more trouble from either of you, I shall have to take you to IT.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Calvin	It hasn’t just come. It has been there for a great many years. That is why your planet is such a troubled one.” “But why—” [MASK] started to ask, his voice croaking hoarsely.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Meg	“[MASK], you’re supposed to have some mind. Why do you think we have wars at home? Why do you think people get confused and unhappy? Because they all live their own, separate, individual lives.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Meg	And suddenly the wall was no longer there and they were looking into an enormous room lined with machines. They were not unlike the great computing machines [MASK] had seen in her science books and that she knew her father sometimes worked .with.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Calvin	This gesture of tenderness undid her completely, and she put her head down on her knees and sobbed. [MASK] sat quietly beside her, every once in a while patting her head. “I’m sorry,” she sobbed finally. “I’m terribly sorry.
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Charles	“Okay,” [MASK] said. “What is the first dimension?” “Well—a line:--------” “Okay. And the second dimension?” “Well, you’d square the line. A flat square would be in the second dimension.”
<name>Miss Stacy</name>	Miss Stacy	Meg	I think I get it. Show me once more on another one.” Again [MASK]’s pencil was busy. “All you have to remember is that every ordinary fraction can be converted into an infinite periodic decimal fraction. See? So 3/7 is 0.428571.”
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Calvin	Can’t we look for help? Do we just have to go on waiting?” Her father: “We can’t leave her. And we must stay together. We must not be afraid to take time.” [MASK]: “You mean we were?
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Meg	“Things are going to happen, [MASK]! Good things! I feel it!” He began wandering, still slowly, around the pleasant, if shabby, living room. He stopped before a picture on the piano of a small group of men standing together on a beach.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Charles	“I don’t think we should eat this stuff, but if you’re going to, I’d better, too.” She took a mouthful. “It tastes all right. Try some of mine, [MASK].” She held out a forkful of turkey.
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Calvin	This is a two-dimensional planet and the children can’t manage here!” > She was whizzed into nothingness again, and nothingness was wonderful. She did not mind that she could not feel [MASK]’s hand, that she could not see or feel or be.
<name>Mrs. Phelps</name>	Mrs. Phelps	Meg	“No! They’d have told us if he were dead! There’s always a telegram or something. They always tell you!” “What do they tell you?” [MASK] choked down a sob, managed to speak over it.
<name>Deirdre</name>	Deirdre	Meg	“Everything’s fine at home.” “I’m glad to hear it. But I know it must be hard on you to have your father away.” [MASK] eyed the principal warily, and ran her tongue over the barbed line of her braces.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Calvin	Then he shoved with his middle finger at his nose as though he were trying to get spectacles closer to his eyes. “Are you remembering that she is only a child?” “And she’s backward,” [MASK] bellowed.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Calvin	Look, do me a favor, both of you. Let’s not talk about it till we’ve had something to eat. I need fuel so I can sort things out and assimilate them properly.” “Lead on, moron,” [MASK] cried gaily.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Calvin	They were fairly tall, rectangular buildings, absolutely plain, each window, each entrance exactly like every other. Then, coming toward them down the street, was a boy about [MASK]’s age riding a machine that was something like a combination of a bicycle and a motorcycle.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Meg	But we aren’t going to have the faintest idea where or how to begin to look for him until we find out something more about this place, and I have a hunch that that’s the place to start. If you have a better idea, [MASK], why of course just say so.”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Meg	“New?” “Yes. That’s what your father and I feel.” [MASK] twisted her pencil so hard that it broke. She laughed. “I’m sorry. I’m really not being destructive. I’m just trying to get things straight.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Meg	I should be able to control myself.” “Your mother’s a completely different person and she’s a lot older than you are.” “I wish I were a different person,” [MASK] said shakily. “I hate myself.”
<name>Mordor</name>	Mordor	Meg	It will do you good to stretch your legs a little.” As they moved through the grayness [MASK] caught an occasional glimpse of slaglike rocks, but there were no traces of trees or bushes, nothing but flat ground under their feet, no sign of any vegetation at all.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Meg	Yyou hhave ssomethinngg thatt ITT hhass nnott. Thiss ssomethinngg iss yyourr onlly wweapponn. Bbutt yyou mmusstt ffinndd itt fforr yyourrssellff.” Then the voice ceased, and [MASK] knew that she was alone. She walked slowly down the hill, her heart thumping painfully against her ribs.
<name>Biff</name>	Biff	Meg	“They’re lots easier to face than people, I can tell you.” “Then why don’t you face facts about your father?” “You leave my father out of it!” [MASK] shouted.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Calvin	Now that you’ve come I have some hope that I may be able to return in time. One thing I have to tell the others is that we know nothing.” [MASK]: “What do you mean, sir?” Her father: “Just what I say.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Meg	“So’m I.” [MASK] held his hand more tightly. “Come on.” They stepped into the room with the machines. In spite of the enormous width of the room it was even longer than it was wide.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Meg	During lunch she’d rough-housed a little to try to make herself feel better, and one of the girls said scornfully, “After all, [MASK], we aren’t grammar-school kids any more. Why do you always act like such a baby?”
<name>she</name>	she	Meg	And how anybody after one look at your mother could believe any man would leave her for another woman just shows how far jealousy will make people go. Right?” “I guess so,” [MASK] said, but her happiness had fled and she was back in a morass of anger and resentment.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Meg	Her mouth was open and [MASK] could see the toothless gums and it seemed that she could almost hear her screaming at two small children who were standing by her. Then she grabbed a long wooden spoon from the sink and began whacking one of the children.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Meg	They were headed directly toward the center of the galaxy; then they moved off to one side; stars seemed to be rushing at them. [MASK] flung her arm up over her face as though to ward off the blow. “Llookk!”
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Meg	Up in one of the elms an old black crow gave its raucous cry, and a woodpecker went into a wild ratatattat. A large gray rat scuttled around the comer of the house and [MASK] let out a stifled shriek.
<name>Bianca</name>	Bianca	Meg	Sometimes we can’t know what spiritual damage it leaves even when physical recovery is complete.” [MASK] looked angrily around the table. The beasts sat there, silent, motionless. She felt that she was being measured and found wanting.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Cal	[MASK]. We have to stay together. Suppose you didn’t come out and we had to go in after you? Unh-unh. Come on. But let’s hold hands if you don’t mind.” Holding hands, they crossed the square.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charles	The trouble is that these boots are a mite too tight for me, and I never can take them off by myself.” “I’ll help you,” [MASK] offered. “Not you. You’re not strong enough.” “I’ll help.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Meg	Her father: “Just what I say. We’re children playing with dynamite. In our mad rush we’ve plunged into this before—” With a desperate effort [MASK] made a sound. It wasn’t a very loud sound, but it was a sound.
<name>Dr. Larch</name>	Dr. Larch	Meg	“I think I feel a pulse in her wrist now.” [MASK] could not feel his fingers against her wrist. She could not feel her wrist at all. Her body was still stone, but her mind was beginning to be capable of movement.
<name>it</name>	it	Meg	She’s terribly cold. We think that’s why she can’t move.” One of them came up to [MASK] and squatted down on its huge haunches beside her, and she felt utter loathing and revulsion as it reached out a tentacle to touch her face.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Meg	Sure, I can function on the same level as everybody else, I can hold myself down, but it isn’t me.” [MASK] took a batch of forks from the drawer and turned them over and over, looking at them. “I’m all confused again.”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Meg	WHO When [MASK] woke to the jangling of her alarm clock the wind was still blowing but the sun was shining; the worst of the storm was over. She sat up in bed, shaking her head to clear it. It must have been a dream.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Meg	“I’ve heard that clever people often have subnormal children,” [MASK] had once overheard. “The two boys seem to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive girl and the baby boy certainly aren’t all there.”
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Meg	But I did blink, [MASK] tried to tell them. I’m sure I did. And I can hear you! Do something! But there was only another long silence, during which perhaps they were looking at her, watching for another shadow, another flicker.
<name>Aunt Dahlia</name>	Aunt Dahlia	Charles	“I think it’s sprained. A little oil of cloves mixed well with garlic is rather good.” And she took a large bite of sandwich. “Do please get up,” [MASK] said. “I don’t like to see you lying there that way.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Meg	For a moment her brain reeled with confusion. Then came a moment of blazing truth. “No!” she cried triumphantly. “Like and equal are not the same thing at all!” “Good girl, [MASK]!” her father shouted at her.
<name>Mattie</name>	Mattie	Calvin	“You will need help,” she told them, “but all I am allowed to give you is a little talisman. [MASK], your great gift is your ability to communicate, to communicate with all kinds of people. So, for you, I will strengthen this gift.
<name>Mrs. Hutchinson</name>	Mrs. Hutchinson	Calvin	And each time the ball bounced he screamed as though he were in pain. “That’s the little boy we saw this afternoon,” [MASK] said sharply, “the little boy who wasn’t bouncing the ball like the others.”
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Meg	His voice was neither hostile nor welcoming, and it came not from the mouthlike indentation in the furry face, but from the waving tentacles. —They’ll eat us, [MASK] thought wildly.—They’re making me hurt. My toes—my fingers—I hurt. . . .
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Calvin	Her father’s words sounded brittle in her ears, as though they were being chipped out of ice. [MASK]: “Yes. You’re right, sir.” She wanted to call out to them. “I’m alive! I’m very much alive!
