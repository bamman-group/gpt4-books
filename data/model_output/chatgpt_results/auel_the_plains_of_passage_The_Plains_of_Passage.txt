<name>Nightmare</name>	Nightmare	Creb	“It’s all right,” he said, holding her. “It must have been a terrible dream. You were shouting and crying. Do you think it would help if you told me?” “It was [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Creb	She ran after him, trying to catch up with him, until she came to a fork, but she didn't know which branch [MASK] had taken. She was in a panic, looking at one and then the other.
<name>Conchita</name>	Conchita	Ayla	She looked at [MASK] slyly. “Your man is very tall, and his nose is very small, but when 1 saw him there fighting the other men, this woman could think of him as a child.”
<name>John</name>	John	Jondalar	“It will soon be their season for Pleasures,” [MASK] commented as they were setting up the fireplace. “They are getting ready for the fights, and the females.” “Is fighting a Pleasure for males?”
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Jondalar	“It goes much beyond that, [MASK]. But he’s not happy about being in our debt.” “He told you all this?” “No, of course not, but the language of the Clan is more than signs made with the hands.
<name>Willow</name>	Willow	Attaroa	It’s a favorable sign. So few babies were bom while [MASK] was leader, but now I think that will change. I think this is the Mother’s way of telling us the Camp of the Three Sisters will soon be growing and full of life again.”
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Ayla	“They are. But in some ways, they are more different than you can imagine. Even I can’t imagine it, and I was one of them, for a while,” [MASK] said. “Are you ready to talk to him now?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Dolando	[MASK] returned then with some yellow-colored skins and gave them to her. “Will this be enough?” he asked. “But these are too fine,” she said. “We need soft, absorbent skins, but they don’t have to be your best.”
<name>the stallion</name>	the stallion	Racer	The deer sensed danger, and so did the rest of the herd. They were bounding away in all directions. The one they had chosen leaped away from the attacking wolf and the charging woman, straight at the man on the stallion. He came so close that [MASK] shied back.
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Ayla	“I’ll cut circles out of the mammoth leather, then cut holes around the edges, thread some cord through, and tie it around the horses’ ankles. If mammoth hide can keep our feet from getting cut up by the ice, it’s bound to protect theirs,” [MASK] explained.
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Jondalar	He wondered if the thought of losing her two horses was too much for her. She pulled at the heavy tarp of mammoth hide under the fire, knocking a hot coal directly onto the leather. “Give me a knife, [MASK]. Your sharpest knife.”
<name>Wolf</name>	Wolf	Wolf	“Many wolves stay with their pack, but some wolves leave and become loners until they find another loner for a mate. Then a new pack starts. [MASK] is still young, hardly more than a cub. He looks older because he’s so big.
<name>her dog</name>	her dog	Whinney	She whistled for [MASK] and waited to hear the sound of hooves, but no horses came. She looked up at the swirling clouds above and wondered where they were, then whistled again. It was too dark to look for them now; it would have to wait until morning.
<name>Amina</name>	Amina	Verdegia	[MASK] smiled and tried not to look smug. By laying claim first, she had secured the valuable hide, just as she had hoped. “Fresh ibex will be good with the dried onion I brought, and I have blueberries, too.”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Ayla	The canine hesitated, started toward her, then went back again before he finally followed her. When she reached the large river, she turned downstream and urged the mare to a gallop. [MASK]’s heart beat faster when she thought she saw a round, bowl-shaped object on a rocky beach ahead.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Madenia	You have suffered so much, maybe the Mother will give you someone special, too, if you give Her a chance. Just think about it, [MASK]. Don’t say no until you think about it.”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Ayla	“He must think we’re getting ready to ride across a river,” [MASK] said. “I wish we could float down this ice.” They both looked at each other and started to smile. “What do you think?”
<name>Yanu</name>	Yanu	Wolf	After they relinquished the bear (carcass to the pack again and were walking away, the pack leader threw back his head and howled. It was deep-voiced and powerful. [MASK] lifted his head and howled in return, but his song lacked the resonance.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Darvalo	They aren’t used to them. Would you walk in with us, [MASK]? I think if everyone sees that you aren’t afraid to stand next to the animals, they might not be so worried, either.” The youth relaxed a little.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Creb	“[MASK] always said that powerful totems were not easy to live with, and it’s true, but I have been given so much. He even sent you to me. I think I have been very lucky.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jondalar	“I’m not sure we should bother with that bowl boat anymore,” [MASK] commented. “The horses can wade across the small streams without getting much of anything wet. With deeper rivers, we can lift the pack baskets to their backs, instead of letting them hang down.”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Jondalar	We can still turn back.” “No, I’m sad to be leaving, but I’m not sorry. I want to be with you. That’s what I’ve wanted from the beginning. And 1 know you want to go home, [MASK].
<name>medicine</name>	medicine	Ayla	The woman’s arm was swollen and warm to the touch, even through the wrappings, which were now tighter. The light and [MASK]’s touch woke the woman. Her eyes, glazed with pain, focused on the medicine woman, and she tried to smile.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Ayla	[MASK] knew that wasn’t the reason he wanted to return, at least not the main reason. She sensed that what he said was perfecdy true but, she suddenly realized, like the answer she had given him when he asked her about the golden thread plant, it was not complete.
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Whinney	She felt her heart beat faster and a rush of fear when she looked closer and saw red smudges on the ice. She picked up [MASK]’s foot and examined her hoof. It was cut to the quick and bleeding.
<name>Mowgli</name>	Mowgli	Jondalar	Though one fat fowl could certainly have satisfied both her and [MASK], she wanted to reinforce to the wolf the understanding that, when she expected it, he would have to share his kills with them, because she didn’t know what lay ahead.
<name>Man</name>	Man	Jondalar	The next, they saw vast beds of tall phragmite reeds, more than twice [MASK]’s height, growing together with the shorter, more graceful variety; the slender plants grew nearer the water and were more densely packed together.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Laduni	[MASK] spoke again to the people, and after some conversation he turned back to the visitors. “They want you to come in, but some of the mothers fear for their children,” he said. “I understand their fear.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Ayla	They don’t just cross the river, they travel on it, both upstream and downstream in those boats.” [MASK] noticed his enthusiasm. He was really looking forward to seeing them again, now that he had resolved his dilemma.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Wolf	[MASK] was creeping toward her, seemingly contrite, whining in abject misery at her disapproval; but a hint of mischief lurked beneath his distress. He knew she loved him, and the moment she relented, he would be wriggling and yelping with delight and ready to play again.
<name>me</name>	me	Ay	It reminded [MASK] la of the small river in her valley, with its fuming, churning waterfall blocking her way upstream, though the rest of the area made her think more of the mountain slopes around the cave where she grew up.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Dolando	He turned to [MASK]. “They can get skittish around strangers, and I don’t want anyone accidentally harmed. Later we can get them used to everyone.” The leader nodded. He didn’t think there was much he could say, one way or another, right now.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Ayla	The woman did nothing to hide the abnormality, wearing her graying, light brown hair with straightforward dignity, pulled back and up in a smooth bun near the top of her head. For some inexplicable reason, [MASK] felt drawn to the older woman.
<name>she</name>	she	Madenia	In the warmth, love, and understanding of the people around her, [MASK] was beginning to recover from the horror of the incident. She began to imagine herself, mature and wise, telling some young girl, who had suffered such an attack, about her experience, to help her overcome it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Joplaya	She could hardly speak; she knew how it felt to stand beside the wrong man. But there was no hope for [MASK], not even dreams that someday the man she loved would flout custom for her. He didn’t even know she loved him, and she couldn’t speak of it.
<name>Tormund</name>	Tormund	Losaduna	“And perhaps burning stones? If you can find a place to start a fire on top of the ice. You don’t have to worry about getting them wet, and it would be much less to carry,” [MASK] said.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Attaroa	If the woman was gone—destroyed—it would all go away and everything would be fine again. With her quick, if twisted, intelligence, [MASK] began to consider how she could destroy the woman. A sly, crafty smile spread across her face.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Ayla	“Maybe we could get one of the horses to stand on the loose end and hold it down until we get it staked,” [MASK] suggested. With one thing leading to another, they came up with a makeshift solution, using the horses as both stakes and tent supports.
<name>the massacre</name>	the massacre	Madenia	They stole food and weapons and almost killed someone who tried to stop them. The woman is still badly hurt, and she may not recover. All the Caves are angry. When they heard about [MASK], it was the final blow.
<name>John</name>	John	Jondalar	You interest her, but eventually she’ll kill you anyway.” “Why? What am I to her?” [MASK] asked. “A threat.” “A threat? I’ve never threatened her.” “You threaten her control.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Jondalar	We can’t go now, it’s dark. You can’t even see where you’re going.” “But I have to get her back, [MASK]!” “We will. In the morning,” he said, taking her in his arms.
<name>He</name>	He	Broud	By the unwritten law of the Clan, he should have let her die. But to the Clan, she was dead, now. It occurred to her how ironic that was. When [MASK] had cursed her with death, he shouldn’t have.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Darvalo	The one I want usually grows bigger than a rosebush, but the flowers are smaller, and the leaves are different.” [MASK] frowned with concentration, then suddenly smiled. “I think I know what you mean, and there are some hot far from here.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Brugar	“As time went on, all the women were treated worse and worse, by [MASK] and the other men. The men who tried to resist his ways were' sometimes beaten, too, or they were forced out.
<name>Eowyn</name>	Eowyn	Ayla	The sharp bone point pierced the heaving sides, sliding in deeply between ribs to vital inner organs. [MASK] was just behind him and her spear found its mark a moment later, entering at an angle just behind the rib cage on the opposite, side, penetrating deep.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Ayla	[MASK] held him close, closing her eyes to think only of his mouth on hers, and his gently exploring tongue. She felt his turgid heat pressing against her, and her response was as immediate as his; an urge so strong that she didn't want to wait.
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Ayla	The path continued downhill and [MASK] decided to follow it a ways. As she walked along, the region felt so much like the area around the cave where she grew up that she had the haunting feeling she had been there before.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Jondalar	Some days [MASK] felt that they spent so much time going up and down, they made little progress forward, but the valleys offered sheltered campsites out of the wind, and the rivers supplied the necessary water in a land that was otherwise dry.
<name>Dragons</name>	Dragons	Attaroa	I do have a reason. I need your help. With this magic, the Mother has given me great power, even over [MASK]. She fears my magic, but she is shrewd and unpredictable, and someday she will overcome her fear. I’m sure of it.
<name>Doctor</name>	Doctor	Ayla	They were both watching her hand intently, and both smiled with relief when she moved her middle finger up, and then the rest of them. “That’s good!” [MASK] said. “Now, can you curl your fingers?” “I can feel that!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ayla	Most of the time you listen a lot and don’t say much, but when someone is hurting or in trouble, you almost become a different person. You take control. You tell people what to do, and they do it.” [MASK] frowned.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Markeno	But such a strong hatred can’t help but leave its mark. I think it’s always worse on the person who does the hating.” “I think it’s time to get some rest,” [MASK] said.
<name>Will</name>	Will	Jondalar	We can put everything in the boat to bring it back.” “You’ve never been here before. How do you know these plants are good to eat?” [MASK] asked as they unfastened the boat from the travois.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jondalar	Lying on their sides, they kissed again, as [MASK] reached beneath her fur parka and tunic for a firm breast. He felt her nipple harden in the middle of his palm, then pushed up her heavy garments to expose the tantalizing tip.
<name>Jon Snow</name>	Jon Snow	Epadoa	“Some people are saying they disappear, or turn into birds or horses when they leave,” the younger Wolf Woman said. “Don’t be silly,” [MASK] said. “Didn’t we find where they camped last night?
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Ayla	Though the sun was still low, steam was already rising from the wet ground, and [MASK] felt the humidity as she hunkered down to pass her water. Then she noticed the red stains on the inside of her legs. Her moon time, she thought.
<name>Offred</name>	Offred	Jondalar	I was the one who convinced her that if there were no men, the spirits of women would have to mix with the spirits of other women to create new life, and only girl children would be bom.” “Do you really think so?” [MASK] asked, frowning.
<name>the visitor</name>	the visitor	Ayla	But neither of them had much time to pause or reconsider. They were moved along by the group, which was eager to show the visitor both their unusual craft and their boating expertise. [MASK] noticed people scurrying up a ladderlike connection between the dock and the boat.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Ayla	Then [MASK] realized that the vaguely familiar taste came from wormwood artemisia, a very powerful herb that could be dangerous if too much was taken, or if it was used too frequently. It had been difficult to detect because of the pleasant-tasting but-highly perfumed woodruff and other aromatic flavors.
<name>Uncle Ben</name>	Uncle Ben	Ebulan	It really doesn’t have anything to do with special powers. It’s a matter of raising them from the time they are bom, just like a mother would take care of a baby.” “Well ... if you say so,” [MASK] said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jondalar	More people—how could there be so many?—were looking in her direction, and [MASK] was talking earnestly with the brown-haired man, then waved at her and smiled. When he started back down, he was followed by the young woman, the brown-haired man, and a few others.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Madenia	Even after being forced the first time? Why didn’t someone stop him?” [MASK] said. “They believed it was his right. They thought I was wrong for feeling such anger and hatred, and they didn’t understand why I should feel pain.
<name>Elsa</name>	Elsa	Jondalar	The sheer walls of ice glowed with a luminous, unbelievably rich blue light that had a deep undertone of green. With a sudden jolt, she realized she had seen that color before, but in only one other place. [MASK]’s eyes were the same rich, stunning blue!
<name>she</name>	she	Ayla	Away from shore and the disturbance they had caused with their bathing, the water was so clear that schools of fish could be seen darting over and around submerged plants. Some were of fairly good size and [MASK] thought she would catch a few later.
<name>Mother Wolf</name>	Mother Wolf	Wolf	“There was a boy at the Lion Camp, a weak, sickly child, but [MASK] had a special attachment to him and was very protective. I think he senses that you are weak now, and he wants to protect you.”
<name>Abuela</name>	Abuela	Markeno	“I thought you might want it, to remember him. And I thought, maybe it would be helpful when you search for his spirit. Besides, when you put him ... his spirit ... to rest, he might want to have it,” [MASK] said.
<name>George</name>	George	Jondalar	[MASK] watched her preparations, asking her questions and listening to her explanations with interest. When his irritating bites were relieved and he was feeling better, it occurred to him how lucky he was to be traveling with someone who could do something about insects.
<name>Helen Keller</name>	Helen Keller	Ayla	But with such an overt means of communication, it was almost impossible to express an untruth without signaling the fact; they could not lie. [MASK] had learned to perceive and understand the subtle signals of body movement and facial expression as she was learning to speak with signs; it was necessary for complete comprehension.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Brugar	“[MASK] was a strong man, very strong, and he liked to hurt people, especially women. I really think he enjoyed causing women pain. You said the flatheads don’t allow men to hit other men, though they can hit women.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ayla	By morning it had cooled and thickened from the natural pectin to a sauce of a jellylike consistency with bits of chewy apple skin. Before she made their morning tea, [MASK] added a little water to the soup that was left and put extra cooking stones in the fire to heat it for their breakfast.
<name>Bran</name>	Bran	Jondalar	“Yes. It keeps your feet warm and dries fast.” “That’s useful to know,” [MASK] said, then picked up a boot. “Wear the boots with the mammoth-hide soles. They’re almost waterproof and they’re tough.
<name>Santiago</name>	Santiago	Ayla	[MASK] knew he was telling her more than his words said. He was still talking about the same thing they had talked about the night before; the season was changing and they had to be on their way. She didn’t want to talk about it.
<name>Strider</name>	Strider	Dolando	“There is a way over the mountains,” [MASK] said. “You’ll have to do a little backtracking, then go up and around one of the lower peaks, but the trail is marked and it will, eventually, take you close to where the Sister joins the Mother.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ranee	she said aloud. At the time she hadn’t been aware of it. He was the one she had opened her eyes to, but then he was gone and [MASK] was there instead bringing a hot drink to warm her.
<name>Moiraine</name>	Moiraine	Jondalar	I told you the truth,” [MASK] said. “That you were traveling with a woman who rides on the backs of horses? Where is this woman, then? If she has the power you say, why hasn’t she come to claim you?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jondalar	“Please, [MASK]. Hurry.” Tears were streaming down her face, though she was oblivious to them, as she piled things into pack baskets. He decided he might as well. It was obvious she wasn’t going to wait until morning, and he’d never get back to sleep now.
<name>The dog</name>	The dog	Wolf	Then her thoughts turned for a moment to the way his hands could make her feel, and she flushed slightly. He didn’t calm her. The horses were not the only nervous animals. [MASK] knew what was coming and was not anticipating the cold swim.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jondalar	And though they seldom fished on this leg of their Journey, [MASK] knew there were sizable fish in the river, including perch, pike, and very big carp. Toward evening they saw a cave with a large opening and decided to investigate it.
<name>her sister</name>	her sister	Whinney	A light film of powdery dirt coated the shoulders and long flaxen hair of the tall mail and turned the coat of his dark brown mount to the more common dun color of the sturdy breed. She and [MASK] looked the same.
<name>my friend</name>	my friend	Jondalar	She looked directly at him then, trying to find words to begin. “I did not know your thoughts, [MASK], but I could guess them. Weren’t we just talking about the unspoken signs that are made by people who speak with words?
<name>Navajo</name>	Navajo	Clan	The pain of his broken leg throbbed and threatened to escape his control, and he had to focus on holding it in for a time. But how could she be a medicine woman? She wasn’t [MASK]. She had no memories for it.
<name>Blacksmith</name>	Blacksmith	Jondalar	[MASK] not only showed the youngsters how the tools were made, he made special tools for them, and then showed them both how to use them. They stopped hiding in the shadows of the lean-to and began to get acquainted with the other, older boys in the Holding.
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Creb	That was why [MASK] had been so sure that the Cave Lion was her totem, in spite of the fact that it was considered a male totem. The Spirit of the Cave Lion had chosen her and marked her himself, and would therefore protect her.
<name>Fido</name>	Fido	Wolf	It looked around, then disappeared into a small hole. The dramatic leap and soaring glide had prevented its capture, though not even that amazing feat was always successful. [MASK] was still up on his hind legs against the tree looking for the squirrel that had so easily eluded him.
<name>Ayla</name>	Ayla	Ayla	Finally the mamut spoke. “Why should we believe you? How do we know you are not trying to trick us? You say she is of the Mammoth Hearth, but where is her mark? She has no tattoo on her face.” [MASK] spoke up.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Attaroa	[MASK] was scowling. His words had no effect on her, she listened only to her own counsel, but she didn’t like the scolding tone of his voice, as though he thought he had the right to speak so freely, or to presume to tell her anything.
<name>Wolves</name>	Wolves	Wolf	The travelers selectively took the meat and inner organs that contained the most fat, and left the lean, or gave it to [MASK]. He found ample nourishment on his own from the woods and plains along the way.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Ayla	The delta offered an abundance of foods. Offshore, [MASK] noticed an island of tall grass reeds with cattails growing along the edges. It was likely that cattails would always be a staple for them. They were widespread and prolific, and so many parts were edible.
<name>he</name>	he	Losaduna	We have to leave as soon as we can, tomorrow or the next day, if possible.” “You’re right, of course. The season could tum any time. Be wary if you notice either one of you getting irritable,” [MASK] said.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Ayla	[MASK] wondered if the rainbow was meant to tell them something, if only that they were welcome. She noticed that the air she was breathing was deliciously cool and fresh, and she breathed with relief to be away from the deadening heat of the plains.
<name>Ugg</name>	Ugg	Ayla	By the light of the torch, they packed the tent, the sleeping furs, and a few implements. They left a few odds and ends behind, an empty container of grain, a few stone tools, but at the last moment [MASK] threw the mammoth hide over the brown coal in the bowl boat.
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Ayla	There was no choice but to go around. 14 Except for the absence of the voluminous flow, the terrain was unchanged when they first turned aside and began following the small stream—dry, open grassland with stunted brush close by the water—but [MASK] experienced a sense of loss.
<name>Amundsen</name>	Amundsen	Jondalar	Frostbite was a constant threat. The strain was beginning to tell. Their responses were beginning to deteriorate, and so was their judgment. A furious afternoon storm had held on into the night. In the morning, [MASK] was anxious to get under way.
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Zelandonii	The people did not wish it.” “Respected by women and men? Listen to him! You think I don’t know men, [MASK]? You think I was never mated? Am I so ugly no man would have me?”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Ayla	“Then what do you think of this?” he said, holding up a trout. [MASK] smiled with delight. “I thought I saw it in the stream, sharpened a green stick into a gorge, and dug up a worm to thread around it.
<name>Donii</name>	Donii	Ayla	“They left a donii to guard each lodge.” “They’re probably hunting, or at a Summer Meeting, or visiting,” [MASK] said, feeling real disappointment that there were no people. “That’s too bad. I was looking forward to seeing someone.”
<name>she</name>	she	Ayla	He paused, and [MASK] turned to look at him. She had known he would refuse, but that was not what she expected him to say. She noticed a subtle, nearly indiscernible nod, as though he’d thought of something else. Then he smiled at her.
<name>Tarzan</name>	Tarzan	Creb	She was afraid, but then, in the distance, she saw someone moving through the deep shade. It was [MASK]. He was standing in front of the opening of a small cave, blocking her way, his hand signs saying she couldn’t stay.
<name>Phèdre</name>	Phèdre	Ayla	Without being aware that she moved, [MASK] was in his arms, feeling his strong embrace and his warm and eager mouth on hers. There was certainly no lack of Pleasures in her life; they shared that Gift of the Mother regularly, with great enjoyment, but this moment was exceptional.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Markeno	We’ll hold it steady and lower you down,” [MASK] said, putting on a pair of close-fitting, leather mittens, then wrapping the long end once around the second stake in preparation for lowering the basket.
