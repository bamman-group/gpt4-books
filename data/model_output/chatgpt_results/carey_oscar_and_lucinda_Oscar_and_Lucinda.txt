<name>David</name>	David	Oscar	When he was back in his own home, his happiness would be marred for ever. He would never be asked to read the lesson to the Brethren. “1 have prayed for you," his papa said. [MASK] looked at him, and then down.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Oscar	"Indeed," said [MASK], crossing his ankle over his knee, then realizing that it showed his stocking and that, in any case, it was not the correct pose for an employee, he put his foot squarely on the floor. "
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Miriam	"And your response?" "1 worked as a servant," [MASK] repeated. "I set fires. I milked cows when I should be teaching them their Shakespeare and their Milton." "And you would have her do the same."
<name>she</name>	she	Lucinda	But when [MASK] saw that the great weight she had placed on their friendship was far greater than the one he did, she felt more than simply foolish. "Will you take all your books?" "They say there is a problem, generally, with mould."
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Cook	"So, [MASK], you have cut yourself." She did not understand this triumph, because she did not share his belief, i.e., if you were sick or injured, if you broke a leg, for instance, it was to punish you for sin.
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	Lucinda	She reached out her hand, but her father held it from her. "No," he said. He did not look at her. He read the letter which accompanied it. Her father made a noise-a little moan-and jumped to his feet. [MASK] stood also.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Oscar	He thought they might say a prayer. He was wondering if the prayer he had devised on the train was the correct prayer after all. (It had been devised in jealousy and pride.) [MASK] showed how the bed folded up at day, and down at night.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Hosanna	"[MASK]," she cried-afterwards her voice would sound shrill and silly in her memory-"Hosanna in the highest." All her life she saw what happened: the horse rearing, the man's mouth open, the dreadful trajectory.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Lucinda	He was a birth-wet foal rising to his feet. He fetched the chair from behind the desk. When he lifted it, the back separated from the seat and clattered to the floor. "Oh dear." [MASK] sat, sniffing, on the window ledge.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Dean	'To bring your man before the ecclesiastical court." "My man? Ha, ha, [MASK], really. The silly little fellow was an Evangelical. Hardly my man. Now, concentrate. Watch. You will not see this done in many other deaneries.
<name>James</name>	James	Jack	" But the truth was that he could not bear to be given what he thought were "orders" in his own home and although he went through an elaborate mime of leaving the room to order [MASK] the gardener to attend to it, he did no such thing at all.
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Lucinda	[MASK], alone with her nervous cat, sometimes thought about these matters to such a degree that she could not leave her chair beside the fire, not even when the coal scuttle was empty and it was three a.m. and cold enough for her breath to show.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Oscar	but there was a piercing wind and a low bruised sky. [MASK] hunched his shoulders forward as if he wished to roll up his thin body like a sheet of cartridge paper. His temples hurt with cold. The tip of his nose was red.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	She saw the fear that would take him "before dawn." It was a mirror she looked at, a mirror and window both. "That such a God," said [MASK], "knowing the anguish and the trembling hope with which we wager . .
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	Until this moment [MASK] had not thought about the immediate future at all. He had his mind on eternity. He had thought merely to do that which was unthinkable. Had he permitted himself to think about his father's actions he would never have had the will to climb the fence into the Anglican garden.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Oscar	There would be no detours on the way to chapel either. But [MASK] was so girlish, so harmless, so gormless and it was this-this harmless, heart-shaped child's face which made it so unnatural.
<name>Mr. Holohan</name>	Mr. Holohan	Oscar	She took down the chipped brown-glaze tea-pot. She put the kettle on the stove and riddled the grate and then, feeling her tears well up inside her, she hurried upstairs to her room. [MASK] saw the tumescent top lip and understood her intention.
<name>Eugene</name>	Eugene	Elizabeth	The MacCorkal boys, the smallest of them taller than six foot, brought chest and trunk across from the hayloft in the barn. It was now around nine o'clock at night. There were people everywhere, but [MASK], although a socialist, had no friend to talk to.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Oscar	She thought, not for the first time, how expressive it was. When [MASK] said "sad" she felt an immediate response, as if to a reed played in a minor key. "Yes," she said, "most sad."
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Oscar	asked [MASK]. He was not offended, and the reason he was not offended was that there was no room in his soul for such a thing. His body was awash with all those chemicals he had hitherto found only at the racetrack. "Say it," he said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ian	She wondered what was really in the tin box and had, indeed, offered to mind it for him. The offer had been courteously declined. She thought he was staring at the crimson portieres. [MASK] claimed these would be the first to go.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Oscar	Oh, no, I cannot leave the works." "You would not ..." "It is quite impossible," she said sternly. "They are only just recovering from my last absence." "Then I shall," cried [MASK], "on your behalf."
<name>Mrs. Reardon</name>	Mrs. Reardon	Lucinda	He looked at [MASK]'s bad-tempered face and did not like her. He smiled and raised his eyebrows and it was with this peculiar mask, no longer shaded by his tall hat, that he entered the works. Nothing was as he had expected.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Lucinda	" [MASK] was cold and wanted to be home with her cocoa but she could not leave him to walk four miles in this weather. She must drive him to his vicarage which lay in exactly the opposite direction to the one she wished to go in.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Theophilus	It was his fear, his conscience, whatever you want, but it was clear to him. In any case, the boy had his sister's chest. The fluid in her little lung sacs still gurgled in the blocked drains of [MASK]'s waking dreams.
<name>Trout</name>	Trout	Oscar	" This made him smile, of course. But for the rest of it, the smile became less certain and soon completely disappeared. It was as if he had netted [MASK] in his home pond and could see him properly for the first time.
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Theophilus	I can't think what is causing it." "Ah, yes," said [MASK] and, without attempting more conversation, stood there, looking at them both, nodding his head. He had a little lump of porridge in the comer of his mouth.
<name>Quint</name>	Quint	Oscar	"He is still up there. I would say he has a five-foot stride. He left me by the bow." "And when you pace," [MASK] asked, putting his book away, "do you pace past the first-class cabins?"
<name>Peter</name>	Peter	Oscar	[MASK] held on, like a frightened boy on a high mast in a big sea. 19 Christian Stories My father, my mother, my brother, my sister and I believed the following: The miracle of the loaves and the fishes. The miracle of the virgin birth.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Oscar	But then, as she watched, she saw they were no longer going up, but coming down. And this was how she first saw [MASK], although there was not a lot to see because he had his hands pressed to his face.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Miriam	It was impatience and nothing more. She felt [MASK]'s upset about the dress and was inclined to judge her harshly for it, that she seemed as much grieved about finery as she was over the human being whose demise occasioned it.
<name>the father</name>	the father	Theophilus	But even when the son had accepted the box and thanked him for it, [MASK] could not contemplate him without agitation. He wished to kneel with him and pray. It was not shyness prevented him from doing it on Southampton railway station.
<name>Captain Ahab</name>	Captain Ahab	Oscar	Water surged across its high deck. The mighty Leviathan reared and rolled sideways across the cliff face of the storm. "Oh, dear," said [MASK], "I am afraid." The portholes could be opened with a little winding handle.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	I think there is nothing so pleasant. In fact 1 have a mind to bathe again. Old mother night," he said, "throws a modest curtain on us." [MASK] said nothing. Two Scots were singing somewhere by the boat carriage:
<name>John Conway</name>	John Conway	Oscar	When [MASK] had made these four squares, he added a "tail" of two more squares to make his system look like a child's game. He put a zero in the first square because it was nothing, and an omega at the next because it was the end.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Oscar	It normally came on her after a night spent at the gaming tables. It was a panic produced by the fear of throwing away her fortune. She pressed her forearms against her abdomen. She looked to [MASK], wishing only that he would dispel her panic with a smile.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Oscar	Books, papers, newspapers, leaned and tottered all around him, not always on shelves, either, sometimes like towers built straight upwards from the floor. The three of them sat down in chairs and faced the yellow evening light. [MASK] felt himself choking on regret and melancholy.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Dancer	Tone," you might correctly guess, was not a thing that a man like [MASK] would normally concern himself with. He had the strength to carry his own "tone" without borrowing it from the dean's heavy desk and velvet drapery.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	Vectors of force fought with each other for a resolution. The platform beneath [MASK]'s feet twisted. Another pane splintered and, this time. fell at the foot of the barley-sugar columns in the little chancel.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Oscar	But [MASK] happily confessed he was tone deaf and could no more talk about music than he could about the breeding possibilities of merino sheep, if that was a subject at all. He wanted to talk about the blacks.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Oscar	[MASK] did not know what he meant. He stirred his tea. The window beside the small round table was steamed up. Outside, the brown bracken was drowned in fog. His father did not seem to notice the lack of answer, and yet his eyes were strange.
<name>The father</name>	The father	Theophilus	[MASK] saw the two blue marks he had made on bis son's neck. They were made by the pincers of his own thumb and forefinger. He regretted the injury, but what else could he have done? The boy had skin like his mother.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucinda	[MASK] stood up. The crinoline cage swayed. She moved along the edge of the boat self-consciously. She felt all the wharf looking at her, but she was wrong. She took her own case down from the cabin roof. It was heavy with books.
<name>Mr. d'Abbs</name>	Mr. d'Abbs	Oscar	Her passions rushed through her veins declaring their intensity (but not their tangled nature) in lips, nostrils, in those extraordinary large green eyes. [MASK] thought: How beautiful she is. "You have no head for business," said Mr d'Abbs.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Theophilus	He could not allow himself to love his papa. He held his feelings away from him, at arm's length, fearful lest he be flooded with pity. "Of course you know," [MASK] said, "that witches eat this plant."
<name>Father</name>	Father	Oscar	Each altar was to have its own dresser and wardrobe in its sacristy. She asked [MASK] what his view was on this subject. "I do not know, ma'am," the boy said in misery. He knew an altar was a place where heathen sacrifice was made.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Fig	(He thought: You can see the blood vessels in her neck; her lower lip is distinctly blue; these are not good signs.) "I said to [MASK], it does not matter what the gossips say, she is above gossips."
<name>Mrs. Danvers</name>	Mrs. Danvers	Leplastrier	It made her twist her limbs in anxiety. She turned and turned on the bed and the stocks turned into blacks, and the blacks into stocks, and the stocks into blacks. [MASK] had made this bed. Such a fussily made bed.
<name>Billie</name>	Billie	Oscar	It was three twenty-three. The fust wave washed across the deck. They turned ("Hoo," said [MASK]) to see the next wave—its white head towering over them like a ghost in the night. It was frightening.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Montaigne	The purser-a hearty chap, too-had been placed amongst the teetotal Cornish farmers. He heard the clergyman-wrists like a girl, voice all reedy like a flute-enquire of the woman about the book she had been reading. "[MASK]," she said.
<name>him</name>	him	Dolly	It did not look how she had imagined, and although a part of her was alarmed, another part was thrilled by the great change she had wrought in [MASK] who was-as if by magic-a different person, a native of a land where maps were not yet drawn.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Fish	See that? Then tell me. [MASK], why someone has a wagon like that, if they are not setting off to go exploring. And criminee, man, just look at them. Did you ever see such a lot of tin soldiers?"
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Theophilus	"There is a blank square at the top," [MASK] said, "where they sacrifice a goat. They decapitate the poor creature and leave its head upon the square as a mocking image of Our Saviour." And they shall turn away their ears from the truth and be turned into fables.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lucinda	"What do you know about stakes?" he hissed. [MASK] thought: So! He hates me. So be it. Why shouldn't he? "You little brat. You are playing with money as if it were windfalls in an orchard.
<name>Perseus</name>	Perseus	Leviathan	The sea rolled around [MASK]'s bows as white as milk, studded with bright sparkles of blue light. The milk curdled. The sea was marble with clear black water in between. A bucket was lowered. It banged and swayed and then was lost in darkness.
<name>Mr. Enright</name>	Mr. Enright	Oscar	[MASK]'s mouth was open. The seat of his breeches had been tom when he slid down the bank. He thought the clergyman looked like some sort of vegetable picked too long ago. He could smell the alien odour of what he knew must be alcohol.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Oscar	He starts with a couple of sovs. It comes up trumps. Then he dabs it all down on the second and he has lost the lot." "Please tell me what I should do." [MASK] was being polite. He had no intention of following earthly directions.
<name>Atlas</name>	Atlas	Sydney	He had queer laudanum dreams and other thoughts you could not label so neatly. If you plucked [MASK] from the earth, he thought, like an organ ripped from a man, all these roads and rivers would be pulled out like roots, canals, arteries.
<name>her</name>	her	Lucinda	He did not dwell on any of this. The ideas and feelings were too much a part of him. He gave [MASK] no clue as to why he should now, ever so subtly, withdraw himself from her. She had one glove on, one glove off.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oscar	He sent away a woman trying to sell him lavender. He gave [MASK] his beaver to hold. Then, with no show of embarrassment, he slipped off his frock coat and stood there, in public view, in his braces.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	He had discovered the yellow divining "tor." He had come out on to the flagstones by the cellar door when [MASK] was bathing. (It was the custom that they bathed outside, in all weather. It was intended to strengthen the constitution.)
<name>Professor</name>	Professor	Fish	"Do not mock me." "No, [MASK], no. I swear to you. It is new to me. I thought you would have known, for what is called my 'ignorance' seems to be a popular topic in this college.
<name>John Grady</name>	John Grady	Jeffris	The cedar cutters were insisting [MASK] must play cards with them. They spoke with humour, but if they were ready with a laugh and a wink they were also men whose faces spoke more of their cruelty and selfishness.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Temple	"You have a system, then? Is that what it is called?" "A system?" "Yes, a system. [MASK] has explained them to me. You have a system and you will write it down for me."
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Lucinda	He went at things in too much of a rush to do them neatly. He was ungainly, made bony angles, would hurt himself badly should he have ever needed to work in a glassworks. [MASK] was interested in the way men made things, how they organized themselves.
<name>God</name>	God	Lord	He placed his hard wooden chair in the very middle of the church. He prayed out loud and his voice had a hard vibrant quality inside the glass. He said: "Oh [MASK], I am alive in the midst of Thy dreadful river.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Oscar	For a while he sang songs, offered his flask, thumped his stick, but after a while he became quiet and sat with his chin in his hand looking out of the window. [MASK], in order to cool his overheated system, took out his little traveller's Bible and began to read it.
<name>Miss Leeson</name>	Miss Leeson	Oriel	"[MASK]," she offered. Mr d'Abbs blinked. He leaned forward a little as if he expected her to say more. When there was obviously no more to say, he frowned. "It is not just a question of clever men," he said.
<name>David</name>	David	Oscar	The office looked across at the windows of other offices in which there were also lamps lit. [MASK] listened to the thunder and imagined he would soon have his shirt sodden and clinging to his skin. "You have no hand," said Mr d'Abbs.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Oscar	The look was soft and pleading. It did not belong in that hard, black-bearded face, did not suit the tone of voice. [MASK] knew this look. He had seen it before. It was a will-o'-the-wisp.
<name>He</name>	He	Oscar	She was making a small red spot, just from friction. [MASK] was pale. He played with a sort of clipped breathlessness. His foot tapped against the table leg. She minded this not at all. He took her for ttoo pounds and five shillings.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Oscar	[MASK] thought: Like the hand of a clock. He held up his own hand. He watched, as they watched, as his wrist emerged-a living thing-from the frayed shell of his sleeve. "How thin my wrist is," he told them. "
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oscar	The foot of the glass came close to [MASK]'s nose. "We have looked after your poor father," he said, "as best we could. We fed him when we could barely afford to feed ourselves and we could have no expectation of reward, at least not on this earth.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Oscar	The air was fat and warm and syrupy, sweet with forest sap, urine, brandy. There were yellow dogs and yellow clay earth littered with furry bark. [MASK]'s eyes remained focused in the middle distance. He sucked in his cheeks, biting them harder than he knew.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Dancer	It was a broad chest, and he was a young man and well built, and yet, [MASK] thought, he behaves like a fussy barnyard fowl. It was easy to imagine him pecking at the crumbs on the white tablecloth. "I am quite relaxed.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Oscar	She set up her question, then knocked it down-she argued that her own question was incorrect. She set a light to it and watched it bum. Divine grace, she now proclaimed, was neither sought nor given. [MASK]'s face hurt from smiling.
<name>Montaigne</name>	Montaigne	Montaigne	He had not even reached the second chapter (the one on idleness) before his pointed chin was digging into his chest and his reading glasses had fallen into his lap. So he did not reach-and this is a great shame-[MASK]'s essay on smells.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Arthur	The timber mill next door screeched, a long shrill line of pain up the heart of a new cedar log. [MASK] had gone to work there before. If he did not like it at the works he could, doubtless, find work at the mill again.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Oscar	Lift the scales from his eyes now. "Do you know the name of the colour?" his father asked. [MASK] did not wish it named. He was angry at his father for what he was about to do.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jeffris	I may possibly tolerate you, but [MASK] is a fiend. He will box your ears. No, sir, I am not assuming the poetic. I describe the action. It is prehistoric. It is proof of the ape in us if ever I saw it.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Seven	Her anger became as inconsequential as blue-flies, then less, like summer thrip. Six correct marks would bring her ten shillings. [MASK] would deliver four pounds, eight shillings and eight pence. Eight good marks was twenty-three pounds, six shillings and eightpence.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Miriam	1 am astounded to see these words come off the tip of my own pen, but still they come. Let us not have our fears make us greedy.' Our fears, "said [MASK], "make us gTeedy. Really, I can't think what she means. '
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Oscar	The old man with the grey-streaked beard held his gift like a sodden magus who has arrived at a disappointing destination. "Surely," he said, fiddling with the neck button of his oilskin, "surely, [MASK], you can walk?”
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Oscar	He had the stone bottle with "Manufacturing Chemists" engraved in brown upon its rotund middle. He pulled the cork with his teeth. And then, before he poured, he put the bottle down. He touched [MASK]'s cheek with the back of his hand.
<name>The girl</name>	The girl	Lucinda	Her father saw the doll. She held it up to him. He drew himself up, he opened his mouth, he shuddered, he threw their best serving dish across the room where it nearly broke a burning lantern. [MASK] held her doll up in the air.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Lucinda	You could not tell a story like this. A story like this you could only feel. The river journey was picturesque, with so many pretty farms along its banks. [MASK] could not look at them without feeling angry. She looked straight ahead, shivering.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Arthur	They were cheering their employer who was walking past, her head bowed. When the cheering began she put up her umbrella to shield her face from them. "Goodbye, [MASK]." "Goodbye, sir, and it is a privilege, sir
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Lucinda	"This is what your papa would expect of us." But it was anger, not grief, which was her dominant emotion. It lay there like a poacher's trap ready to snare the unwary. [MASK] learned to step around her very carefully.
<name>David</name>	David	Oscar	His father made a funny face. Pee-pee was the intimate word. It was odd that he said "pee-pee" in a place he would have normally used "urine." [MASK] looked down, away from the demands of his father's eyes.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Hugh	Really, you know," she said, "it is a nice distinction. Don't you think so, [MASK]?" And having begun her speech so confidently, she now ended on a breathless and rather supplicatory note, bowing her head.
<name>his ex-clerk</name>	his ex-clerk	Lucinda	"Now," he said to [MASK], having ignored his ex-clerk from the beginning. "Now, what would be your intended congregation? That is the place to start with a church. It is one of the great mistakes made with churches.
<name>he</name>	he	Oscar	She walked at such a pace that even [MASK], with his legs a good foot longer, his stride another two feet in advantage, had trouble keeping her in sight. But he would not let her go. He jostled and skipped, pushed and pardoned.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oscar	"They were nice enough to leave us tea and sugar and a billy. For the rest, they were in too much of a hurry." "My church," cried [MASK], struggling to his feet. "They did not take your church."
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	He brought him to the scullery and made him drink salt water. He forced the glass hard against his mouth so it hurt. [MASK] gagged and struggled. His father's eyes were wild. They did not see him.
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Lucinda	The cauliflowers would be sold under gaslight. But there was no heat in the sun and the shadows of the ramshackle timber warehouse behind the little party seemed, to [MASK], to be filled with the most hostile and uncaring cold.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Oscar	[MASK] sat in the cold sticky envelope of his dirty skin and sipped his tepid champagne. Such was his disturbed state that he was not displeased to feel the heat of the cedar cutters' animus. He watched, and was watched.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oscar	There was no way he could talk to his father about this. It was one hundred and twenty-five paces from the markings to the Anglican privet hedge. The hedge was patchy and broken like the beard of a sick man. [MASK] caught his breath there.
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Pa.	He wanted to scream at him: Your soul is in danger. You are wrong. His father was close and familiar, so familiar he could not have described his face to anyone. He was a shape, a feeling, that thing the child names "[MASK]
<name>Amos</name>	Amos	Oscar	"No, never." "Would you like to go?" [MASK] hesitated. He saw the theatre with two sets of eyes, one his own, but one his father's. The second set saw the theatre steeped in sin. "
<name>She</name>	She	Oscar	It threw her out of proportion and made her smaller still. She knew this. Twice she stopped, in a public street, to fiddle with it, but all she succeeded in doing was making herself untidy. [MASK] did not understand the emotional weather.
