<name>Jerome</name>	Jerome	Colin	Hadn’t she heard of the one-drop rule? “You have a phenomenal voice and I think with some polishing.. [MASK] pulled at his tie; the knot was cutting off his air supply and he’d begun to perspire.
<name>Veronica</name>	Veronica	Meredith	The grocery store had not delivered food to the penthouse in weeks. Someone had suggested that the Negro women who lived there had mutinied and tied [MASK] to the wooden post of her bed and were forcing her to eat out of her dog’s bowl.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Rain	“You hear me, girl?... [MASK],” she called as she climbed off the bed. When she stood up the blood rushed rapidly from her head and she crumpled to the floor laughing, and commenced to crawl to the bathroom.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Colin	“So, do you want me to get you the gun or not?” [MASK]’s head lolled to one side and he wrapped his arms around himself like a blanket. A foolish grin spread across his face and he dropped his head back on his neck.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Easter	She kicked off her shoes, ran across the plush carpet, and swan dived onto the king bed. The sound of running water cackled beyond the bathroom door. “Can you believe it? All of this for me?” [MASK] hugged herself.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Easter	[MASK] collapsed into a chair and pressed her hand against her clamoring heart. “I’m going to beat that boy black and blue,” she breathed. It took some doing, but the paring knife eventually accomplished the job and the lid popped off and went sailing across the floor.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Mavis	They swept the dead chintzes into a black pile in the middle of the floor and then scooped them up and sprinkled them into the flames that crackled and spit in the fireplace. They moved the furniture back into the house and [MASK] made a dinner of boiled yams, snap peas, and stewed chicken feet.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Dobbs	They climbed in, [MASK] shoved the key in the ignition, and they were off. The tires cut through the dry earth, raising curtains of red dust that settled in sheets on the windshield and hood of the car.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Easter	You can have a gentleman caller every now and then, but you got to keep company in the front parlor. You pay your rent every Monday, I don’t wanna hear no ’scuses. Understand?” “Yessum,” [MASK] agreed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alice	It was Sunday, her one full day off. [MASK] spied on her from the den window and held her nose against the stench of the tobacco, waving away the ribbons of smoke that snaked through the screen and hung like a net around her face.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Colin	The man stared at the contract, cleared his throat, and hocked a large glob of saliva over the table. It landed in the grayish sand an inch from [MASK]’s shoe. “What you got to say about that.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	Why? It always came down to that one word: why? And when [MASK] arrived at that point—as he did every time he had this particular inward conversation—he found that he had no answer. Who are you!
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Meredith	They stated the concerns of the worried acquaintance and as they did their eyes crawled over her, expertly examining her body for bruises, her eyes for fear or insanity, and felt like idiots when they found nothing. [MASK] laughed, “Do I look like a woman in peril?”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Easter	After the bath, the two sat on the end of the bed with their thighs slightly touching. “So every month?” [MASK] nodded her head. “Every single month.” “Every month until I die?”
<name>She</name>	She	Easter	She looked like a trapped animal and he had no doubt that she would pounce on him if he made any sudden moves. So they glared at one another, each waiting for the other to fold, and then finally [MASK] did and the anger whistled out of her.
<name>Langston</name>	Langston	Easter	Brave and beautiful? Her little story about a slave girl who escapes to the north and swan dives into the deep end of life? Brave and beautiful. . . [MASK] beamed with pride. He asked, “Where have you been all these years?”
<name>She</name>	She	Easter	He buried himself inside her and [MASK] became a bud in spring. He lifted her legs and placed them over his shoulders and she blossomed and vainly preened for him, for the horsefly that watched from the wall, and the humming bird fluttering outside the open window.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alice	It took some doing, but the paring knife eventually accomplished the job and the lid popped off and went sailing across the floor. In the safety of her room [MASK] stared for a long time at the folded piece of yellowed paper before finally taking a deep breath and removing it from the tin.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Easter	[MASK] nodded and mused on how the word “unique” rolled off his Southern tongue. “Yes, that’s what they tell me.” Now he was hovering over her, staring down at the dark oily spots on her battered straw hat.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Meredith	“I want you to quit that job at the laundry,” [MASK] announced wistfully. “I’ve been thinking a lot about this and I just don’t see how you can concentrate on your writing if you’re toiling away in that awful place ten hours a day.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alice	“You know I don’t write stories anymore,” she said dryly. [MASK] thought herself sly—she claimed a stomachache, and to authenticate the claim she made sure her mother heard her retching in the bathroom.
<name>Shayla</name>	Shayla	Easter	“How do you think that made me feel?” One tear, as big as a raindrop, dribbled from the corner of [MASK]’s eye. “Don’t you start boo-hooing up in here, girl!”
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Colin	Including him. [MASK] shifted on the sofa, working hard to contain the anger that was bubbling in his stomach. He swallowed the liquor and the servant brought him another. “They’re good, but they’re raw. And raw is not a bad thing.
<name>Grimsby</name>	Grimsby	Hemp	As mean and black as the day was long, [MASK] had the body of a bulldog and his right eye was a cloud of cotton. He chose not to wear an eye patch; he liked the hideous look that damaged eye graced him with and the fear it struck in the hearts of men.
<name>she</name>	she	Alice	She didn’t know what to expect and her heart hammered with anticipation as she carefully undid the folds and smoothed out the creases. The ink was faded, but not so much that [MASK] couldn’t discern the letters or the word they formed: HATE.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Easter	“Can I help you up?” “Sure can,” [MASK] said, taking his waiting hand. “Go easy now.” He gently pulled and she gently pushed and together they got her old body upright. “You okay?”
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Shannon	“Yes, I’m sure. I’m absolutely sure.” [MASK] sighed. “I—I don’t know. If you’re wrong I mean it would just start a whole mess of trouble for nothing. You said she did what now?”
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Easter	“You don’t light that particular type of fire in me. You light a different fire. Don’t you see how I glow when you walk in the room? You calming to me like a easy summer day, you my rock, [MASK], don’t you know that?”
<name>Lola</name>	Lola	Rain	[MASK] tossed her head seductively to one side, kicked her leg out, pulled it back, rolled her hips, took three dainty steps toward the edge of the stage, and bent over the crowd so that the tops of her breasts peeked above the jewel neckline of the orange silk shift she wore.
<name>Mara</name>	Mara	Easter	When the soup kitchens ran out of food [MASK] rummaged for scraps in the garbage. Many a day she dined on her own spit and anger. So destitute was she that pride was an unaffordable luxury; and so she claimed a street comer and begged for change.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Easter	[MASK] did not remember charging at them, arms wheeling like propellers. Nor did she recall them trying to fend her off but failing, and slipping on the smooth porcelain belly of the tub, and crashing into a heap.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Easter	He asked, “Where have you been all these years?” [MASK] leaned back into her chair, folded her hands in her lap, and thought. She’d been so many places, had seen so many things.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Dobbs	“Oh gosh, you know how [MASK] is, he’ll blow a gasket if he finds out about this. I mean, if you steal a story what won’t you steal?” Her eyes wandered over to the Faberge egg and she wrung her hands.
<name>Ricardo</name>	Ricardo	Rain	“And he called you a puta!” [MASK] kissed her, a deep, passionate kiss that sent a lightning bolt of excitement through both of their bodies. “He wants you to go. He says you must be out by the time he returns.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Easter	He said they were going to the zoo, but his face was solemn and dark, an expression best suited for a visit to a funeral parlor or gravesite. They boarded the train and [MASK] rested her head on the window and watched the scenery peel by.
<name>John</name>	John	Dodd	When he glanced at his watch it told him that the bus was still late and his patience began to peel away. Five minutes later the sound of a diesel engine brought a sigh of relief from [MASK] and the others who were waiting for loved ones.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Shannon	“We have some leftover pot roast, julienne carrots, and mashed potatoes.” [MASK] tilted the oven door open, reached in, and pulled out a casserole dish. “I’ve been keeping it warm for you.”
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Shannon	Any real mother would have shown some hint of interest, anger, or alarm, but [MASK]’s only concern lay in the glass of gin and orange juice she clutched in her hand. And so she dismissed them with an exasperated roll of her eyes.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Easter	Another said, “So you think you better than me because you can read and write?” She didn’t think that at all. [MASK] tried not to take it personal, she understood why they taunted and ridiculed her the way they did—it distracted them from their own sorrows.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Chappo	And besides, her twelve-year-old son was coming into season so technically that would be two heads to clobber. And whether this girl knew it or not, she was with child and [MASK] didn’t do babies—and so the answer would have to be absolutely, positively no.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Shannon	“Yeah, pretty sure.” [MASK] leaned back and began moving her hands up and down her bare arms. It was eighty degrees in the house, but suddenly she felt chilled. “Pretty sure is not enough, you have to be absolutely sure.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Easter	The next door she tried revealed the butler standing before a full-length mirror, naked save for the expensive nylons and garter belt he wore. Caught by surprise, he reached for his hairbrush and threw it angrily at her. [MASK] stumbled along, giggling at the madness surrounding her.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Easter	She thought of the silverware, the Faberge egg, and the word “plagiarist,” and wrestled with the sheets and the blanket before tumbling out of bed and rushing to the window. She caught a glimpse of the bobbing purple flower as [MASK] made her way down the road.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Alice	She dropped the cloth into the water, dried her hands on her skirt, and bent to retrieve what she’d been staring at. “So this is the problem.” [MASK] looked at her underwear and blinked. “What is it?”
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Easter	Many a match had been made between a wash-and-rinse girl and corner boy. But [MASK] couldn’t be bothered with any of them. Her mind was set, she said, on something and someone higher.
<name>Ron</name>	Ron	Junior	Maybe this onehas manners, she thought as she moved to the buffet. Behind her [MASK] pointed and laughed, “Wow, your behind is as big as a bull cow’s!” After the life she’d led, few things surprised her.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Slocum	“This and that? Well that’s just what we been looking for!” [MASK] clapped his hands together and laughed. “Go on home now, ain’t nothing here for you.” He dismissed her with a quick wave of his hand.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Henry	“Worse?” “I could get killed,” [MASK] stated bluntly. But she wore him down with pleading and money and the promise of an automobile, and so he acquiesced, and the noose around his neck pulled tighter.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Roi	“Look what you got me doing. I’m so embarrassed.” “Don’t be,” [MASK] said, and waited patiently for her to compose herself before he leaned in and asked, “Are you still writing?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Easter	[MASK] wondered too, but when she met the men, it was immediately clear that any threat either of them ever presented had been beat out of them, poured, blended, and baked into humble pie decades earlier.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Meredith	When she began working over at [MASK]’s apartment, he held his tongue. But what started out as one night a week had progressed into two and then three, and now she was spending her one day off over there with them instead of with him, her husband.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Rain	He claimed that [MASK] was the only woman he’d ever loved and gave her a feathered boa to prove it, which turned out to be a poor substitute for an apology, since he was the one who’d sliced her neck in the first place.
<name>him</name>	him	Meredith	The dress she wore was old and the color faded. She wore dull hair pulled back into a ball. Her shoes were scuffed and the heels worn down to the nail. The servant brought him another drink without [MASK] having to tell her.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Colin	Can you type?” No she couldn’t, though she had seen it done. It looked simple enough. How hard could it be? “Yes.” [MASK] was drunk and could barely stand up when it came time for them to leave.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Alice	“What are you doing that for?” “Just being silly, sometimes you have to just be silly!” [MASK] was afraid for her. She felt a woman her size and her age shouldn’t be exerting herself in that fashion.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Meredith	“I won’t have it!” he barked, and brought his fist down onto the breakfast table. The eggs, bacon, and toast trembled on their porcelain plates and the coffee swilled over the edge of the gold-embossed cup. [MASK] batted her eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Easter	“Well you know, I told you all about that.” [MASK] nodded her head. “My uncle said it was only right that I go see the boy. Said children need to look on their parents even if they don’t know they’re parents.
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Easter	[MASK] had walked all through the night and only stopped to rest when the night sky began to flake away. She caught the scent of strong black coffee and followed it to a shack with a picnic table set out front.
<name>he</name>	he	Alice	She raised herself up onto the balls of her feet, planted both hands on her kneecaps, and proceeded to flap her legs together like wings. It was the most ridiculous dance [MASK] had ever seen. “What are you doing that for?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rain	Her grief was bottomless, and even though the streets teemed with people, she felt alone in the world. When she finally rounded the comer of her block, she looked up and saw [MASK] standing there, the ends of her bright yellow scarf fluttering in the late-aftemoon breeze.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Jack	[MASK] said, “None taken,” but his jaw was clenched. “And he’s in negotiations to purchase another vessel.” The two men exchanged looks of surprise. The smaller man laughed, “I’ve got to give it to him, he’s got heart.”
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Rain	[MASK]’s voice quivered with emotion. But it was already too late; both of their faces were wet when they finally embraced. In the luncheonette the buzz of conversation competed with the sizzle of hamburgers and cheese sandwiches on the cook’s grill.
<name>Jed</name>	Jed	Pretty	“[MASK] too, made it myself out of sassafras.” And with that he jerked his thumb toward a wagon that held a group of men sitting shoulder to shoulder, simmering beneath the scorching Panama sun. “Get outta my sight!”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Easter	And it was [MASK] who filled the tub with warm water and then said, “Come on in here,” with motherly authority. “Temperature just right and I put some of that bubble bath in there that you like.”
<name>She</name>	She	Easter	You the one that taught me that.” [MASK] patted the dirt affectionately. “Pardon?” She turned her head, eyed the fields across the road. “No, I haven’t,” she whispered, then picked up a pebble and tossed it aside.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Easter	“I can get you a job at the hair salon and I can’t see my landlady minding you staying with me until you got your own place.” [MASK] bit into the wedge of fruit and the sweet juice coated the inside of her cheek.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Madeline	“Yes?” “It’s [MASK].” “Yes?” “Can you come up here, please? I’d like to ask you something.” There was a long silence and then, “You can come down.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Easter	and then she offered a slight smile. “[MASK]?” Throw yourself at me, girl, wrap those arms around me, kiss me full on the lips—I don’t care who sees! But that didn’t happen.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Easter	“I said,” she began slowly, “I’ve been calling you for some time.” [MASK] rested the ladle down on the table and wiped at her eyes. “Sorry, just lost in my work, I guess.” “Really?”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Easter	In the kitchen [MASK] cussed under her breath, banged pots together, and dumped a whole tray of silverware into the sink. The family exchanged nervous glances and then one-by-one disappeared to different parts of the house.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Easter	The memories complained loudly and rapped incessantly on the wood, tempting her with the tinkering sounds of piano keys, gay laughter, and the clink of champagne flutes meeting in salute. They called to her, [MASK], come on out, girl!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Easter	The natural emotion should have been anger and embarrassment, but all [MASK] wanted to do was cry. She looked up at her husband and her eyes asked what her mouth couldn’t: Why did you bring me here?
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Easter	No matter how many times they bathed, the smell of detergent clung stubbornly to their hair and skin, yet [MASK] arrived every day smelling of expensive perfume. Why did she continue to work there? Was it to rub their faces in her happiness and good fortune?
<name>Harper</name>	Harper	Nancy	and I don’t understand how it’s used so freely here in this country. It’s bounced around like a child’s ball. And to use it in literature, in the very thing that should bring the races together...” [MASK] shook her head in dismay.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Cohn	“Wutless,” [MASK] said, taking her by the hands and leading her onto the dance floor. He schooled her body in the art of his dance, resting his large palms on her slim hips, guiding them gently into the musical surf.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Easter	The assailant appeared, his head bowed and his wrists cuffed at his back. Two brawny policemen stood on either side of him, their hands wrapped tight around his arms. They yanked him down the steps, toward the paddy wagon. [MASK] stood on the tips of her toes.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Alice	She walked over and pulled the French doors closed. [MASK] stood staring at the closed doors and an eerie feeling crept over her. Something was wrong, she thought, as she headed out of the house. Something was very wrong.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Easter	They moved closer until they were right up front and [MASK] found herself staring at a man, who gazed back at her from the opposite side of the metal bars. She thought her mind was playing a cruel trick on her eyes, but when she blinked he was still there.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Easter	“Your friend know you pregnant?” Goddamit, [MASK] thought, she didn’t even know herself until three days ago. “No ma’am.” “What are your intentions?” She hadn’t really thought about it. “I ain’t judging you.
<name>She</name>	She	Easter	“Well, why in the world you going there then? You got a job waiting for you?” [MASK] shook her head. “I don’t understand.” She didn’t understand either. “Just some place new I guess.”
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Easter	[MASK] sighed, turned the television off, went into the bathroom, and shut the door. The memories complained loudly and rapped incessantly on the wood, tempting her with the tinkering sounds of piano keys, gay laughter, and the clink of champagne flutes meeting in salute.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Lovely	When the weather was fair and the sky like glass above their heads, they hooted and hollered out, “[MASK], not even a smile? Oooh, you’re breaking my heart!” On crisp days they bowed low and made great sweeping gestures with their hands.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Olga	In her hands she held sheet music, her thin lips moving soundlessly to the melody. “Momin’, ma’am.” [MASK]’s eyes remained fixed on the stanza. “Who sent you here?” “My aunt.” “And who is your aunt?”
<name>He</name>	He	Colin	“Home.” “You coming back?” “No.” Minutes later, she was hit with the shakes so bad that she barely made it up the stairs and into bed. When [MASK] finally came home, his eyes were bloodshot and watery.
<name>Coralee</name>	Coralee	Easter	Most Sundays she went to the sanctified church, not to pray—she could do that anywhere and at any time— but to be enveloped in the language, to revel in the music, to be swept up in the rapture. Sunday service was sustenance and [MASK] often found her mouth agape, tongue lapping.
<name>Barnaby</name>	Barnaby	Slocum	[MASK], the short, round, dimple-cheeked proprietor, bounded onto the stage and cast his toothless grin over the crowd before joyfully announcing: “Women hold onto your husbands, men hold tight to your hats, a storm is coming that I guarantee will leave you soaking wet!”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Colin	“You’re drunk.” [MASK]’s bottom lip hung recklessly from his face. “That may be, but a drunk tongue speaks a sober mind,” he said, as he dropped down into the chair and reached for the glass of whiskey.
<name>She</name>	She	Easter	He smirked at her and all four walls of that room collapsed. He smirked and the earth yawned and all but the two of them slipped down its grainy throat. [MASK] felt her mouth go dry and she reached for the water glass and brought it carefully to her lips.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Easter	“Thank you.” The bathroom, with its blue and white flowered tile, had a pleasant feel about it. A small potted cactus sat on the windowsill. [MASK] washed her hands, threw water onto her face, and rinsed her mouth clean.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Easter	How had he missed it all this time? “I don’t understand why you don’t hate them.” They’d had this conversation a million times. And the thought of revisiting it yet again made [MASK] weary. “They raped your sister.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Rain	“That was it for me.” [MASK]’s voice seemed to come from a great distance. She leaned back into the pillowed leather backing of the booth, turned her head, and blew a thin stream of smoke into the aproned hip of a passing waitress.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Easter	I don’t write my e that way, or my s or my a. The letter was an accumulation of her unraveling that had started on the school day when [MASK] looked down to find that she was wearing one brown shoe and one black shoe.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Harmon	[MASK] shook his head. “How do you know that this is her first attempt at a novel? Writers die all the time, leaving behind volumes of unpublished and unseen work!” “You have a point.” “This novel goes far above mimicry.”
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Shannon	And look at this house! It’s just beautiful, yes it is. You’ve done real good for yourself, honey, real good.” “I guess,” [MASK] sniffed. “Two wonderful kids, a nice comfortable home, a hard-working husband.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Easter	Once they were inside his grip tightened around her hand as he edged his way through the throng of fascinated onlookers. [MASK] could see bright orange fur and huge droopy eyes pressed into an elongated face. An orangutan? He brought her ah this way to see an orangutan?
<name>Zeke</name>	Zeke	Slocum	“I need a job.” The words jumped out of her mouth and landed on the ground between them. [MASK] grunted, slipped his hands behind the bib of the overalls he wore, and rocked back on his heels. “Oh, really now?
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Meredith	I mean it, no more!” His arm swept through the air and knocked over a crystal vase filled with geraniums. The butler appeared in a flash, cloth in hand, and began to attend to the mess. [MASK] stiffened.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Easter	Oh yes, [MASK] has spoken of you. So nice to finally meet you.” Her hand was warm, her grip strong. “Same here.” “Can I get you something to drink? A Coca-Cola?” “Sure, thanks.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Easter	[MASK] remained stone-faced and silent. There was no use trying to speak to him while he was in that state. And she realized as they climbed off the trolley and started up the street that he was in that state more and more frequently.
<name>Marcus</name>	Marcus	Jack	UNIA members were scurrying about tidying up and assessing the damage. [MASK] stepped gingerly over the jagged pieces of mirrored glass and wood and sidled up to the shaken woman who had dealt the crippling blow. “What happened here?”
