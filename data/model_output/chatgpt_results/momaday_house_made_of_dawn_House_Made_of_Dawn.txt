<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Abel	[MASK] waited, listening. He tried to think of what to do. He wanted earlier, in the dawn, to speak to his grandfather, but he could think of nothing to say. He listened to the feeble voice that rose out of the darkness, and he waited helplessly.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Milly	When [MASK] heard that, the way he told it, she got so tickled she didn’t know what to do. She couldn’t stop laughing, and pretty soon we had to laugh, too. And then she got the hiccups, and that just made it worse.
<name>Juana</name>	Juana	Angela	The priest paused among them, and [MASK] drew away from him a little. She was among the houses of the town, and there was an excitement all around, a ceaseless murmur under the sound of the drum, lost in back of the walls, apart from the dead silent light of the afternoon.
<name>Tewa</name>	Tewa	Santiago	And accordingly [MASK] tore the bird apart with his bare hands and scattered the remains all about on the ground. The blood and feathers of the bird became cultivated plants and domestic animals, enough for all the Pueblo people.
<name>It</name>	It	Tosamah	He stumbled backward and fell against the sink. He was looking for [MASK], and it was a bad, scary look, but he couldn’t get his eyes to hold still, you know, and he couldn’t move.
<name>Manuel</name>	Manuel	Abel	Later she lay down upon a table and the attendant wrapped her in light cotton blankets and she dozed. When she returned to the Benevides house, [MASK] was sitting on the front stoop—not waiting, it seemed—still and stolid.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Abel	He leaned inside the white man’s arms and drove the blade up under the bones of the breast and across. The white man’s hands lay on [MASK]’s shoulders, and for a moment the white man stood very still.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Milly	Her skin was white and clean, and she put her feet down under the sand and wiggled her toes. He had been trying for a couple of days to straighten himself out, talking about getting a job and all. [MASK] believed him, and I guess I did, too.
<name>Jim's</name>	Jim's	Abel	He had shivered all morning and complained of the cold, though there was a fire in the room and he lay under three blankets and [MASK]’s gray coat. At noon he had fallen into a coma again, as he had yesterday and the day before.
<name>San Geronimo</name>	San Geronimo	Santiago	The blood and feathers of the bird became cultivated plants and domestic animals, enough for all the Pueblo people. The late afternoon of the feast of [MASK] was still and hot, and there were no clouds in the sky.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Abel	Most of the animals were untrained, and they drew up when their riders leaned. One and then another of the boys fell to the ground, and the townspeople jeered in delight. When it came [MASK]’s turn, he made a poor showing, full of caution and gesture.
<name>John</name>	John	Vidal	[MASK] took him to the face of the red mesa and into a narrow box canyon which he had never seen before. The bright red walls were deep, deeper than he could have imagined, and they seemed to close over him.
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Abel	“You must bury him.” “Dead? Oh . . . yes—yes, of course. But, good heavens, couldn’t you have waited until—” “My grandfather is dead,” [MASK] repeated. His voice was low and even.
<name>Sandy</name>	Sandy	Milly	It had been kind of cold and foggy all that week, but that day it was clear and warm, and we were feeling good and kind of lazy out there. [MASK] had been in the water, and she came over and sat down between us.
<name>The Misfit</name>	The Misfit	Martinez	I told him his name and said he was out of work; he was looking for a job and didn’t have any money. [MASK] told him to hold out his hands, and he did, slowly, like maybe he wasn’t going to at first, with the palms up.
<name>Stonewall</name>	Stonewall	Abel	The mares went a little faster on the way home, and near the bridge a yellow dog came out to challenge them. JULY 21 C. [MASK] slept through the day and night in his grandfather’s house. With the first light of dawn he arose and went out.
<name>Hemingway</name>	Hemingway	Milly	“It was good again, [MASK].” “It was lovely. I love you.” They made love in the afternoons when she came home early from work. Sometimes he wasn’t there when she came in, and she knew that he was drunk again, sick, in trouble maybe.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Milly	I thought about eating something. [MASK] brought some groceries up here yesterday; she’s always doing that, and it comes out of her own pocket, too. We put some cheese and crackers and a couple of candy bars in that sack he had.
<name>he</name>	he	Abel	The man’s mouth opened as if to say something, and for a moment he stopped and stared; then he walked away, hurriedly, out of sight. Now and then [MASK] stopped to rest, and a dizziness came over him and he had to go on.
<name>beat</name>	beat	Angela	Just there, in sight of him, the deep vibration of the drum seemed to [MASK] scarcely louder, deeper, than it had an hour before and a half mile away, when she was in a room of the rectory, momentarily alone with it and borne upon it.
<name>Wendy</name>	Wendy	Milly	The thing I remember most clearly is----. As a child I enjoyed----- Someday I shall______ People who laugh loudly are----- etc. [MASK]? “No test is completely valid,” she said. “Some are more valid than others.”
<name>Mrs. Price</name>	Mrs. Price	Carlozini	That’s the first thing I saw, that the window was open and the rain was coming in and the sill was dripping inside. I felt bad about that, forgetting to close the window, because the floor leaks and that old woman [MASK] downstairs, she gets pretty mad.
<name>she</name>	she	Angela	Then he faced her, and [MASK] saw that under his hat the pale yellow hair was thin and cut close to the scalp; the tight skin of the head was visible and pale and pink. The face was huge and mottled white and pink, and the thick, open lips were blue and violet.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Abel	He could see her reflection, like a silhouette, in an oval mirror on the wall. When she faced him again, they were both naked. For a minute they stood still in the soft blue light. [MASK] studied her, but she did not cringe.
<name>he</name>	he	Abel	Smiling in a kind of transport, the Priest of the Sun stood silent for a time while the congregation waited to be dismissed. “Good night,” he said, at last, “and get yours.” Why should [MASK] think of the fishes?
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Abel	One of the arms lay out from the body; it was there, in the pale angle of the white man’s death, that [MASK] knelt. The sleeve had been cut away, and the whole length of the arm and the open palm of the hand were exposed.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Tosamah	I got to thinking about it, though, anyway. About him; about him being afraid of that man out there, so afraid he didn’t know what to do. That, you know, being so scared of something like that—that’s what [MASK] doesn’t understand.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Tosamah	It was like that time at [MASK]’s place, you know? He didn’t say anything—and even when it happened he didn’t say anything; he just doubled over down there against the wall and held his hands—but he couldn’t forget about it.
<name>Cherry</name>	Cherry	Milly	We had some good times—a few, even after that. Sometimes [MASK] would come around in the morning on Sundays, and she would bring a basket with maybe some sandwiches and Kool-Aid and apples and cookies inside.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Vidal	he had yelled when he was five years old, and he climbed up on the horse behind [MASK] and they went out with their grandfather and the others—some in wagons, but most on foot and horseback—across the river to the cacique’s field.
<name>Mrs. Foley</name>	Mrs. Foley	Henry	There was nobody around. I couldn’t hear anybody, and the stairs were dark. I forgot to get some matches at [MASK]’s place, and I had to feel my way up the stairs. When I came in here, the window was open.
<name>Joe's</name>	Joe's	Henry	He didn’t come back for three days. I went right home from work every day and he wasn’t there. I kept going down to [MASK]’s place and all around, back and forth, and nobody had seen him. He wasn’t in jail.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Francisco	But farther on there was blood, and then the doe itself, lying across the trunk of a dead tree with its tongue out and smoking and the wound full of hot blood, welling out. [MASK] had already hitched the team to the wagon, and they set out.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Frazer	It was hot, and it was getting on toward late afternoon, and you didn’t feel much like walking the rest of the way home. You were kind of hoping that your grandfather might be coming for water, but [MASK] said that he had been there the day before.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Abel	[MASK] heard the strange excitement of the white man’s breath, and the quick, uneven blowing at his ear, and felt the blue shivering lips upon him, felt even the scales of the lips and the hot slippery point of the tongue, writhing.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Cruz	It all happened real quick, and [MASK] started to laugh, and then the others did, too; and that seemed to take all the fight out of him. It was like he had to give up when they laughed; it was like all of a sudden he didn’t care about anything anymore.
<name>Odysseus</name>	Odysseus	Santiago	When he had journeyed a long way, he stopped to rest at the house of an old man and his wife. They were poor and miserable people, but they were kind and gracious, too, and they bade [MASK] welcome.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Medina	But it was all right; it was good, that dance, nearly perfect. Later, when he had drunk some wine, one of [MASK]’s daughters lay down with him outside of the town, on a dune by the river.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tosamah	One night I was up here by myself—he was out someplace— and [MASK] came in. I didn’t much want to talk to him, you know, because he’s always showing off and making fun of things.
<name>probably</name> (Note: There is no proper name that fits the context of the sentence, so the answer is a guess based on the surrounding words.)	probably (Note: There is no proper name that fits the context of the sentence, so the answer is a guess based on the surrounding words.)	Daniels	He didn’t say anything, [MASK], but just swore a couple of times and left me alone. I’m pretty sure he didn’t believe me. The orders kept coming in and we weren’t catching up at all. He was passed out when I got home.
<name>George</name>	George	Benally	“Who’s your friend, [MASK]?” And he stepped in front of him and held the light up to his face. I told him his name and said he was out of work; he was looking for a job and didn’t have any money.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Abel	The Navajos became aware of him. And throughout [MASK] smiled; he nodded and grew silent at length; and the smile was thin and instinctive, a hard, transparent mask upon his mouth and eyes. He waited, and the wine rose up in his blood.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Santiago	He gave them his blessing and continued on his way. He rode on for many days, and at last he came to the royal city. That day the king proclaimed that there should be a great celebration and many games, dangerous contests of skill and strength. [MASK] entered the games.
<name>Witch</name>	Witch	Francisco	But once he had fallen from a horse, and for days afterward there was a sharp, recurrent pain in the small of his back. [MASK] chanted and prayed; the old man applied herbs and powders and potions and salves, and nothing worked.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Milly	“Yes,” I said. And she asked me what it was like to die, and I answered, “I don’t know.” “I love you, [MASK],” she said; she had never called me by my name before.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Francisco	[MASK]’s crippled leg nearly gave way. His good straw hat fell off and he braced himself against the weight of his grandson. Tears came to his eyes, and he knew only that he must laugh and turn away from the faces in the windows of the bus.
<name>Mr. McArdle</name>	Mr. McArdle	Daniels	[MASK] never found out, or I guess I would have been fired. Well, it was a nice day, and he was just sitting around up here, like he didn’t know what to do, so I told him to come on and he seemed pretty glad to go.
<name>Doodle</name>	Doodle	Francisco	It was terribly thin and colorless, but all the pain was gone from it. Then, under his breath and because he was alone, he spoke his brother’s name. [MASK] nudged him awake, and he dressed himself in the bitter cold.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Carrie	And [MASK] was four. She was crying and I went into her room and she was burning up with fever, and in the night she had gone sallow and pale and weak. Her voice was strange and thin, and there were dark circles under her eyes.
<name>father</name>	father	Vidal	The disease which killed his mother and [MASK] never even touched him, as far as he knew. But once he had fallen from a horse, and for days afterward there was a sharp, recurrent pain in the small of his back.
<name>her</name>	her	Milly	The liquor didn’t seem to make any difference; he was just the same, sitting around and looking down like he hated everything, like he hated himself and hated being drunk and hated [MASK] and me, and I couldn’t talk to him.
<name>he</name>	he	Tosamah	He was on parole, and he had to do everything right the first time. That made it a lot harder for him; he wasn’t as lucky as the rest of us. He was going to get us all in trouble, [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cruz	The people had filed into the pews and were waiting silently. [MASK], a squat, oily man with blue-black hair that stood out like spines from his head, stepped forward on the platform and raised his hands as if to ask for the quiet that already was.
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	Abelito	Never before had he been away from the dance. “[MASK],” he said again, and he began to hoe the rows. The long afternoon went on around him, and he was alone in the fields. He knew only that he was alone again.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Vidal	He did not know who his father was. His father was a Navajo, they said, or a Sia, or an Isleta, an outsider anyway, which made him and his mother and [MASK] somehow foreign and strange.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Nicolas	Something frightened him. There was an old woman. They called her [MASK] teah-whau because she had a white mustache and a hunched back and she would beg for whiskey on the side of the road. She was a Bahkyush woman, they said, and a witch.
<name>he</name>	he	Catherine	I have friends & patrons before you be assured & they have some better claim & to be true I scarce can get you in. You had better think hard on it your need & mine. Confide in me if it be so that [MASK] does speak ill of me.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Tosamah	One night after we had worked a twelve-hour day, we went over to [MASK]’s place and got up a poker game. There were five or six of us, I guess, and we were all drinking a lot and having fun.
<name>John Ames</name>	John Ames	Abel	It lay open in his hands like a rare and wounded bird, more beautiful than broken, and with it he performed the mild spiritual exercise that always restored him to faith and humility. [MASK] sat in the dark of his grandfather’s house.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Angela	There was an instant in which the coil of his body was set and all his strength was poised in the breach of time, then the infinite letting go. He leaned into the swing and drove; the blade flashed and struck, and the wood gaped open. [MASK] 31
<name>he</name>	he	Milly	There’s quite a bit left, I guess, some bread and some cans of chili and stuff. But I wasn’t very hungry, and I had that bottle of wine. Now that he’s gone, I don’t know if [MASK]’s going to come around anymore.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Benally	“Your hands, [MASK], they’re shaking,” he said, like he wondered why and was worried about it. He made me keep my hands there for a long time in the bright light, and they were shaking bad and I couldn’t hold them still.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tosamah	And, sure enough, pretty soon he just flew off the handle. It was like everything just exploded inside of him, and he jumped up from the table and started for [MASK]. But he was crazy drunk, and he couldn’t stay on his feet.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Abel	He heard the sharp wheeze of the brakes as the big bus rolled to a stop in front of the gas pump, and only then did he give attention to it, as if it had taken him by surprise. The door swung open and [MASK] stepped heavily to the ground and reeled.
<name>He</name>	He	Francisco	The eyes were neither open nor closed. [MASK] was disappointed, for he had wished for a male mountain bluebird, breast feathers the pale color of April skies or of turquoise, lake water. Or a summer tanager: a prayer plume ought to be beautiful.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Santiago	The rooster was their only possession of value, but the old man and woman killed and cooked it for their guest. That night they gave him their bed while they slept on the cold ground. When morning came, [MASK] told them who he was.
<name>Rowdy</name>	Rowdy	Abel	Tears came to his eyes, and he knew only that he must laugh and turn away from the faces in the windows of the bus. He held [MASK] upright and led him to the wagon, listening as the bus moved away at last and its tires began to sing upon the road.
<name>he</name>	he	Abel	There was no one to wish him well or tell him how it would be, and [MASK] put his hands in his pockets and waited. He had been ready for hours, and he was restless, full of excitement and the dread of going. It was time.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Henry	We were coming home one night from [MASK]’s place. We had been standing around outside with a lot of other guys, and we were talking pretty loud and having a big time, you know, but after a while it broke up, and it was late and we decided to come on home.
<name>he</name>	he	Abel	He motioned again, and [MASK] followed. From the top of the drift they could see a good stretch of the river; at the far reaches it gleamed and glittered like crumpled foil, but directly below it was black and invisible, for there was a long thicket of willows and tamarack on the opposite bank.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Francisco	It is hot in the end of July. The old man [MASK] drove a team of roan mares near the place where the river bends around a cottonwood. The sun shone on the sand and the river and the leaves of the tree, and waves of heat shimmered from the stones.
<name>Conrad</name>	Conrad	Milly	[MASK]? He was afraid. He heard the sea breaking, saw shadowy shapes in the swirling fog, and he was afraid. He had always been afraid. Forever at the margin of his mind there was something to be afraid of, something to fear.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Angela	He reined in hard, so that the animal tucked in its haunches and its hoofs plowed in the ground. [MASK] thrilled to see it handled so, as if the white man were its will and all its shivering force were drawn to his bow.
<name>The Shadow</name>	The Shadow	Vidal	The gleam of metal caught his eye, and he saw [MASK] taking aim into the darkness. He flinched in anticipation of the shot and searched the river below. He could see nothing at first. But even before the gun roared, the black water shattered and crawled.
<name>Jumbo</name>	Jumbo	Vincenzo	“His name is [MASK],” she said. “He’s very smart, you know; he can stand up straight, just like you gentlemen, and clap his little hands.” And her eyes lit up and she had to smile, thinking about it.
<name>Ceremony</name>	Ceremony	Beautyway	“House made of dawn.” I used to tell him about those old ways, the stories and the sings, [MASK] and Night Chant. I sang some of those things, and I told him what they meant, what I thought they were about.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Milly	He would kind of dodge around, then let out a whoop and do a goddam two-step or something and light out again, giving it to them behind and underhand, and them goddam bullets going pop, pop, ping, ping, pow. Oh Jesus, sir. Jesus!” [MASK]?
<name>my boss</name>	my boss	Daniels	I guess she could see that I was pretty worried, and after a while she brought me a cup of coffee. Later, I remembered about going to work, and I called in and told [MASK] that I was sick. He said O.K. I waited all day.
<name>the soldier</name>	the soldier	Bowker	Forever at the margin of his mind there was something to be afraid of, something to fear. He did not know what it was, but it was always there, real, imminent, unimaginable. “He was not afraid, no, sir,” [MASK] said.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Pony	[MASK], they called her, and she laughed, and her skin was light and she had long little hands and she wore a dark blue velveteen blouse and a corn-blossom necklace with an old najahe like the moon and one perfect powder-blue stone. . . .
<name>Magua</name>	Magua	hale	It is dead & raw about its eyes & mouth tho’ otherways [MASK] I think & there is a meager white hair on its head like an old man & its crying is very little to hear. I advise to baptize this same day & do so at 3 o’clock.
<name>Trash</name>	Trash	Vincenzo	She didn’t say any more, and she wasn’t crying; it was like she was real tired, you know, and didn’t have any strength left. I asked her if she wanted us to take [MASK] out to the alley, but she just sat there and didn’t say anything.
<name>Bono</name>	Bono	Tosamah	He’s always going on about Relocation and Welfare and Termination and all, and that little fat Cruz is always right behind him, smiling and nodding like he knew what it was all about. I used to listen to [MASK].
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Abel	[MASK] could barely see it then, the dark shape floating away in the blackness. And when he waded after it, the current was slow and steady and there was no sound on the river. The bird held still in the cold black water, watching him.
<name>Blondie</name>	Blondie	Henry	It was kind of hard for him, you know, getting used to everything. We had to get down there pretty early and put in a day’s work. And then at night we would go down to [MASK]’s place and fool around.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Abel	[MASK] was not used to the game, and the white man was too strong and quick for him. The roan mare lunged, but it was hemmed in against the wall; the black horse lay close against it, keeping it off balance, coiled and wild in its eyes.
<name>John Steinbeck</name>	John Steinbeck	Abel	They have assumed the names and gestures of their enemies, but have held on to their own, secret souls; and in this there is a resistance and an overcoming, a long outwaiting. [MASK] walked into the canyon.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frazer	You were little and there was a lot to see, and all of it was new and beautiful: bright new buckets and tubs, saddles and ropes, hats and shirts and boots, a big glass case all filled with candy. [MASK] was the trader’s name.
<name>alive</name>	alive	Lazarus	The wonder of it. I see in my diary it is 10 years & more since you came to me on my deathbed & gave me your richest blessing. Truly I am [MASK] & you the witness of it. You may say with me as it is writ Cor.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Vincenzo	We turned and she was looking up at us and her eyes were all wet. “[MASK] is not well,” she said. “It is very bad this time.” She had a little cardboard box in her hands and she held it out to us.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Padre	The muscles twitched under the fat and the head turned slowly from side to side in the agony of sad and helpless laughter. Then the wall of dust descended upon the face, and the cries of the children became a shrill and incessant chant: “[MASK]!
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Angela	[MASK] caught her breath, and after a long moment she came to him. She bent down and kissed him, and he put his hands on her and drew her close against him. She felt the strength of his hands and the heat of his body.
<name>he</name>	he	Mariano	“Well, you were early after all,” she said, “and [MASK] had not done with me.” “Come,” he said, and he took her breasts in his hands and moved against her and kissed her mouth.
<name>the narrator's brother</name>	the narrator's brother	Vidal	He crept along behind his brother, bending low and weaving after him through the brush-covered dunes, going silently on the cold ripples of sand. And [MASK] took smaller, higher steps as they approached the water and held the gleaming shotgun ready, perfectly balanced and slightly away from his body.
<name>He</name>	He	Juan	Then he [MASK] shoveled earth on her but it was frozen under the sand & hard to break the big pieces & some I thought would have given her hurt if she had been alive. Evening. Am I not yet constrained into Thee?
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Benally	They pay your way; they get you a job and a place to stay; I guess they even take care of you if you get sick. You don’t have to worry about a thing. “No, sirree, [MASK], you don’t have to worry about a thing.”
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Milly	He was unlucky. You could see that right away. You could see that he wasn’t going to get along around here. [MASK] thought he was going to be all right, I guess, but she didn’t understand how it was with him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Daniels	We were short-handed for a while, and we had to put in a lot of overtime. [MASK]—he’s the foreman—was getting pretty nervous, I guess, because a lot of orders were coming in, and we were running pretty far behind.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Daniels	Now you know it’s hard to work like that, with somebody important watching you all the time, and I could see that he was starting to sweat. He made a couple of mistakes, and [MASK] got on him right away.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Abelito	Their feet fell upon the earth in perfect time, and their eyes were solemn and looked straight ahead. And the single deep voice of the singers lay upon the dance, lay even upon the valley and the earth, whole and inscrutable, everlasting. “[MASK].”
