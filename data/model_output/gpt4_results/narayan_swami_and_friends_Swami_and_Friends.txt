<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Granny	A boy in First C stabbed another in the forearm with a penknife.’ ‘What for?’ asked [MASK] mechanically. ‘They were enemies.’ Finding that it fell flat, he brought out the big event of the day.
<name>Challoner</name>	Challoner	Rajam	He stood still, his club down. ‘You heard the shot?’ asked [MASK]. ‘The next is going to be into your body, if you are keen upon a fight.’ ‘But this is unfair. I have no gun while you have. . .
<name>Swaminathan</name>	Swaminathan	Swaminathan	[MASK] sat impatiently in his ‘study’, trying to wrest the meaning out of a poem in his English Reader. His father stood before the mirror, winding a turban round his head. He had put on his silk coat. Now only his spectacles remained.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mani	And then a country cart drawn by bullocks passed, the cart-man humming a low tune. It was some fifteen minutes past sunset and there was a soft red in the west. ‘The water runs very deep here, doesn’t it?’ [MASK] asked.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Swaminathan	When [MASK]’s father gave his wife the news—or no news—that he had gathered from his wanderings, he had assumed a heavy aggressive cheerfulness. It had lasted for a while, but gradually the anxiety and the nervousness of the two women infected him.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Swami	You are a peculiar fellow.’ ‘What else could I do to get the evenings off for practice? The Y.M.U. are no joke.’ ‘You are right, [MASK]. I watched the fellows at practice this morning. They have morning practice too.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	After that he read out the names of those that had kept away, and asked them to stand on their benches. He felt that that punishment was not enough and asked them to stand on their desks. [MASK] was among them and felt humiliated at that eminence.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Swaminathan	[MASK] heard the clicking of the bolts. He sat at the window, watched his father turn the corner, and then left his post. His mother was in the kitchen giving instructions to the cook about the afternoon coffee.
<name>Bindle</name>	Bindle	Rajam	‘Has he a dog?’ asked [MASK]. ‘Not any that I could see.’ ‘Then why not rush into his house and kick him?’ ‘It is all very well to say that. I tremble whenever I go to see him.
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Rama	Oh, [MASK]! Give me six paise and I will give up biting my thumb for a year. . .’ He wandered aimlessly in the backyard persuading himself that in a few minutes he could return to the pooja room and take his money—transmuted pebbles.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	‘Sir, have you any explanation to give?’ the headmaster asked. With difficulty [MASK] found his voice and answered: ‘It was the doctor—didn’t the doctor talk to you about me, sir?’ ‘What doctor talk about what?’
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Rajam	‘You have ruined the M.C.C. You need not have promised us, if you had wanted to funk. At least you could have told us you were going away. Why did you hide it from [MASK] when you saw him at our school?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Swami	She stepped into the room with the declaration, ‘[MASK] has fever, and he can’t go to school.’ ‘Did you take his temperature?’ ‘Not yet. It doesn’t matter if he misses the school for a day.’
<name>Sonia</name>	Sonia	Mani	He waited for a second and repeated it. The door-chain clanked, the door opened a little, and [MASK]’s head appeared and said: ‘Fool! My aunt is here, don’t come in. Go away and wait for me there.’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rajam	At the sound of the creaking of boots, they turned and found that [MASK] had come. He was dressed in khaki, and carried under his arm an airgun that was given to him a couple of months ago on his birthday.
<name>schoolboys</name>	schoolboys	Swaminathans	He fumbled for his spectacles and put them on. Now the picture was complete—wizened face and dingy spectacles calculated to strike terror into the hearts of [MASK]. He asked again, ‘To what class do you fellows belong? Have you no class?’
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Swaminathan	He feared that his wife might detect the sarcasm in his suggestion, and added as a palliative, ‘That we may know whether a doctor is necessary.’ A thermometer stuck out of [MASK]’s mouth for half a minute and indicated normal.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rajam	The headmaster sank back in his chair and remained silent. [MASK] asked again, ‘What do you say, sir, won’t you do it?’ ‘Are you the headmaster of this school or am I?’ ‘Of course you are the headmaster, sir.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rajam	He would have to come back on the day of the match, without anybody’s knowledge. Perhaps it would not be necessary. He asked suddenly: ‘[MASK], do you think I am so necessary for the match?’
<name>Andrei</name>	Andrei	Raju	‘Remove it from the table, you—’ he roared at the cook. The cook removed it and placed it on a chair. ‘You dirty ass, take it away, don’t put it there.’ ‘Where am I to put it, [MASK]?’
<name>Swaminathan</name>	Swaminathan	Rajam	He had promised to bring the real stumps. It was half an hour past time and yet he was not to be seen anywhere. At last his puny figure was discovered in the distance. There was a catch in [MASK]’s heart when he saw him.
<name>Yankel</name>	Yankel	Rajam	He was thinking: he was going to break [MASK]’s head in a short while and throw his body into the river. But if it should be recovered? But then how could they know that he had done it?
<name>Swaminathan</name>	Swaminathan	Mani	When you get eyesore the only thing you can do is to take a slice of raw onion. . .’ [MASK] realized that the other would not stop, and butted in. ‘There is only a week more for the examinations, sir. .
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Swaminathan	He vanished for a moment and reappeared with a small bottle in his hand. He hovered about uncertainly. The hushed voices, hurry, seriousness, agitation, hot water, and medicine— preparations for ushering a new person into the world—were too bewildering for [MASK]’s comprehension.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	His father fussed about a little for his tiny silver snuff-box and the spotted kerchief, which was the most unwashed thing in that house. He hooked his umbrella on his arm. This was really the last signal for starting. [MASK] had almost closed the book and risen.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Swaminathan	‘Hallo, [MASK], what is the matter?’ ‘Nothing, sir. I have come on a little business.’ ‘All well at home?’ ‘Quite. Doctor, I have got to have a doctor’s certificate immediately.’
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Swami	If his voice was heard anywhere after the Taluk Office gong had struck nine, a command would come from his father’s room, ‘[MASK], why haven’t you gone to bed yet? You must get up early and study a bit.’
<name>Wells</name>	Wells	Mani	As soon as he received the note, he had an impulse to run home. And when he expressed it, [MASK] took him in his hands, propelled him through to the headmaster’s room, and gave him a gentle push in.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Rajam	What was he to do in the evenings? How was he to spend the holiday afternoons? Whom was he to think of as his friend? At the same time he was filled with a sense of guilt: he had not gone and seen [MASK] even once after his return.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Mani	‘Why are you so wild?’ ‘It was your fault,’ said [MASK] vehemently, ‘I didn’t know—’ He looked around. ‘Well, well. I didn’t ask you to crawl and bark, did I?’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	Why was there such a lot of noise in the class? Let them go on making a noise and they would get a clean, big zero in the examination. He would see to that. . . [MASK] paid no attention to the rest of the lessons.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Mani	In his despair he felt that at least six more would follow suit without raising the score to twenty. And then he and [MASK] would be left. And he had a wild momentary hope that each might be able to get forty with a few judicious sixers and boundaries.
<name>Quilp</name>	Quilp	Swaminathan	And now from the hovel that [MASK] had pointed out as the coachman’s, emerged a little man of three feet or so, ill-clad and unwashed. He pushed his way through the crowd and, securing a fine place, sucked his thumb and watched the fight in rapture.
<name>bandits</name>	bandits	Pathans	But he could tell them that he had lost his way. Or would that be too mild? Suppose he said that he had been kidnapped by [MASK] and had to escape from them with great difficulty. . . He felt he had been walking long enough.
<name>Gerda</name>	Gerda	Swaminathan	Providentially a fresh supply of water from the kitchen in the neighbour’s house pushed it from behind out of danger. But it rushed on at a fearful speed, and [MASK] felt that it was going to turn turtle. Presently it calmed, and resumed a normal speed.
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Swaminathan	But how can everyone be a son of a police superintendent?’ With that he was off. This was probably [MASK]’s first shock in life. It paralysed all his mental process. When his mind started working again, he faintly wondered if he had been dreaming.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	Not a word reached [MASK]’s brain, in which there was only dull pain and vacuity. If he had been questioned he would have blundered and would have had to spend the rest of the hour standing on the bench. But his luck was good.
<name>William</name>	William	Rajam	Though as M.C.C. it sounded imposing, the name was really a bit tame. ‘I think we had better try some other name, [MASK].’ ‘What would you suggest?’ ‘Well—I am for “Friends Eleven”.’ ‘Friends Eleven?’
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Swaminathan	So I don’t think this letter could mean a refusal to supply us goods.’ [MASK] agreed with him, ‘That is right. If he did not wish to supply you with things, would he thank you? He would have abused you.’
<name>Ratnakar</name>	Ratnakar	Rajam	He then started giving hair-raising accounts of what hell had in store for persons who fostered enmity. According to [MASK], it was written in the Vedas that a person who fostered enmity should be locked up in a small room, after his death.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	Are you not ashamed of yourself?’ [MASK] picked up the oily red-bound Fourth Reader, opened it, and banged together the covers in order to shake off the dust, and then rubbed violently the oily covers with his palm. ‘Get a piece of cloth, boy.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	The headmaster threw out his arm and twisted [MASK]’s neck to make him face the class, and said: ‘This great man is too busy to bother about such trivial matters as drill and scouting, and has not honoured these classes with his presence since last Monday.’
<name>Ramprasad</name>	Ramprasad	Singaram	[MASK], the school peon, was the only person who was not affected by the spirit of liberty that was abroad, and as soon as the offer to dye his turban reached his ears, he rushed into the crowd with a big stick and dispersed the revellers.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ebenezar	The headmaster grimly asked him to go on. [MASK] had meanwhile stealthily inserted a finger into the pages of the closed Bible. On the word of command from the headmaster, he tried to look sweet and relaxed his brow, which was knit in fury.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Swaminathan	‘Oh, that! The animal has had it since its birth, sir.’ ‘Birth? Are you trying to teach me?’ [MASK] shouted and raised his leg to kick the cart driver. They showed signs of relenting.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Swaminathan	She said that she could not as she was very busy. Why could he himself not go and ask? ‘Oh, he will give more readily if you ask,’ said [MASK]. He went to his father and said: ‘Father, I want to ask you something.’
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Mani	I just showed him the coachman’s son and was about to leave him, just as we had planned, when all of a sudden he tried to murder me. . .’ He shot an angry glance at [MASK].
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Swaminathan	‘And yet you are wandering about the house like an unleashed donkey! What preposterous list is this? Do you think rupees, annas and paise drop from the sky?’ [MASK] did not think so, but something nearly so.
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Swaminathan	[MASK] fell into a pleasant state of mind. The very fact that he was-allowed to be present there and watch the play gave him a sense of importance. He would have something to say to his friends tomorrow. He slowly moved and stood near the screen behind his father.
<name>Roger</name>	Roger	Swaminathan	At five o’clock when he was ready to start for the club, [MASK]’s father felt sorry for having worried his son all the afternoon. ‘Would you like to come with me to the club, boy?’
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Rajam	To [MASK] it was a terrible moment. To be outdone by his servant before his friends! He sat still for a few minutes and then said with a forced laugh: ‘The scoundrel, that cook is a buffoon. . .Wait a minute.’
<name>Swaminathan</name>	Swaminathan	Swaminathan	[MASK] had at first thought of complaining of headache, but now he saw that the drill master was in a mood to slight even the most serious of headaches. He had an inspiration and said: ‘Sir, the whole of last night I was delirious.’
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Swaminathan	It may be that I know one or two questions. But don’t let the other fellows know anything about it. I may get into trouble.’ [MASK] was taken in by the other’s seriousness and inferred a moral.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sankar	‘I am glad to hear it, but does it apply to anyone here?’ asked [MASK]. ‘It may.’ ‘What is a tail?’ ‘A long thing that attaches itself to an ass or a dog.’
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Ranga	[MASK], exasperated by its conduct, got down to let the animal know and feel what he thought of it. In the dim morning light, he saw a human form across the way. He shouted. ‘Hi! Get up, lazy lubber.
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Swaminathan	‘There was only a gold bangle. How much have you written for the question?’ ‘One page,’ said the class-mate. [MASK] did not like this answer. He had written only a line. ‘What! You should not have written so much.’
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Rajam	He looked around, his face twitching with shame and rage. He saw the Pea sitting in a corner, his eyes twinkling with mischief, and felt impelled to take him by the throat. He turned round and saw [MASK] regarding him steadily, his mouth still quivering with a smothered grin.
<name>Ronny</name>	Ronny	Swaminathan	This retrospect was spoiled by one memory. He had forgotten to take leave of the Forest Officer, though that gentleman opened the door of the car and stood near it. [MASK]’s conscience scorched him at the recollection of it.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Swaminathan	[MASK] stood between them and acted as the medium of communication. They were so close that they could have heard each other even if they had spoken in whispers. But it was a matter of form between enemies to communicate through a medium.
<name>him</name>	him	Swaminathan	The noise that they made, sitting on their benches and swinging their legs, got on his nerves. He wrinkled his brow and twisted his mouth in the hope of making the teacher feel his resentment; but unfortunately the teacher was sitting with his back to [MASK].
<name>Govind</name>	Govind	Swaminathan	[MASK] seemed to be an expert in thinking out difficulties. He said, ‘Even if we want to pay, whom are we to pay the taxes to?’ Certainly not to His Majesty or the Viceroy. Who was the Government?
<name>Sanmao</name>	Sanmao	Rajam	He asked again, ‘To what class do you fellows belong? Have you no class?’ ‘I don’t belong to your school,’ [MASK] said defiantly. ‘Ah, then which heaven do you drop from?’
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Swaminathan	[MASK] gazed and gazed at this sum, and every time he read it, it seemed to acquire a new meaning. He had the feeling of having stepped into a fearful maze. . . His mouth began to water at the thought of mangoes.
<name>Ramesh</name>	Ramesh	Rajam	Two runs. He stood with the bat. The captain of the Y.M.U. bowled, and he hit a sixer. The cheers were deafening. [MASK] ran round the field in joy, jumped up the wall and down thrice. The next ball was bowled.
<name>Suresh</name>	Suresh	Sankar	It is very hot here. I am playing cricket now. I can’t write more. With regards, your dearest friend, [MASK]. p. s. Don’t forget me. S. They were profoundly moved by this letter, and decided to reply at once.
<name>Chike</name>	Chike	Mani	You asked me to mind my business only when I offered to accompany you. I am not accompanying you. I just came this way, and you have also come this way. This is a public road.’ [MASK]’s jest was lost on them.
<name>Swami</name>	Swami	Rajam	The headmaster’s white cane lay on the table across two ink-bottles and some pads. The sun came in a hot dusty beam and fell on the headmaster’s nose and the table. He was gently snoring. This was a possibility that [MASK] had not thought of.
<name>Timmy</name>	Timmy	Swaminathan	You are getting under my feet.’ [MASK] obeyed with a reluctant heart. He kept shooting glances sideways and behind. He stooped and picked up a stone, a sharp stone, and held it ready for use if any emergency should arise.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rajam	‘Sit down, boys, sit down,’ he cried when he saw them standing. In a few minutes they were chatting about odds and ends, discussing their teachers and schoolmates, their parents, toys, and games. [MASK] took them to a cupboard and threw it open.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mani	‘You called me a sneak before someone.’ ‘That is a lie.’ There was an awkward pause. ‘If this is all the cause of your anger, forget it. I won’t mind being friends.’ ‘Nor I,’ said [MASK].
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Swaminathan	His further reflections on the subject and the quiet discussion among the visitors about the possible dangers that might have befallen [MASK], were all disturbed—destroyed, would be more accurate—by a tornado-like personality sweeping into their midst with the tremendous shout, ‘What!
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Mani	Let us become friends.’ The boy had no objection. ‘Won’t you let me see it?’ he asked. [MASK] gave it to him. The boy turned it in his hand twice or thrice and in the twinkling of an eye disappeared from the place.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Swaminathan	I can’t attend drill today. I shall die if I do. Sir, I think I shall—’ He was prancing behind the drill master. The drill master had come to the last boy and yet [MASK] was dogging him.
<name>Ratan</name>	Ratan	Mani	‘Yes. That boy who is very strong but never passes his examination.’ ‘No. No. That is [MASK].’ ‘Oh, now I remember, it is a boy who is called the Gramme or something, that witty little boy.’
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	The teacher was intolerable today. [MASK]’s blood boiled. He got up and asked, ‘If he did not, why was he crucified?’ The teacher told him that he might come to him at the end of the period and learn it in private.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Swaminathan	This was an immense sum, which [MASK] hoped to possess in some distant future when he should become as tall as his father. He said so. At which the coachman gave a convincing talk on how to get it.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Rajam	Somebody was wielding the bat rather languidly, bowled and fielded by a handful who were equally languid—the languor that comes at the end of a strenuous evening in the sun. In addition to the misery of disappointment, you found [MASK] a bit sore.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Mani	‘Is that so? Find out from your father what he was doing on the day a gang of little rascals came in and smashed these windows. . . What is the thing that fellow has in his hand?’ ‘My wooden club,’ [MASK] answered.
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Rajam	When it had come within a yard of the culvert, they rose, advanced, stood in a row, and shouted: ‘Pull up the animal, will you?’ The cart driver was a little village boy. ‘Stop the cart, you fool,’ cried [MASK].
<name>Ramanujan</name>	Ramanujan	Mani	May hardly get thirty-five.’ ‘You rascal, you are lying. If you get a first class, may I cut off your tuft?’ [MASK] asked. The bell rang again fifteen minutes later. The whole school crowded into the hall.
<name>Bhola</name>	Bhola	Swaminathan	‘I may say a thousand things,’ [MASK] answered brusquely, ‘but isn’t a three-paisa coin sufficient? You can buy an almond peppermint if you want.’ ‘But you said two almond peppermints.’ ‘Now be off, young man.
<name>Ratna</name>	Ratna	Rajam	[MASK] suggested. ‘I have tried it. But whenever he comes out, he is on his coach. And as soon as he sees me, he takes out his long whip. I get out of his reach and shout. But what is the use?
<name>Ramu</name>	Ramu	Swaminathan	[MASK] suddenly realized that it would be better to approach his father at some other time. He could be sure of a better reception if he opened the question after food. He tiptoed out. When he was just outside the door, his father called out, ‘Who is that?’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Swaminathan	‘I am afraid to ask that monster,’ [MASK] said. ‘He may detain me in Second Form for ages.’ ‘Indeed! Are you telling me that you are in such terror of your headmaster? Suppose I see him?’
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Rajam	There were chairs in it, actually chairs, and a good big table with [MASK]’s books arranged neatly on it. What impressed them most was a timepiece on the table. Such a young fellow to own a timepiece! His father seemed to be an extraordinary man.
<name>Philip</name>	Philip	Swaminathan	He is a gem. But it is difficult to get on with him.’ With a forced optimism in his tone [MASK] said, ‘He will be all right when he sees me. I shall see him tomorrow morning.’
<name>Gregor</name>	Gregor	Swaminathan	[MASK] again explained to him how important it was for him to have his evenings free. But the doctor said: ‘It is all very well. But I should be prosecuted if I gave you any such certificate.’ ‘Who is going to find it out, doctor?
<name>Ravi</name>	Ravi	Swaminathan	‘Wait a minute then,’ said [MASK] and ran out. He had one last hope that his granny might be asleep. It was infinitely safer to show one’s friends a sleeping granny. He saw her sitting on her bed complacently. He was disappointed.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Swaminathan	[MASK], though he was considered to be a bit of a heretic, caught the enthusiasm and perched on the other arm of the chair. All the three devoured with their eyes the glossy pictures of cricket balls, bats, and nets.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Swaminathan	I have half a mind to thrash you. What have you in your head? Ten mangoes cost fifteen annas. What is the price of one? Come on. If you don’t say it—’ His hand took [MASK]’s ear and gently twisted it.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Swaminathan	His father stood behind him, with the baby in his arms. He asked, ‘What are you lecturing about, young man?’ [MASK] had not noticed his father’s presence, and now writhed awkwardly as he answered, ‘Nothing. . .
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Swami	[MASK]. . .’ the voice said, and then the dreadful suggestion of a sacrifice. It was some devil, coming behind him noiselessly, and saying the same thing over and over again, deep into his ears. He stopped and looked about.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rajam	He wanted to pick out something that could be presented to [MASK] on the following morning. The contents of the box were a confused heap of odds and ends of all metals and materials. Here a cardboard box that had once
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Swaminathan	The very small man could hardly believe his ears. Here was a man actually offering almond peppermints! It could not be true. There was probably some fraud in it. [MASK] repeated the offer and the small man replied rather cautiously that he would like to have the peppermint.
<name>Life</name>	Life	Ebenezar	When the scripture period arrived there was a general expectation of some dramatic denouement. But nothing happened. [MASK] went on as merrily as ever. He had taken the trouble that day to plod through Bhagavadgita, and this generous piece of writing lends itself to any interpretation.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Granny	Do you know how many marks he gets in arithmetic?’ ‘He gets all the marks, does he, child?’ asked [MASK]. ‘No, silly. He gets ninety marks out of one hundred.’ ‘Good.
<name>Ram</name>	Ram	Swaminathan	In sheer despair he opened his heart to a coachman—a casual acquaintance of his. The coachman was very sympathetic. He agreed that existence was difficult without a hoop. He said that he would be able to give [MASK] one in a few hours if the latter could give him five rupees.
<name>River</name>	River	Sarayu	Its sandbanks were the evening resort of all the people of the town. The Municipal President took any distinguished visitor to the top of the town hall and proudly pointed to him [MASK] in moonlight, glistening like a silver belt across the north. The usual evening crowd was on the sand.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Swaminathan	The child may cry till he has fits, for aught she cares. . 9 School breaks up With dry lips, parched throat, and ink-stained fingers, and exhaustion on one side and exaltation on the other, [MASK] strode out of the examination hall on the last day.
<name>David</name>	David	Swaminathan	Only they—the policemen—looked like monkeys, and they behaved like monkeys too. The headmaster entered the class with a slightly flushed face and a hard ominous look in his eyes. [MASK] wished that he had been anywhere but there at that moment.
