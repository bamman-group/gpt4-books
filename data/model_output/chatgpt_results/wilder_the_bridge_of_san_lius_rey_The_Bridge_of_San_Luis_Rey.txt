<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Manuel	I tell you I’m glad things are as they are. Look, I got to get angry when you keep going back to that.” "[MASK], I wouldn’t speak of it again, only when you get angry at me about the cloths . . .
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Esteban	"What’s the matter?" he asked. "I’m going out for a walk," replied [MASK] sombrely, fastening his belt. After a moment, he broke out with an assumption of anger: "You don’t have to say . . .
<name>the boy</name>	the boy	Esteban	The next morning he was waiting at the bottom of the stairs when [MASK] appeared: "We’re starting when you’re ready,” said the Captain. The strange glitter had returned to the boy’s eyes. He blurted out: "No, I’m not coming.
<name>Angelica</name>	Angelica	Pepita	She leaned her forehead upon her hand, following the long tender curve that the soprano lifts in the Kyrie. “My affection should have had more of that colour, [MASK]. My whole life should have had more of that quality.
<name>Lily Bart</name>	Lily Bart	Camila	They looked like figures that had strayed there from some remote country, or out of an old ballad, that had not yet learned the new language and had not yet found any friends. [MASK] was about thirty when she left the stage and it required five years for her to achieve her place in society.
<name>Nur Jahan</name>	Nur Jahan	Camila	He held his breath for years. [MASK] bore the Viceroy three children, yet remained the same. He knew that the first sign of her entrance into the true possession of the world would be the mastery of certain effects in her acting.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Esteban	The Captain gave no sign of recognizing or even of seeing him until he had finished his meal. [MASK] had finished long before, but not wishing to be spoken to, waited until the Captain should have left the cave.
<name>Florence</name>	Florence	Pepita	She was the nurse who tends the sick who never recover; she was the priest who perpetually renews the office before an altar to which no worshippers come. There would be no [MASK] to enlarge her work; it would relapse into the indolence and the indifference of her colleagues.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Pepita	But, senora, you are good enough to forgive my leaving early, yes, even in the middle of your admirable performance. I forget why we left. [MASK] . . . oh, some indisposition. . . .”
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Manuel	Heaven protect you, my colt. Friday night, the same place, the same time. I may be a little late, for the fox is wideawake. That will be all.” [MASK] rose. "You swear that you have made no errors?”
<name>Mrs. Robinson</name>	Mrs. Robinson	Camila	He set her endless exercises in acting and mimicry; he set her problems in conveying the atmosphere of a song; he took her to the theatres and made her notice all the details of a performance. But it was from [MASK] as a woman that he was to receive his greatest shock.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Pepita	I no longer claim the least influence. What will be, will be.” She sat for a long time, her palms against her cheeks, making a blank of her mind. Her eyes fell on [MASK]’s letter. She opened it mechanically and started to read.
<name>John</name>	John	Pepita	And now from this strange inn in these strange mountains, where the altitude was making her lightheaded, [MASK] longed for the dear presence, the only real thing in her life. She wrote a letter, all inkstains and incoherence.
<name>Abbeville</name>	Abbeville	Camilas	"Nothing, little pearl. My little Camila of [MASK], nothing.” "There was something you didn’t like. Ugly fault-finding thing that you are. Come on now, what was it? Look, I’m ready.”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Esteban	When the fearful procession passed through the city, with its black hoods and masks, its candles in broad daylight, its display of heaped-up skulls, its terrifying psalms, [MASK] followed it in the parallel streets, catching glimpses of it from a distance, like a savage.
<name>Tuppence</name>	Tuppence	Manuel	There was a light tap at the door and [MASK] opened to admit a lady heavily veiled, out of breath and nervous. She threw back the scarf from her face and said hurriedly: "Quick, ink and paper.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Camila	But even then [MASK], convinced in her pride that he pitied her, lashed him with the blade of her tongue and derived some strange comfort from heaping him with sneers. He loved her the more, understanding better than she did herself all the stages in the conva-
<name>Meg</name>	Meg	Pepita	It would make her very happy. I know.” [MASK] was reddening. She said loudly: "The innkeeper said that there would be some new charcoal ready for you at dark. I’ll tell them to bring it up now.”
<name>Lord Henry</name>	Lord Henry	Pepita	At last she was able to murmur: "It was in the songs between the acts of the comedy. I was afraid Your Grace . . "Yes, yes. I remember now. I left early. [MASK], we left early, did we not?
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Esteban	Don’t stay here. You’ll be happy. There’s room for us all in the world.” Then the realization became even more intense and he received a mental image of [MASK] going a long way off and saying good-bye many times as he went.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Pepita	But after a moment she suddenly felt the need to reread the whole letter, to surprise, if possible, the secret of so much felicity. [MASK] returned bringing the supper in her hands, fol- lowed by a maid.
<name>he</name>	he	Vicente	1 shall therefore ask your permission to write you at less length then usual. If [MASK] returns before the post leaves he will be delighted to finish out the leaf and supply you with those tiresome details about myself which you seem to enjoy so.
<name>she</name>	she	Esteban	She could just come and see you for a few minutes, I mean. . . .” "Her? You still thinking about her? I wouldn’t have her here for anything. No.” But [MASK] was not content yet.
<name>Thérèse</name>	Thérèse	Camila	[MASK] rose and swayed. There! again that access of pain, the hands of the dead she could not reach. Her lips were white. Her head brushed the Abbess's knee: "Mother, what shall I do? I am all alone.
<name>the Captain</name>	the Captain	Esteban	So now when the great traveller came into the dark kitchen where [MASK] was eating the boy drew his chair farther into the shadow, but at a distance, he was glad. The Captain gave no sign of recognizing or even of seeing him until he had finished his meal.
<name>Caruso</name>	Caruso	Pepita	that everything. . . .” "How can I be offended, senora? All that I can remember is that you gave a beautiful performance. You are a great artist. You should be happy, happy. My handkerchief, [MASK]. . . .”
<name>friend</name>	friend	Esteban	He could not be sure the figure on the floor was listening, but he said, ''We do what we can. We push on, [MASK], as best we can. It isn’t for long, you know. Time keeps going by.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Esteban	[MASK] went slowly upstairs. The Captain waited for him and waited so long that presently he ventured half the way up the stairs and listened. At first there was silence; then a series of noises that his imagination was able to identify at once.
<name>Genevieve</name>	Genevieve	Pepita	The education for greatness is difficult enough at any time, but amid the sensibilities and jealousies of a convent it must be conducted with fantastic indirection. [MASK] was assigned to the most disliked tasks in the House, but she came to understand all the aspects of its administration.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Camila	Her personality became so electric that if she so much as laid her hand upon that of a fellow actor a sympathetic shudder ran through the audience. But such occasions of excellence became less and less frequent. As her technique became sounder, [MASK]’s sincerity became less necessary.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Esteban	It’ll be good for you, sure, to not get it all stirred up just this once.” "No, I’ve got to get well. The doctor said it had to be done. I won’t say a word, [MASK].”
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Camila	"You don’t like my new friends, then?” she answered quickly. "Whom do you offer me in their stead?” "[MASK], I only remember . . "I will not be criticized. I don’t want any advice.
<name>Dona Clara</name>	Dona Clara	Senora	Perhaps I should tell you that I saw it made one day by my daughter. My daughter is a very beautiful woman . . . everyone thinks. Did . . . did you know my Dona Clara, [MASK]?” "Her Grace often did me the honour of visiting my theatre.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Manuel	"When did [MASK] die?” "Oh, just a . . . just a few weeks. He hit his knee against something and . . . just a few weeks ago.” They both kept their eyes on the floor.
<name>Ichabod</name>	Ichabod	Esteban	[MASK] ran through the streets to fetch him. He pounded on the door. Presently a woman leaned out of a window and announced that her husband would be back in the morning. During the fearful hours that followed, they told one another that when the doctor had seen the leg all would be well.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Camila	Look, I’m ready.” "No, little fish. Adorable morning star, I suppose you did as well as you could.” The suggestion that she was a limited artist and that certain felicities would be forever closed to her never failed to make [MASK] frantic.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Manuel	He seemed to hear a voice that proceeded from the shadows saying: "Go and follow her, [MASK]. Don’t stay here. You’ll be happy. There’s room for us all in the world.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Manuel	Put it back. There. Now I’m ready.” "Look, [MASK], it won’t hurt if I skip just this once, see. It’ll be good for you, sure, to not get it all stirred up just this once.”
<name>the Shadow</name>	the Shadow	Esteban	The men in the wineshops, alluding to it, shook their heads and smoked in silence for a while. Travellers from the interior told of seeing [MASK] as he strayed with eyes like coals along the dried-up beds of rivers or through the great ruins of the old race.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Pepita	She did not even alight at the inn, but leaving [MASK] to arrange for their stay she went on to the church and knelt for a long time patting her hands softly together. She was listening to the new tide of resignation that was rising within her.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Esteban	At last the Captain raised his voice, as to a deaf person: "I said: Do you want to go on my next trip with me. ...” "Yes, I’ll go,” answered [MASK] suddenly. "Fine. That’s fine.
<name>Phineas</name>	Phineas	Jaime	Her heart was filled with consternation and amazement. Here was another comment from the skies; that was the third time she had been spoken to. Her small-pox, [MASK]’s illness, and now the fall of the bridge,—oh, these were not accidents.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Esteban	Don’t come in now.” [MASK] fell face downward upon the floor. "I am alone, alone, alone,” he cried. The Captain stood above him, his great plain face ridged and gray with pain; it was his own old hours he was reliving.
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Camila	"If her face tells me that she would not despise me, I will speak to her,” she said. [MASK] lurked about the convent church and fell humbly in love with the homely old face, though it frightened her a little. At last she called upon her.
<name>Sibyl</name>	Sibyl	Camila	Let people read the old plays in books if they choose to. It is not worth while fighting with the crowd.” U9 "Wonderful [MASK], I was not just to you when you were on the stage. It was some foolish pride in me.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Pepita	If you have one you can enclose it with mine.” "No, I have none,” said [MASK]. She added hastily: "I must go downstairs and get you the new charcoal.” "But, my dear, you have one for . . .
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Manuel	"[MASK].” "It doesn’t matter. You are both unfriendly. Neither of you ever comes to see me. Here I sit learning stupid lines all day and no one ever comes to see me but a lot of peddlers.
<name>Marquesa</name>	Marquesa	Camila	oh, some indisposition. . . .” It was impossible that anyone in the theatre could have missed the intention of the songs. [MASK] could only assume that the Marquesa, out of a sort of fantastic magnanimity, was playing the farce of not having noticed it.
<name>Madame de la Vega</name>	Madame de la Vega	Camila	For [MASK] the half-closed eyes had the air of weary authority and she began almost timidly: "I come, senora, to make sure that you could not have misunderstood anything I said on the evening that Your Grace did me the honour to visit my theatre.”
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Manuel	There was no room in his imagination for a new loyalty, not because his heart was less large than [MASK]’s, but because it was of a simpler texture. Now he discovered that secret from which one never quite recovers, that even in the most perfect love one person loves less profoundly than the other.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Esteban	But while they continued staring into one another’s face waiting for the miracle of science the pain grew worse. Hour after hour [MASK] approached with his dripping towel and they discovered that the moment of its application was the worst of all.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Esteban	[MASK] had scraped away the plaster about a beam and was adjusting a rope about it. The Captain stood on the stairs trembling: "Perhaps it’s best,’’ he said to himself. "Perhaps I should leave him alone. Perhaps it’s the only thing possible for him.”
<name>The actress</name>	The actress	Camila	She put them on and tottered into her handsomest reception room where the actress stood waiting for her. [MASK] had intended to be perfunctory and if possible impudent, but now she was struck for the first time with the dignity of the old woman.
<name>the patient</name>	the patient	Manuel	During the fearful hours that followed, they told one another that when the doctor had seen the leg all would be well. He would do something about it, and [MASK] would be out around the town in a day or two, even in a day perhaps, even less than a day.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Esteban	but he could understand [MASK]’s misery, as misery. And at once he sacrificed everything to it, if it can be said we ever sacrifice anything save what we know we can never attain, or what some secret wisdom tells us it would be uncomfortable or saddening to possess.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Manuel	[MASK] turned from the door with his candle. He sat down, put his hands over his ears, his elbows on his knees. He worshipped her. He murmured to himself over and over again that he worshipped her, making of the sound a sort of incantation and an obstacle to thought.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Camila	I don’t want to speak to a soul. My life is over. That is all.” "[MASK], by our long life together, I beg of you to grant me one thing. I shall go away and never trouble you again.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Esteban	I got to go in the city and see somebody about something.” "Well, [MASK]. Come back here for supper and we’ll talk about the trip. Come back and have some wine with me, see. Will you?” "Yes, I will.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Esteban	The present isn’t from me only. She was . . . was . . .” Here [MASK] wished to say his brother’s name, but was unable to. Instead he continued in a lower voice: "She had a kind of a . . .
<name>my dear</name>	my dear	Manuel	But now I can see that you don’t like me and that to ask you to write a letter would be as good as reading it aloud in all the wine-shops. What does that look mean, [MASK]? Are you my friend?”
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Esteban	He gazed back at her with the same glance of longing and distrust that he had shown her before, and stood trembling. Again she whispered "My friend” and moved a step forward. Suddenly [MASK] turned and breaking into a run disappeared.
<name>The Duchess</name>	The Duchess	Senora	She was almost in tears: "But you are so good to overlook my childishness, senora,—I mean Your Grace. I did not know. I did not know your goodness. [MASK], permit me to kiss your hand."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Camila	A wild hope ran about the town that the beauty would be impaired that had enabled her to despise the class from which she sprang. The news escaped from the sick-room that [MASK] had become ludicrous in homeliness and the cup of the envious overflowed.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Pepita	And surely enough, before noon I saw him hurry by on one of those mysterious errands of his. As I am the idlest and silliest of ivomen I sent [MASK] to get me a piece of nougat which I placed on the ant’s highway.
<name>she</name>	she	Esteban	Make it plain. That’s the last I have to do with her,” and with that he began reciting his evening psalm aloud. But he had hardly reached A sagitta volante in die when he became aware that [MASK] had risen and was lighting the candle.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Manuel	It was not the first time that [MASK] had been fascinated by a woman (both brothers had possessed women, and often, especially during their years at the waterfront; but simply, latinly), but it was the first time that his will and imagination had been thus overwhelmed.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Esteban	[MASK] was instructed to lay cold cloths on his brother's leg every hour. The barber withdrew and the brothers sat down to wait for the pain to subside. But while they continued staring into one another’s face waiting for the miracle of science the pain grew worse.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Pepita	During the week that preceded the making of the packet she observed a strict regimen and cultivated the city assiduously for material. At last on the eve of the post she wrote the letter, making up the bundle towards dawn and leaving it for [MASK] to deliver to the agent.
<name>Perichole</name>	Perichole	Esteban	But he did understand that [MASK] was suffering. In his excitement he groped for a means of holding this brother who seemed to be receding into the distance. And at once, in one unhesitating stroke of the will, he removed the Perichole from his heart.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Esteban	[MASK], holding his candle, would go into the hall and permit them to rage at him for as long as they pleased; but after that he took to pressing his hand firmly over his brother’s mouth during the moments of greatest stress.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Esteban	You know,” cried [MASK], leaning across the table, "you’re not allowed to kill yourself; you know you're not allowed. Everybody knows that. But if you jump into a burning house to save somebody, that wouldn’t be killing yourself.
<name>Flora</name>	Flora	Esteban	"Go away. Send me [MASK]. You do not even say Yes, senora as a friend would saiy it.” Long pause. Presently she raised her head: "Are you still there, Unfriendly?” "Yes, senora . . .
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Camila	[MASK] continued walking about the room for several minutes, consumed by her thoughts. Presently without so much as glancing at her secretary, she commanded: "Take another leaf. Have you gone mad? Do not ever think of dedicating another bull to me again.
<name>El Puente de los Suspiros</name>	El Puente de los Suspiros	Tuesday	A new bridge of stone has been built in the place of the old, but the event has not been forgotten. It has passed into proverbial expressions. "I may see you [MASK],” says a Limean, "unless the bridge falls.”
<name>might</name>	might	Manuel	When I was ill you made the cook let you bring me my soup?” Another woman would have said: "Do you remember how much I did for you?” "Yes.” "I, too, [MASK] have lost. I too . . .
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Esteban	You see it’s the ocean you want. Besides on the boat you’ll have something to do every minute. I’ll see to that. Go and get your things and we’ll start.” [MASK] was trying to make a decision.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Esteban	It was some time before [MASK] was able to realize that his brother’s mind was not then clear. After some moments of horror, in which his being a devout believer had its part, he would return to the room and go about his duties with bent head.
<name>Eu</name>	Eu	Manuel	You are [MASK], yes? You must do a letter for me at once.” For a moment her glance fell on the two bright eyes that glared at her from the edge of the cot. She murmured: "Eu . . . you must excuse me.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Jenarito	"Do not remain so, on one knee, my child.—Pepita, tell [MASK] to bring this lady some sweetcakes at once. Think, one day we fell out, I forget over what. Oh, there is nothing strange in that; all we mothers from time to time. . . .
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Esteban	I want your brother, too, of course.” "No.” "What’s the matter? Wouldn’t he want to come?” [MASK] mumbled something, looking away. Then half rising, he said: "I got to go now.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Pepita	[MASK] tiptoed about the room laying the table and whispering directions to her assistant. "Your supper is ready, My Lady,” she said at last. "But, my child, you are going to eat with me?”
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Pepita	She had not for a long time been addressed with such consideration. Her neighbors, her tradespeople, her servants—for even [MASK] lived in awe of her,—her very daughter had never approached her thus. It induced a new mood in her; one that must very likely be called maudlin.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Esteban	It won’t do you any harm, I’ll just skip this time.” "I’ve got to get well, [MASK]. I’ve got to get up soon, you know. Put them on. But one minute—give me the crucifix.
<name>death</name>	death	Monreale	She was well loved by her people and all their prayers and embroideries were sincere, but ineffectual. Now she lies in the splendor of [MASK], and a few inches above her heart may be read the words: I shall fear no evil."
<name>Helen</name>	Helen	Camila	He was also her singing-master, her coiffeur, her masseur, her reader, her errand-boy, her banker; rumor added: her father. For example, he taught her her parts. There was a whisper around town that [MASK] could read and write.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Esteban	"Even from [MASK].” "Well, that’s better.” She motioned him to sit down at a table where writing materials were already laid out. As she dictated she strode about the room, frowning, swinging her hips.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Esteban	I only did for a time.” By now [MASK] stood in the dark of the open door. In the unnatural voice with which we make the greatest declarations of our lives, he muttered: "I’m in your way,” and turned to go.
<name>The Captain</name>	The Captain	Esteban	I don’t know who it was, and I want to give her a present. Women can’t bear that kind of a thing like we can.” The Captain promised him that they would choose something in the morning. [MASK] talked about it at great length.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Esteban	I’ve got to see somebody about something.” "Let me see your brother myself. Where is he?” ". . . ’dead.” said [MASK]. "Oh, I didn’t know. I didn’t know. I’m sorry.”
<name>Billy Bones</name>	Billy Bones	Esteban	The Captain got him very drunk. At first they poured and drank and poured and drank in silence. Then the Captain began to talk about ships and their courses. He asked [MASK] questions about tackle and about the guide-stars.
<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Esteban	He murmured to himself over and over again that he worshipped her, making of the sound a sort of incantation and an obstacle to thought. He emptied his mind of everything but a singsong, and it was this vacancy that permitted him to become aware of [MASK]’s mood.
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Camila	The public for which masterpieces are intended is not on this earth. With the passing of time [MASK] lost some of this absorption in her art. A certain intermittent contempt for acting made her negligent. It was due to the poverty of interest in women’s roles throughout Spanish classical drama.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Manuel	Don’t think about it twice. It’s time to put them on now. I won’t say a word.” "No, [MASK], I’ll skip this time. It won’t do you any harm, I’ll just skip this time.”
<name>John</name>	John	Esteban	He would resort to guile and declare that he scarcely felt it. But [MASK], his heart bursting with pain and his lips a line of iron, would roll back the blanket and bind the towel fiercely in its place.
<name>He</name>	He	Esteban	"I won’t. I’m going out for a walk,” replied [MASK] picking up his coat. "You can’t go out for a walk. It’s two o’clock. It’s raining. You can’t go and walk about for hours like that.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Pepita	Then she took a candle into the next room and looked at [MASK] as she slept, and pushed back the damp hair from the girl’s face. "Let me live now,” she whispered. "Let me begin again.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Esteban	She’s nothing to me. When are you going to forget that, [MASK]? I tell you I’m glad things are as they are. Look, I got to get angry when you keep going back to that.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Jaime	Her eyes were resting on the star that seemed to be leading forth the whole sky in its wonder. A great pain lay at her heart, the pain of a world that was meaningless. Then she said: "If [MASK] wishes to go with you, very well.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Camila	[MASK] stood still, confounded. To herself she said: "Life is too fearful to bear. When may I die?” After a moment she answered him, in a hoarse voice: "I have very little money. I will pay you what I can.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Esteban	Do you suppose she’d give me those letters to write if there were any chance? Do you suppose she’d push a piece of money across the table every time. . . . You’re crazy, [MASK], that’s all.” There was a long pause.
