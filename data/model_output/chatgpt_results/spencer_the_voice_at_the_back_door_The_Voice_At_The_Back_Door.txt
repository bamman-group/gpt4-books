<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Cissy	[MASK] was nineteen, and poised that summer at a moment of femininity so intense that her virginity seemed scandalously out of order in the universe. The flesh of her arm was soft as freshly molded butter; even the redolence of the bathroom when she left it held something all lazily like a sigh.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Harper	“What class does that put me in?” “The blue class, probably. Say, [MASK], you know you kept deviling me up at the hospital to tell you who it was shot me? Well, I’ve thought it over.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Tinker	“[MASK], I-” She glanced up. The wooden spoon continued to move rapidly. She was the instant before turning the dough out to knead. “People have been calling you all afternoon. If you look on the phone table.” He lied automatically.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Sam	It might have been about the weather, how hot it was. “You seen [MASK]?” the older man asked the young one. He picked his teeth with a match stub and watched the other lift an oyster till it severed from the shell.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Duncan	“No, you wouldn’t,” [MASK] said. Now all the cars had gone away but theirs. They were left with the old square. The two streetlights bleared in the wet. The last car, disappearing, jolted in a rut by the filling station.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Sam	“It’s still my place, goddam it, you haven’t moved your wheels and tables up there yet. I got my reasons and I stick to them.” “The thing we came to say is, we may not move the wheels and tables up there at all. So [MASK] says.”
<name>William</name>	William	Everett	She pressed up the skin of his brow and watched the long horizontal lines disappear, and then as her hand relaxed saw their inevitable return. “Before he died,” she went on finally, “[MASK] thought there were soldiers out by the summerhouse.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Duncan	The little girl began to sneeze. “I guess that’s my fault too,” said [MASK]. “No, it’s my fault. I took her down with me to weed the terrace, and the brick is still damp.” She turned away from the sink.
<name>She</name>	She	Kerney	I know this much: I just have to go along with it the way it’s always looked to me. I have to follow it through the way I started it. I can’t care too much any more what they want.” “[MASK] cares.
<name>George</name>	George	Jimmy	I’ve loved you all my life, for instance. You think I ever have to tell you or anybody else?” “Oh, [MASK].” She began to cry a little and he sat down by her to comfort her, holding her against his shoulder.
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Tinker	It had also become suddenly hot. Down on the terrace just back of the house, [MASK] found that grass had forced up overnight between the bricks. She went down on Sunday afternoons with her trowel and scissors, working on her knees until the sun lowered.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Kerney	I’ve seen enough of you around the house for quite a while to get to feel like you’re one of the family. With a little urging I might have called myself talking to a son of my own.” Whatever [MASK] felt about this did not reveal itself in his face.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Follansbee	In the other he held a pair of expensive tan leather gloves. “You know,” [MASK] went on seriously, “there’s a bare space that long between the top of their stockings and the bottom of their pants.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jimmy	Its plushy wheels pressed the gravel tenderly, and its motor purred like a kitten. Three men got out and went with [MASK] into the cafe. They sat down at a table covered with a red checkered cloth which matched the curtains in the windows.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Kerney	His thinking went on lonely, like going down an empty valley in a strange country, while [MASK], with his hat in hand and his Lincoln-like stoop for catching every word, remained talking, nodding, listening gravely, shaking hand after hand.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Cissy	“About what?” asked [MASK]. Later she followed him out to the car where it sat under the cedars in the drive. They sat in the car and had a cigarette and she let him kiss her a few times.
<name>the politician</name>	the politician	Kerney	“After I heard what you said, and had seen what I saw, I checked to see if my poll tax was paid up and sure enough it was. So I voted for you.” “A good thing to do,” said [MASK], falling into his automatic politician’s street banter.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Kerney	A wrist watch. When I found out it was meant for a bribe, I gave it back.” “I’m sure you did.” “[MASK], there’s no use getting worked up over this.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Beck	There ain’t no dealing with white folks, this one or the next one. I reckon [MASK] know hit now. Turn aloose of me and hush, W.B. I ain’t got time for you to be no baby. You gots to be a man.”
<name>Corrigan</name>	Corrigan	Mitchell	I was mighty glad to hear it. Glad! I was downright thankful.” “It squares with what [MASK] says,” said the detective, “almost word for word.” He dusted the cracker crumbs from his mouth and polished off his beer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cissy-	He turned to her, one arm staying upon the wheel just where it had deflected the car into the lane, while the other extended along the back of the seat. He reached out his hand gently. “[MASK]?” She drew back from his touching her at all.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Doc	Before we can?” “I don’t know.” He loosened a hangnail with his thumb. “[MASK] says a year or two.” “A year!” Her mouth seemed to have fallen permanently open. “How’s the preacher?”
<name>JFK</name>	JFK	Tallant	“I think I know who shot [MASK], and I think I can prove it before the Saturday speaking.” “You what? But who—?” “I can tell you what it is, but not where I got it from.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Follansbee	When did you shave last?” [MASK] touched his chin. It was not really a chin, only a gable on his neck. “This morning,” he said. “I shave every morning. It just grows so fast, that’s all.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Sam	You believe in himotism? Maybe he himotized me.” “Where you going to be?” “Right here.” “Not going to hunt up [MASK]?” “That bastard better stay away from me. Him and his talk about the ‘code.’
<name>he</name>	he	Tallant	“You can’t go by what [MASK] says,” said the tall man. “He’d just as soon lie to you as look at you. Ask him what time it is, he’ll look at his watch and tell you thirty minutes off, just to see what you’ll do.
<name>George</name>	George	Duncan	“Of course there’s room,” she said. “Well I’ll be goddamned,” said the tall man to the other. “Do you see that?” Before [MASK] could start the motor, they stood beside him, their faces thrusting in the window.
<name>logs</name>	logs	Granthams	Nobody left. They all sat waiting after the load of [MASK] had screamed away through the rain: you could hear the gears mesh a half mile away on the long drag running outward toward the highway. Still they waited.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Tinker	[MASK] asked. “He hates the thought of losing. But you can’t tell. He may make them see the truth. How can you ever know how deep a fake nigger-issue goes? We don’t even know for sure how deep a real one goes any more.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Duncan	“You know you oughtn’t to be up. It’s nothing serious or I would’ve told you.” She hung in the door, mouth open, wrapper drooping about her shoulders, eyebrows mismatched, and in all her pregnancy so honestly uncomfortable that [MASK] felt sorry for her.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tinker	Can you think of their names?” He crossed toward her, and at his approach she flinched and ran backward from him. It was when she released her hold on the spoon and pan that she seemed to turn wild. “[MASK]! Darling, listen—!”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Duncan	[MASK] had not noticed her before and he started, turning, and saw her emerging from the dark bundle on the back seat which he had not even taken for a person. She was shaking back the clumsy raincoat hood from her bright hair.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Jason	“That’s right.” “What did she say?” “I said yes. The piece in the paper.” “Certainly I know. I read the paper every day.” “She keeps up,” said [MASK].
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Everett	I trailed every scent like a bloodhound and bayed all night at empty trees. I wanted, passionately, for you to understand. If I could have showed you once why we had to get away, that they were turning our love into a complicated family thing, that they had killed [MASK] and
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Travis	Two Negro girls stood one on either side, fanning her. Her cries had been silenced by hypodermic: word went out that she was “resting easier.” Food had begun to arrive twenty minutes after [MASK] fell; there was enough of it now to last for a month.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Lucy	She rose when she was done and found her bag for a handkerchief. [MASK] had retired, who knew when, or would ever know? She was a Negro, and her tact was of this quality. The room rested deep in twilight.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Duncan	The minute she came back she started after [MASK] again.” He was silent. “Well, whose fault do you think it was? His?” “I don’t think she would have left him if he hadn’t failed her someway.”
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Duncan	“Why is that?” “It’s part of getting old,” said [MASK]. “I take it hard. Harder than most people do.” “I don’t know whether you do or not,” he answered. a path leads backward 22.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Beck	What?” The phone crackled. “I said when do you pay me?” [MASK] asked. “Any time. I don’t care. I got to hang up. . . . Tonight at seven by the old Idle Hour. Okay. Sure.”
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Duncan	“Can I help it if people like to drink? You’ve said yourself time and again, [MASK], you and this prodigy here, that the dry laws in this state are nothing but damn foolishness.” “Sure I have. I’ll say it again, and publicly.
<name>Violet</name>	Violet	Tinker	There was a red glow among the trees, which stood black and wet against the horizon. Every pane in the bay window was drenched in red. [MASK]’s mother hoisted her in through a window and she unlatched the front door.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Jimmy	“Don’t do it again,” [MASK] said. “We don’t like strangers in our yard at night.” For some reason he had not said niggers. But then his mother had brought him up never to say nigger to a nigger’s face.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cissy	She retained a satisfying impression of Tinker too carefully matched in navy and white, even to navy and white pumps. You would wonder perhaps if in her navy bag there was not a white handkerchief with a navy figure. She regained the leather seat of the convertible and surprised [MASK] with the Coca-cola.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jimmy	[MASK] shook his head and passed the whisky on to the third, who was young, just a boy, and who wore his coat very roomy. “I’ll jest wait till I get me a Coca-cola,” said the boy, and grinned.
<name>statue</name>	statue	Harper	There’s always been a [MASK] on the town square. You know yourself I’ve got property around here and there—the grocery isn’t everything. The people I grew up with are all here, and all my father’s friends that are left alive.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Jason	Yet he wished to proceed with caution, for the two were friends and were known as running mates. What had drawn this up? Young political ideals, brave things to say about Negroes? Or love of his two daughters? [MASK] stripped a cigar and pared it in the wastebasket.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Duncan	He scratched his forehead where the mark of the shade showed red across his indoor skin. “You’ll never get a conviction. You going to carry a nigger’s evidence in front of a grand jury?” [MASK] rose.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Cissy	I don’t guess you’d remember me.” “Oh, sure, I remember. Sure I do.” “I hear this is the fair-haired boy over here that’s speaking now. I hear you’re engaged to him, [MASK].”
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Nigger	She tore his shirt to shreds and brought blood out of him, and kept right on till the whip broke, teaching him, the only way she knew how, the things she thought he had to learn. “[MASK]!
<name>Marge</name>	Marge	Beck	“Oh, I rode with him,” [MASK] said. “He was over in that Delta bingo place, just like you guessed.” “Do you know if there’s anything in the Bible about the father of your children being your legal husband?”
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Bud	But if people are saying it, then you ought to know about it, is the way I feel. I honestly do.” “He sho’ don’t lay a finger on that nigger,” said [MASK]. “And won’t let nobody else.”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Cissy	There was no feel of houses near. He reached over himself and stripped the dark glasses from her face. “[MASK], if anyone ever asks you about that telegram, you are going to say you don’t know anything about it.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Jimmy	The two stood silent. “We considered you might at least think of it as a compliment.” “I think you haven’t counted your blessings,” said [MASK]. “If you ask me, you’ve got the perfect candidate and don’t know it.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Liza	He’s come for his lesson. Get on out into the kitchen with your pea-shelling, [MASK]. I’m lying here worthless, but I can teach this boy.” The old man never walked again.
<name>Mr. Sir</name>	Mr. Sir	Duncan	“I’ll tell you something that’s true,” said [MASK]. “When you want to stop acting silly, start doing something. Now think of something you can do.” “All right, I’ve thought of something.” “What is it?”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Honey	“Men like to talk.” “You think it’s all her fault, don’t you?” “Of course it’s her fault. She left him, ran off with that lumberjack.” “[MASK], he wasn’t a lumberjack.”
<name>Chloe</name>	Chloe	Lucy	“I read up on all such as this, son. Your Aunt [MASK] don’t know, and most white folks don’t either, but if you’re going to mess around on the color line you just as well to understand it.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Tinker	Just answering a question about love could not alter this fact. Just saying “Come away” could not change it. It was his strongest and final quality. what [MASK] knew 34. He found his family all together in the kitchen.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Everett	[MASK] believed they had spoken of him. Raging, he turned away. He wished that his father would die, and he called his mother a bitch. As for his sister, he wished for her simply some sort of disappearance, something that would sponge even the memory of her out of his mind.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Beck	“I thought I’d be dead before this time of day,” said [MASK], riding philosophically, his hand holding to the bar that braced the ventilation window, his legs crossed in his best trousers, his shoes shining under the coat of dust.
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Kerney	He may make them see the truth. How can you ever know how deep a fake nigger-issue goes? We don’t even know for sure how deep a real one goes any more. And [MASK]’s a good speaker, which I’m not.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grantham	But I have heard one or two people say it may be that he and [MASK] control not just that big highway place, but pull the strings for a whole dozen others.” “And-?” Their eyes met.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Duncan	“I saw some rocks over yonder a little way. And some chunks of log from an old pigpen.” [MASK] pointed. “Oh, boy! We could build a big dam with those.” “Sure we could.” “Let’s go.”
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Cotton	He scooped out a ditch in the stream’s bed, laid the post there and leveed it in place with dripping handfuls of sand. Then he began to bring heavy damp sand from the bank. Presently the water downstream ceased splashing. [MASK] was standing near him to watch.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Tinker	In the old days they could have gone too, trotting just behind the wagon, or underneath it, for shade. In lots of ways it seemed like a Sunday; in others not so much. [MASK] dressed in her navy that she had not had on since June.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Cissy	You will do that for me, won’t you, [MASK]?” She inspected a chip in her nail polish. She was somewhat out of humor with him, and was getting hungry. She would not look at him. “Okay. I won’t say anything.”
<name>Isabelle</name>	Isabelle	Kerney	The heat and politics together are too much for me.” He came toward her, threading amongst the rocking chairs, but she stepped back from him saying, “[MASK],” and he had to turn the farthest corner of the porch, puzzling, to find her again.
<name>Clyde</name>	Clyde	Robinson	But nobody said they wanted him back because neither they nor anybody else ever really liked [MASK]. The old Senator had loved him, and this love had emancipated him, had made him independent, learned, scornful, superior, and unkind.
<name>Mattie</name>	Mattie	Tinker	She was a slump-shouldered Negress who wrapped her head in a rag and carried her chin low and to one side, angling a sour eye at the world. [MASK] had hired her, being unable to get anyone else, right after their second child was born.
<name>Mrs. Wiggs</name>	Mrs. Wiggs	Lucy	“That’s right.” He rose and reached down three plates from the safe, then the molasses bucket, and went to the back porch to bring the butter in from the icebox. “Don’t you use up all that butter,” [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Duncan	“ ’Swhat I hear too.” “You moving out?” “No. Staying in to help him. [MASK]’s all right. I got nothing against him.” “I got nothing against him either.
<name>Mr. Dolphus Raymond</name>	Mr. Dolphus Raymond	Duncan	Maybe we can figure something out. [MASK]?” “What?” “It’s raining too hard to lynch a nigger. It’s too cold.” “It’s what?” “It’s the wrong time of year, too.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jimmy	“I’ve put aside a little pile. She knows about it.” “Well now,” said [MASK], “I just as well take my hat and go for a little stroll. Give you two a chance to talk some more.”
<name>The dog</name>	The dog	Dogs	Through this scarlet silence the car darted small and flat; then it ripped over a wooden bridge and was instantly swallowed in the trees of a Negro settlement. [MASK] leaped silent out of nowhere at the flying wheels and raced in pack for a way, yelping.
<name>Mr. Tull</name>	Mr. Tull	Hanley	There’s a car out back.” “Oh yeah, I know. [MASK] sent his nigger in the Chewy demonstrator. Somebody told him his new hog-wire fence was broken down back in the bottom. The nigger left the car up here in the shade.”
<name>she</name>	she	Jimmy	They were silent for a moment, knowing in common with all Southerners that when the knot got too tangled it was just as well left alone. It was just as well to tell a story. “I was with him the night it happened,” [MASK] said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bud	About another half mile you have to ford a branch. After that it’s only two more miles to where [MASK]’s gone to.” “He couldn’t have got back there in this rain. Nobody could.” “His brother came for him.
<name>him</name>	him	Tallant	Her fanny hobbled when she crossed the room. She would listen to shady stories, but she wouldn’t tell them. She went with [MASK] for years and never gave an inch.” “Never did what?” “Never slept with him, I mean.”
<name>J. Edgar</name>	J. Edgar	Duncan	Now don’t you ever mention it, especially not to him.” I guess it was enough to make a Hoover man of him, [MASK] thought, and as quickly as that the gap of sympathy that had stood all these years between his uncle and himself was closed.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Duncan	He did not bat an eye. It seemed that his face darkened slightly, as though dark had come strongly between them through the front door when [MASK] opened it. “I might drop by the jail and get that nigger,” he said.
<name>isn't</name>	isn't	Tinker	I knew that as the person I used to know, she just didn’t exist any more, not for me.” “Not an attractive woman any more?” “Attractive woman? Oh, now, that’s different, [MASK]. And not fair.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Duncan	“You wouldn’t catch me on a deal like that. I used to have this awful crush on [MASK]. I still just think he’s wonderful. But you know what I’d tell him? I’d tell him to go jump in the lake.”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Lucy	“Was she a real white lady?” [MASK] asked. She portioned out the batter in cakes on the hot griddle. “W.B?s mama? She wasn’t any prize. She looked like she was about half-starved, just like you.”
<name>him</name>	him	Beck	There wasn’t no white lady.” “You tell [MASK] to stay gone from here. ’Cause if I see him it ain’t going to make no difference if there was a white lady or there wasn’t a white lady.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Jimmy	The police were expecting to get the straight dope on who shot [MASK] within the next hour or so, and were going to wire the minute they knew. The boy at the telegraph office will run the wire over to the speaking, and if he finds you first he’ll give it to you.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Duncan	First the thickening waistline, then the bald spot in the back. You won’t be able to get away either, when old ladies stop you on the street. Only you won’t be too nice to leave, like [MASK]. You’ll be too bored to try.”
<name>you</name>	you	Duncan	But you know what I’d tell him? I’d tell him to go jump in the lake.” “But suppose—suppose it was me instead of [MASK]? What would you do then?” She stared at him a moment and then burst out laughing.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Travis	“They don’t want me. I don’t kid myself none. They don’t even like me. When they voted for me before they’s voting for [MASK], just on account of he couldn’t succeed himself.
<name>He</name>	He	Tinker	You wants to come and speak with her? ” [MASK] followed her inside, through a dim hallway where a door led off into a large room with a bed in the corner and chairs grouped around a cold fireplace.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Holcomb	It’s dangerous on the roads now. I have to take [MASK] and the shotgun with me when I go to town in the buggy. If those little niggers appreciated what you’re doing they’d come back. The answer is they don’t appreciate it.
<name>Alabama</name>	Alabama	Miss’ippi	It’s enough to make you sick. That fool Truman. Trying to tell the finest general of our time how to fight a war. Trying to tell us down here in [MASK] what we got to do for niggers.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Harper	Then up at the jail, okay, you wrapped that one up, picture and all. But two weeks later [MASK] gets the nigger to come out and say it was a put-up job and what then? You don’t lay a finger on the nigger.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jimmy	What did he have with him, the atom bomb?” “I can’t hurt him,” [MASK] said. “It’s still my place, goddam it, you haven’t moved your wheels and tables up there yet. I got my reasons and I stick to them.”
<name>he</name>	he	Kerney	“I’m not going to tell anything,” she said. “I didn’t hear anything you said anyway. I wasn’t even listening. I was thinking how well you looked”—her voice caught—“in your gray suit.” “A likely story,” [MASK] said.
<name>Wolfe</name>	Wolfe	Tallant	When the flash went off, I noticed him standing there by me, just a little to the back.” “Then you think it’s one of [MASK]’s concoctions.” “Yes, and I half suspect the Negro of being in on it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Willard	“It don’t signify no more to me than a axe ringing. You take just this morning. I heard two right close together off down towardjuh the creek.” “That day,” said [MASK], “you never heard but one.
<name>Lord Peter</name>	Lord Peter	Jimmy	“You’d better be joking.” “Sure, I’m joking.” [MASK] got up and stood with his back to the fire, empty glass in hand, warming himself. “Haven’t we all been joking tonight?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Kerney	[MASK] watched her, smiling, and started to follow, but she came right back in, running with a slightly mannered little gaiety that was nonetheless attractive. “It won’t stick,” she said. “The ground’s not frozen.”
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Travis	Standing, he propped himself up on a stout short walking stick. Two deputies were with him. They remarked that in time past [MASK] would have asked them in the office and offered them a drink, but they understood everything was changed.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Duncan	[MASK] rose and walked up the trampled grass between the rows of seats. People craned to see his face, but it showed nothing. He walked easily and steadily, for he had once learned well how to pass through a cheering gauntlet as though nothing had happened.
