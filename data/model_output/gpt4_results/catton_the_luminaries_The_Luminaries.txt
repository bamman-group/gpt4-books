<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Anna	“Do you mean to find employment—as a barmaid, perhaps?” “I can tend bar,” [MASK] said. “I’ve done hotel work. I’ve a steady hand, and I’m honest.” “Have you a reference?”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Devlin	“Where exactly did you find this document?” “I found it in the ash drawer at the bottom of the stove,” said [MASK]. “The place had an unhappy atmosphere, and the day was very wet; I decided to light a fire.
<name>Wemmick</name>	Wemmick	Wells	“You’re his partner.” [MASK] spat out the word. “No: I’m obliged to him, that’s all. He stood me eight pounds, and I’m to make him an investment, in return.” “You’re his partner.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Lowenthal	“It’s not work, exacdy. I just wanted to talk with you about something.” “It is never work, talking with you,” [MASK] replied generously, and then, for the fourth time, “But you must come in.”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Moody	He waited. “To be frank with you, sir,” [MASK] said, turning squarely to face the other man, “I discovered certain particulars concerning the ship’s cargo, while aboard, that made me doubt her errand was an honest one.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Crosbie	When I heard of [MASK]’s death, it seemed the perfect opportunity. I could start anew in a place where business was sure to be good—and I could also be close to his grave, which I very much desired.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Frost	“There is am- pie reason not to trust her,” he said coldly. “As I have just chronicled for you.” “But personally,” [MASK] said. “As a woman. I gather that your impression of her integrity is very low.”
<name>Soames</name>	Soames	Pritchard	“Ah Sook, maybe.” “Accuse the man who’s accusing you?” She laughed. “That’s a guilty man’s game!” “I’m trying to help you!” [MASK] said furiously. “I’m trying to help!”
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Lydia	“But let us not talk of the past; let us talk of the present, and the future, and all that lies ahead. Tell me about the conversions you will make to this hotel.” [MASK] was pleased to be given the stage.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Anna	“But I meant to return.” “And despite the fact—perhaps—that he had contracted you to remain until the morning.” “I’m telling you,” [MASK] said, “I only meant to be gone a little while.”
<name>Frodo</name>	Frodo	Anna	He leaped aside. “Oh—yes, of course. You’d best be getting on. A very good morning to you both.” “It was very nice to see you again,” said [MASK].
<name>the man</name>	the man	Moody	He withdrew his forearm from the loop of rope, twisted it into a figure-eight, and secured it onto his swag. Once it was affixed, he sat back on his haunches, regarded [MASK] coolly for a moment, and then leaned over and spat, very deliberately, into the dirt.
<name>Godspeed</name>	Godspeed	Lowenthal	“I do not do odd jobs,” he said, placing six pennies on the countertop. “Go on down to the Godspeed.” [MASK] insisted. “Nobody’s going to ask you any questions. You have the perfect excuse.”
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Margaret	Picked up [MASK]’s pistol from beside his bed, put the muzzle to his temple, and that was that. Then he tried to run, of course, but he was stupid about it. He didn’t get further than the edge of the quay.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Lowenthal	[MASK] pushed his chair back from the table. “I will attend,” he said, standing, and moving to fetch a box of matches from the shelf beside the door. “But there’s someone else I think ought to be present also.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tauwhare	“Half-shares,” the boy was saying. “Seemed fair enough to me. Half for you, half for me. What about it, he says. Going mates.” [MASK] was calculating the distance in his mind.
<name>Trabb</name>	Trabb	Moody	I’ve gone into business with a perfect swindler, I thought.” The boy was getting ahead of himself. [MASK] coughed, to remind him of the narrative sequence upon which they had agreed, and said, “Let’s go back to the night of the eleventh of October.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Anna	You’re quite sure there were no young women aboard?” “I’m sure there’s a simple explanation,” [MASK] said. “Perhaps she took ill at the last minute. Or perhaps she sent a letter with apologies, and it was misdirected.”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Wells	“What’s next?” said [MASK], who was out of humor. “A party for diggers—with a riffle-box on each table, and a tailrace from the bar? ‘In honor of the common man,’ you could say.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gascoigne	When she reached the corset, she made a little slice beneath each stay, and then reached up with her fingers to loose the gold from where it had been stuffed, in panels, between the bones. It was these lumpy parcels that had so reminded [MASK] of chainmail, in the gaol-house.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Anna	“—but I have never heard of a person suddenly acquiring the ability to read,” he finished. “That is most peculiar.” There was a skeptical accent in his voice. “I never had a nanny,” [MASK] said again.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Balfour	“Lucky to have you,” the clergyman said, and [MASK] blushed. “You know,” he said angrily, “it doesn’t count as a confession, just because it sounds like a secret, and you heard it on the sly.”
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Nilssen	When they exhausted the former subject, they fell back upon the latter, an arrangement that kept them in conversation for a great while. [MASK]’s pipe had gone out. He rapped the bowl against his desktop to empty the ash and then began to refill it.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Wells	“In actual fact, it is in a safe box at the bank,” she said. “I don’t keep a copy at home. If you wait just a—” “Rot,” said [MASK]. “It’s on your necklace.”
<name>Wickenden</name>	Wickenden	Jock	versation. “With respect to the ship rig. My argument is simply that how one conceives of the advantages depends entirely on where one stands. [MASK] holds his perspective as a former able seaman; I hold mine as a ship owner and a gentleman.
<name>He</name>	He	Anna	If you are in a difficult position, I may be able to help you; but I cannot help you if you do not trust me. I am asking you to take me into your confidence, and tell me what you know.” [MASK] was frowning.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Tauwhare	Yes. Yes. I’ve been lost.” [MASK] came forward and knelt. Up close the man’s wound looked even worse. In the center of the blackness was a thick crust, showing through it the glint of yellow.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gascoigne	Abruptly she stopped speaking, turned, and peered at him. [MASK] had been taking a draught of his cigarette; he paused at the end of the intake, his chest expanded, and made a gesture with his hands to ask how much.
<name>Providence</name>	Providence	Godspeed	The day after the wedding, the groom received a large cash payment from the Garrity Group, with which his creditors were paid in full, the last of the copper plating was pried from [MASK]'s hull, and the bones of the ship were given up, at long last, for salvage.
<name>Snufkin</name>	Snufkin	Balfour	Don’t tell me what I ought to have done, and how I ought to have done it. I can’t bear that. A game plays how a game plays.” “Well,” said [MASK], sitting back, “I’m blowed.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Edgar	“Oh—you have always been such a father to me, [MASK]—I don’t mind telling you. He meant it as a present! Two thousand pounds, as a present, all at once. He loves me. He’s loved me all along!”
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Anna	He must have disappeared sometime after I left him.” “Sometime after ten o’clock, in other words.” “Yes,” said [MASK]. “I waited for him to come back—and he didn’t—and the days kept passing, with no sign of him.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Pritchard	Maybe even since her overdose.” “What about the opium itself? Did you examine her supply?” “I couldn’t find it,” [MASK] said. “I turned over her whole drawer, looking for it—but the lump was gone.”
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Lowenthal	“ ‘Maori guide, very experienced, fluent in English, locally knowledgeable, offers services to surveyors, diggers, explorers, and the like. Success and safety guaranteed.’” “Surveyors, diggers, explorers,” repeated [MASK], as he wrote.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Balfour	“There’s no need—I can begin right away!” he exclaimed. “I know exactly where the contract is. It’s packed in my trunk, in that shipping crate you’re taking care of for me.” [MASK] felt his guts clench.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Harrington	“That will be all.” [MASK] was bent over his ledger, writing furiously. Now he ripped out the page upon which he had been scribbling, and thrust it down the bench for the other men to read.
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Moody	He might have simply apologized for his discomfiture, and admitted some kind of general malaise—the man seemed sympathetic enough, with his strumming fingers, and his rising gurgle of a laugh—but [MASK] was not in the habit of speaking candidly to strangers, and still less of confessing illness to another man.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carver	Did you see her when the bruises were going down? Did you know that she had to use a cane for two weeks? Just to be able to walk! Did you know that?” At last [MASK] said, “Her hands weren’t clean.”
<name>Chilton</name>	Chilton	Pritchard	He would have to purchase one, discreetly, and learn to use it on his own. He had just spent the sum total of his dust upon the opium he had purchased from [MASK]’s emporium, and he had no more money at his disposal.
<name>She</name>	She	Anna	Aloud he said, “How long do you have?” [MASK] wound a scrap of ribbon into a vicious ball before answering. “He didn’t say. He said I had to raise the money or get out.” “Would you like me to talk to him?”
<name>Thaddeus</name>	Thaddeus	Lowenthal	This was the first time he had ever been insulted in his own office, and his shock was such that he could not immediately respond. He felt an exhilaration building within him; a pressure; an exultant, roaring sound. [MASK] was the kind of man who became almost gladiatorial when he was shamed.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Clinch	May I trespass upon your hospitality for a few hours?” “Trespass—there’s no trespassing!” [MASK] cried, coming forward to take her hands in his. “Why—yes—of course, of course! You must come into my office!
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Anna	Top price.” The widow laughed. “Oh,” [MASK] said. She had flushed very red. “No. You can’t do that. I suppose nobody told you. I’m done with whoring now. I’m not a whore any longer.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Anna	“You don’t happen to know the precise hour of your birth, do you?” “I believe I was born at night,” said [MASK], blushing again. “That’s the way my mother tells it. But I don’t know the precise hour.”
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Clinch	“Lor a time, she said! Give a girl an inch and she takes a bloody mile! Not on my watch, all right! Not with a hundred pounds against her name! No indeed!” [MASK] was looking at the magnate coldly.
<name>Challoner</name>	Challoner	Nilssen	He stared intently at his host and waited. At length [MASK] resumed, struggling to keep his voice calm and practical: “We mustn’t keep anything back. We must go to the justice ourselves—” “And risk the charge?”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Lowenthal	His mouth was wide, and his nose flattened; his brow protruded squarely. Upon his left cheek was a thin scar, silvery in color, which curved from the outer corner of his eye down to his jaw. [MASK]’s hesitation was only momentary.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Balfour	Is this something between the two of “No!” [MASK] said. “No, no. I was tipped off, that’s all.” “Tipped off? By whom?” “I can’t say.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Carver	“If you called it bad news,” he said. “I’m going to wager that you were listening for a good long while.” “Yes,” said the chaplain humbly. “I was. It was a name that caught my attention.” “[MASK]?”
<name>He</name>	He	Lauderback	“That is correct.” “And you wish to refuse him access to this money.” “Also correct.” “On what grounds?” [MASK] turned very red. “On what grounds?” he cried.
<name>Jekyll</name>	Jekyll	Pritchard	Some three weeks ago the clerk had come to his laboratory, seeking to fill a prescription for a bowel complaint—absurdly, [MASK] thought of that now. He wondered whether his tincture had helped the other man as he had promised it would.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Gascoigne	Perhaps that is what captured everyone’s attention?” “Oh, she wasn’t gaoled for whoring,” [MASK] said. “The sergeants don’t care a straw about that! As long as a man is discreet enough, they are quite content to look the other way.”
<name>He</name>	He	Moody	He was wearing a collarless black coat and a white necktie—a clergyman’s dress, [MASK] realized, with some surprise. That was strange. Why should a cleric elect to get his news in the smoking room of a common hotel, late on a Saturday night?
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Pritchard	The bowl of the pipe sat some three inches away from its end; it protruded like a doorknob, and was fixed to the wood by means of a metal saddle. [MASK] weighed the thing in his hands, holding it as a flautist holds a flute.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Lauderback	“What was the true value of the gold in the trunk—to your eye?” “I’m no prospector,” [MASK] said, “but by the weight of the gowns I’d estimate it was a couple of thousand, at least.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Lowenthal	What is the phrase—an eye for an eye?” “I didn’t say that.” “She killed your child? She killed your child—so you killed hers?” [MASK] was almost shouting. “Say the words, man!
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Anna	Of course, [MASK] comes home from gaol in a different dress, the very next day—and then, after she quits the place, I find out the other dresses have been stripped. It was the leaden makeweights that I was feeling.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Gascoigne	“Then I will make another request,” [MASK] said. “I request that your presence in my house is of as short a dui'ation as possible. If you have further questions, you ought to make them now—but I have told you everything I know about that gold.”
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Balfour	[MASK] found a cigar, bit off its end, and placed it between his teeth; then he struck his match, angled it so the flame caught, and held the flame to the square end of the cigar.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Gascoigne	“And I shall make some inquiries of my own.” “The insurance money did come through. [MASK] was as good as his word.” Presendy she said, “Let’s to bed.” “You’ve had a trying day.”
<name>Grimesby</name>	Grimesby	Staines	“We don’t know half the players, man! If [MASK] was murdered—look, even if you don’t believe the rest of what I’m saying, you must admit that it’s a d—ned coincidence he disappeared when he did.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Devlin	He asked with his eyebrows whether the chaplain meant to step inside. “They’re all abed, I’m afraid,” he said, his voice low. “That’s all right,” said [MASK], also speaking quietly. “I’ll only be a moment.”
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Magistrate	I wonder if he’s angling for a shot at [MASK]. He’s done very well on the Commissioner’s budget—to get everything moving so smartly. He’s done very well indeed.” “I suppose he has. Hark at that one!”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Gascoigne	Then she burst out, “Every man wants his whore to be unhappy—every man!” [MASK] blew out a narrow jet of smoke. “Most whores are unhappy,” he said. “Forgive me: I only state a simple truth.”
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Balfour	It was an argument that [MASK] would ordinarily find engrossing, but the expression on the shipping agent’s face was anxious and detached. He was tapping the base of his glass against the table, and shifting in his seat, and, every few minutes, reaching up to pull hard on his nose.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Lauderback	“Making out as if all the town deserved a reprimand on the girl’s account—as if every fellow was at fault.” “Who’s to credit his opinion?” [MASK] waved his hand dis-missively.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Lauderback	Leave off the almshouses, and let’s not go turning any of our girls into nuns. That would be a d—ned shame, when they are so outnumbered as it is.” [MASK] snorted. “Outnumbered and outfoxed, I see,” he said.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Gascoigne	[MASK] had first encountered the widow on Thursday afternoon, when the latter arrived at the Magistrate’s Court to inquire after her late husband’s fortune—a fortune that had already been found, and banked, by other men.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Anna	“I shall make the first wreath, as a template,” she said to [MASK], “and you can do the rest this afternoon: I will guide you through the steps, and show you how to tuck the ends away.”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Devlin	A sudden gust of wind flattened the tussock around where [MASK] stood, blowing his hair back from his temples. “Good afternoon,” he called. “Good afternoon,” returned the other, squinting slightly. “I see that we are neither of us deterred by a spot of foul weather!”
<name>He</name>	He	Mannering	he wished to remain, all the same, in the boy’s good opinion. [MASK] was competitive by nature, and among the many hypothetical trophies for which he competed daily was one engraved with the names of every one of his associates.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Anna	“Oh,” said [MASK]. He drained his glass and set it down. “Are you partial to a drink or not?” “Not today, thank you.” He reached into his pocket, withdrew something, and then held up a closed fist.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lydia	“You were so looking forward to your surprise.” [MASK] pressed his sleeve. “No,” she said firmly. “The poor dear has been surprised enough. It’s high time she was given reason to relax; high time she was cared for.
<name>John</name>	John	Lowenthal	He did not say what was inside the crate, beyond the fact that its personal value was considerable; he spoke gruffly, and used very plain words. When [MASK] asked his name, he did not answer. Instead he pulled a birth certificate from his pocket and laid it on the desk.
<name>Flanagan</name>	Flanagan	Carver	“Hey, now—that’s a corker!” For he had struck the gull across the back with his stick. “You don’t happen to know what [MASK] was booked for—do you, lad?” “Trafficking,” the stevedore said immediately.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Anna	It was the leaden makeweights that I was feeling. The whole plan’s gone to custard. I’ve got a piece of land I don’t want, and no money to call my own, and [MASK]—well. You know about her.”
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Anna	“We are perfect strangers.” “He mentioned that you had recently lost a child.” “Lost!” said [MASK], in a voice full of disgust. “Lost1 That’s a sanitary word.” “You would use a different one?”
<name>Corcoran</name>	Corcoran	Clinch	“I’m not so sure,” [MASK] said. “Last week, you see, I told her she had to make good her debts before she quit walking the streets—and we had words, and I suppose I got angry, and I threatened to turn her out of the hotel.”
<name>Phileas</name>	Phileas	Staines	“Yes; here to make my fortune, or at least, to chance upon it: I confess I do not quite understand the difference. Oh!” He snatched off his hat. “How outrageously rude of me. I haven’t introduced myself. [MASK] is my name.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Moody	[MASK] had no small genius for the art of diplomacy. As a child he had known instinctively that it was always better to tell a partial truth with a willing aspect than to tell a perfect truth in a defensive way.
<name>Lin</name>	Lin	Clinch	Why, [MASK] thought, that task would be easy enough: one only needed to feed her a pipe of opium, and wait for her to drift into sleep, and thereafter the gold could be sewn into her dress, one pinch at a time. Perhaps...
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Westland	He’s trying to get the gaol-house underway before [MASK] gets her seat, and he’s using a private investment to spur the enterprise along. Oh-ho! I shall have something to say about this in the Times—rest assured!”
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Carver	“Yes: [MASK] had heard about it. He asked me if I’d put in a word for him. He was going down to the quay in the morning to apply. Asked me the favor man to man.” “You did as he asked?”
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Shepard	If [MASK] was the subject of idle rumor, it was of the conjectural sort, and nearly always concerned his private relations with his wife. Their marriage was to all appearances conducted in absolute silence, with a grim determination on his part, and a fearful inhibition on hers.
<name>Chink</name>	Chink	Sook	“What’s the difference?” responded the other. “He’s still a Chinaman. He still stinks.” “He doesn’t have a pistol,” the first man pointed out. “He’ll give us [MASK]. They’re all in thick.”
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Moody	[MASK], upon receiving these advance documents, had sat down at once to refine his two-part strategy—for he knew very well that the impression created in the morning would do much to shape the verdict delivered in the afternoon.
<name>Thornhill</name>	Thornhill	Moody	“So I hope,” [MASK] said. “I have heard that a man might make a competence in four months or less, which would take me away from here before the worst months of winter. Is that a probable expectation, in your mind?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Moody	He levered himself from his armchair with a grunt of effort and shuffled off to join the others at the sideboard. When he had gone, [MASK] found him- self alone before the fire with the man in the herringbone suit; the latter now leaned forward and spoke.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Moody	“But let me put the contrary question to you. What about a soul—a living soul? Do you believe that you can ‘know’ a person who is living, if you cannot ‘know’ a person who is dead?” [MASK] considered this, smiling.
<name>He</name>	He	Clinch	It was certainly a mystery, the salvage man concluded. He hoped that she would not come to any embarrassment or difficulty, in wearing them. [MASK] pressed on. “How are you to keep your wits about you, when you’re under?
<name>White</name>	White	Lauderback	White in color. Shaped like—like a sickle.” [MASK] pursed his Ups, then shook his head. “I don’t recall a scar.” “But he was dark-haired? Thick-set? Brutish, you might say?”
<name>Thornton</name>	Thornton	Lauderback	“Made a swap, did you—something bigger?” “No: I sold her, outright.” “For gold?” [MASK] paused, and then said, “Yes.” “That so!”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gascoigne	[MASK] was salting his plate. “I have heard that in the New Zealand native tradition, the soul, when it dies, becomes a star.” “That is the best recommendation I have yet heard, to go native.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nilssen	“I don’t know,” said [MASK], momentarily confused. “I mean, yes, maybe.” “Are you with him, or against him?” “I—I don’t know.”
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Moody	That sand will ground a schooner on the wrong tide.” “I well believe it,” [MASK] said. “Our vessel was a barque—none too large, agile, hardy enough to weather the most dreadful of storms—and yet the captain wouldn’t risk her.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Moody	They were gazing at him with more or less the same expression of hopeful expectation—the emotion betrayed, restrained, or displayed, according to the temper of the man. So I am to be the unraveler, [MASK] thought. The detective: that is the role I am to play.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Moody	“But now it seems that he can only be dead.” [MASK] tapped his fingers, brooding. “And gone forever, no doubt. Hang not knowing! I would give any money for a seat at the widow’s seance tonight.”
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Devlin	Turning the pages of the translated document, [MASK] had wondered how the holy message had been simplified, and at what cost. The unfamiliar words in their truncated alphabet seemed infantile to him, composed of repeating syllables and babble—unrecognizable, like the nonsense of a child.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Moody	[MASK] squared the edges of the letters in his hands. He ought to have rung the bell for the maid an hour ago, and demanded the trunk be removed from his room; he would invite suspicion if he delayed any further. He wondered what he should do.
<name>Fezziwig</name>	Fezziwig	Balfour	[MASK], who was always very happy to play the role of the munificent host, ordered three bowls of clear soup, a round of bread, a fat black pudding, a hard cheese, sardines in oil, hot buttered carrots, a pot of stewed oysters, and a demijohn of stout.
