<name>Georg</name>	Georg	Bon	They flirted shamelessly with me and teased [MASK] and the American husband with the walrus mustache, now awake. Both merely grimaced and made themselves as still and small as they could, quite aware of the grim silence of their wives.
<name>Lev</name>	Lev	Sonny	Except for him, most of our fellow exiles had been shrunken by their experience, either absolutely through the aforementioned maladies of migration, or relatively, surrounded by Americans so tall they neither looked through nor looked down on these newcomers. They simply looked over them. For [MASK], it was the opposite.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bon	Even as I was planning for the possibility of returning, I also did my best to dissuade [MASK] of doing the same. We were smoking a final cigarette under the oak tree, our last gesture before embarking on a ten-mile hike.
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Richard	The table rippled with unembarrassed laughter, and for some reason I felt that it was I who was the butt of the joke. The entirety? said the Congressman. Come on, [MASK]. I’d be amazed if anybody here even read more than the back cover and the blurbs.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Madame	Not only this, [MASK] added, but the two of you made a spectacle out of yourselves at the nightclub. Everyone saw it. The General sighed. That you would attempt to defile her, he said, was something I could hardly believe.
<name>John</name>	John	Bon	Once again I was trapped by circumstances, and once again I would soon see another man trapped by circumstances. The only compensation for my sadness was the expression on [MASK]’s face. It was the first time he had looked happy in a year. CHAPTER 6
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Bon	By September and just in time for the academic year, [MASK] and I were reunited in genteel poverty in our apartment. Then, with what remained of my sponsor’s money, I went to a downtown pawnshop and bought the last of life’s necessities, a radio and a television.
<name>Henrik</name>	Henrik	Linh	While it was easy enough to spread the manure of encouragement among soldiers drilled into accepting all kinds of abuse, we had forgotten that most of the refugees were civilians. In retrospect, I was fortunate not to be wearing my uniform, stained with [MASK]’s blood.
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Rita	[MASK] immediately sympathized. She was the domestic equivalent of her husband, an anticommunist warrior housewife to whom nothing was just an isolated incident but was almost always a symptom by which the disease of communism could be linked to poverty, depravity, atheism, and decay of many kinds.
<name>Quell</name>	Quell	Man	Like blood. He pointed to the scar in the palm of the hand holding the cigarette, carved to follow the lifeline’s arc. Remember? I held up the palm of my right hand with its matching scar, the same one carried by [MASK].
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Sonny	Click, clack went the gun, one bullet behind the ear, another in the skull, and [MASK] fell face-first with enough graceless weight to break his nose. I stood over his prone body, cheek down on the carpet, copious amounts of blood gushing from the holes drilled in his head.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Claude	But he would not have been able to do so if I had simply executed my role as the mole. Instead, I confess I took pleasure in doing what I was supposed to do and not supposed to do, interrogate him until he broke, as [MASK] had requested.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Claude	Who would have thought we’d be here again? But I got you out of the north then, and I’m getting you out of the south now. You’ll be all right. After [MASK] left, I returned to the evacuees.
<name>MacArthur</name>	MacArthur	MacArthur	According to this ever-proliferating gossip, the General was either going to send these fools to their deaths from his armchair or he was going to return, like [MASK] to the Philippines, to lead the heroic invasion himself.
<name>Stevenson</name>	Stevenson	Mori	It was in this state that I tookMs. [MASK] to the dance floor after the wedding cake was cut, and it was then, near the stage, that I recognized one of the two female singers taking turns at the microphone with our gay blade.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Bon	There was another reason the General wanted to see me in person, however, or so [MASK] reported a few days later on returning from the store. He had just been hired as the store’s clerk, a job he could manage while also cleaning the reverend’s church part-time.
<name>Essentially</name>	Essentially	Homosexual	I sat down immediately at my desk and wrote the Watchman’s confession for him. He read my scenario the next morning in disbelief, then read it again before glaring at me. You’re saying that I’m saying I’m a faggot? [MASK], I corrected.
<name>we</name>	we	Sonny	Her gaze was loaded with pity, which was ever only served lukewarm. Longing flooded the basement of my heart, and all I could do was nod mutely. She went to the kitchen and retrieved clean tumblers for the vodka while [MASK] and I sat in awkward silence.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Madame	Country club, huh? He chuckled. I’ll have to remember that. I watched him walk up the pathway to his darkened house, where [MASK] was likely reading in bed, staying awake for his return, as she had waited so often in the villa.
<name>Vampires</name>	Vampires	Charlie	Even in my somnambulent state I knew that white was not only the color of purity and innocence. It was also the sign of mourning and death. CHAPTER 8 We own the day, but [MASK] owns the night. Never forget that.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Claude	This was small talk, get-to-know-you kind of stuff, but lurking underneath the flirtation was our mutual awareness of our roles as prisoner and interrogator. My awareness was compounded by knowing that [MASK] was watching us on the video monitor.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Professor	Do you ever regret being a communist, [MASK]? No, I do not. Only by making that mistake could I be what I am today. What is that, sir? He smiled. I suppose you could call me a born-again American.
<name>Beefcake</name>	Beefcake	Sarge	As to how they had managed to infiltrate this airbase, when evacuations were meant for the rich, the powerful, and/or the connected, it was all because of [MASK]. I imagined a slab of beefcake on two legs with a white marine’s cap perched on top.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Madame	With me, however, he held on and said, Just a word, Captain. I stepped aside to let the other passengers board. Yes, sir? You know [MASK] and I look on you as our adopted son, said the General.
<name>Stalin</name>	Stalin	Stalin	CHAPTER 19 Only from death? The commandant appeared genuinely wounded, his finger resting on the last words of my confession. In his other hand was a blue pencil, the color chosen because [MASK] had also used a blue pencil, or so he told me.
<name>Congress</name>	Congress	Congress	I am here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a hand of temporary bad luck, for your soldiers fought well and bravely, and would have prevailed if only [MASK] had remained as steadfast in their support of you as the president promised.
<name>Chatterjee</name>	Chatterjee	Bon	I do not. I could only try to understand whether he was fooling me as he skipped the pleasantries of inquiring about my dubious health, physical and mental, and announced that [MASK] and I were leaving both camp and country.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Harry	I was sure to be defenseless after my fourth or fifth such drink at this party, which took place under the stars as well as under a huge thatched pavilion that served as the canteen. After trading jokes with [MASK], I watched the men of the crew crowd around the few white girls on the set.
<name>Dexter</name>	Dexter	Bon	I put my hand on the Walther P22 in the tote bag but I could not find the will to stand up, follow him into the kitchen, and quickly put a bullet behind his ear as [MASK] had advised. It’s the merciful thing to do, he said.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bon	This man has already tried twice to flee from this country and been caught both times. This third time, with you and [MASK], he will succeed. His plan left me in a daze. How do you know that? I said at last.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Lana	It was almost always foggy, and one was likely to trip and fall. But perhaps this embarrassing collapse was worth it, for [MASK], to my even greater astonishment, embraced him and pressed his stubborn, ugly head against her cheek.
<name>Callahan</name>	Callahan	Bon	Their cold bodies had lain in a naval morgue overnight, cause of death now official: a single slug, type unknown. The bullet would forever spin in [MASK]’s mind on a perpetual axis, taunting and haunting him with the even chance of coming from friend or foe.
<name>Yuki</name>	Yuki	Bon	The Japanese stewardesses were serving tempura and tonkatsu, which tasted better than the last word the General had forced into my mouth at the departure gate. In between the walls, [MASK] said, listening to other people live, coming out only at night. I can breathe now.
<name>Bobby</name>	Bobby	Mai	This was also the only scene I had not seen filmed. The Auteur used no music, the agony unreeling with only [MASK]’s screams and protests, underscored by the VC quartet’s laughing, cursing, and jeering.
<name>Marlene</name>	Marlene	Bon	Still smarting from my wounds even now, I cannot help but wonder, writing this confession, whether I own my own representation or whether you, my confessor, do. The sight of [MASK] waiting for me at the Los Angeles airport made me feel a little better.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Madame	But the exigencies of exile had made it necessary for [MASK] to cook, as no one else in the household was capable of anything more than boiling water. In the General’s case, even that was beyond him.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Madame	I won’t allow rock music in this house, she said, gripping [MASK]’s hand to console her for the loss of her daughter’s virtue. None of my children will be allowed to date until eighteen and, so long as they live in this house, will have a curfew by ten.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Bon	Fear inflated the balloon of my heart and I pressed my cheek into the earth. Being on the bank’s downward slope saved us from the ambuscade, keeping us below the eyeline sight of the forest’s vengeful ghosts. Shoot, goddammit, said [MASK].
<name>Americans</name>	Americans	Americans	Red blackout lamps cast an eerie glow over the crowds, among which was a scattering of [MASK]. All of them appeared to be husbands of Vietnamese women, given how a Vietnamese family besieged each of them, or how a Vietnamese woman had practically handcuffed herself to his arm.
<name>Maxim</name>	Maxim	Claude	Fingering that slip of paper, I recalled the cinematic scenario I had prepared, the one where I refused to board [MASK]’s plane while the General pleaded hopelessly with me to leave with him. I want to stay, I said. It’s almost over.
<name>Choukri</name>	Choukri	Claude	Each of the family heads had the laissez-passer documents from the Ministry of the Interior I had bought at a hefty discount, as well as the presidential parole delivered by [MASK], stamped by the relevant embassy clerk.
<name>Marcel</name>	Marcel	Claude	Her somber children sat in the Citroen s backseat, a blank, diplomatic mien on their faces as they observed [MASK] and the General smoking in front of the car’s headlights. Passenger manifest in hand, I called the men and their families forward, checking off their names and directing them to their buses.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Claude	[MASK], who did not believe in her or any god, gave us his secular blessing in the form of high fives as we left. Good luck, he said. Just in and out. Quick and quiet. Easier said than done, I thought.
<name>Yoko</name>	Yoko	Violet	No words, just screams. So you should at least get the screams right. » Screams are universal. Am I right, [MASK]. You’re right, she said from where she sat next to me. Screams are not universal, I said.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	American	This other component is [MASK]. You see the look in our patient’s eyes? He remembers what he has seen in those interrogation rooms. But we will not be wiring him via nipple and scrotum to the battery terminals on the phones generator.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bon	We both looked at each other for a moment and then he smiled and said, I’m being a bad host. I haven’t even offered you a drink. How about it? Despite my protestations, he leaped up and went to the kitchen, exactly as [MASK] predicted.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Sonny	My intuition told me [MASK] had actually read some of them in their entirety, and taking a seat next to him I could feel an anaphylactic reaction to his presence prickling on my skin, an eruption of hostility inflamed by his genial smile. What do you have there?
<name>Carlos</name>	Carlos	Claude	When he took his fingers out of his ears and I lowered the volume, he looked up at one of the cameras and shouted in English, Fuck you, Americans! [MASK] chuckled. At least he’s talking. It’s the ones who don’t say anything you really have to worry about.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Claude	So, I said, situation normal. [MASK] nodded. All fucked up. Let’s just hope history forgets the snafus. This was the prayer many a general and politician said before they went to bed, but some snafus were more justifiable than others.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bon	The wallet I would dispose of tomorrow, along with the license plates, the plastic bag, and the ashes. When I handed him a glass of rye, I saw the red scar on his hand. Here’s to the major, [MASK] said.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Claude	Many people who heard their voices on tape thought that they did not sound like themselves, which they found disturbing, and he was no exception. He heard this stranger’s voice say, I saw everything. [MASK] told me that this was nasty business, but that I had to see it.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bon	I said as [MASK] bagged the bottles. You really think he’s a spy? What do I know about it? I’m just a grunt. You do as you’re told. So do you, smart guy. Since you’re so smart, you plan this.
<name>John</name>	John	SHAMUS	I don’t hear anything. [MASK] Exactly. It’s the sound of peace. If only! The Movie was not yet complete. An old woman dashed from the cave to fall, wailing, onto the body of her dead VC son.
<name>Major</name>	Major	Sonny	You didn’t see the danger in the major because he was fat and you took pity on him for that. Now the evidence shows that you’ve been willfully blind to the fact that [MASK] is not only a left-wing radical but potentially a communist sleeper agent.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Bon	[MASK] threw his cigarette away and said, Let’s get out of here before I kill somebody. I shrugged. Where to? He pointed over my shoulder, and when I turned I saw the movie poster that had caught his eye.
<name>Reader</name>	Reader	Commandant	No matter whether my eyes were open or shut, I could still see it, the crapulent major’s third eye, weeping because of what it could see about me. CHAPTER 7 I confess that the major’s death troubled me greatly, [MASK], even if it does not trouble you.
<name>James</name>	James	Bon	I poured myself a cup of tea. Is [MASK] a part of this team? Of course. I hate to lose such a good worker, but he’s the best we have for this kind of work. What do you think?
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Man	Of course, as I composed my letters, I was writing to [MASK]. If I started a letter with a few tropes we had agreed on—the weather, my health, the aunt’s health, French politics—then he would know that written in between the lines was another message in invisible ink.
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Sonny	When I looked up I caught a glimpse of the stars through the branches, swirling snowflakes trapped within the glass of a snow globe. [MASK] and the crapulent major laughed faintly as they watched me from outside that snow globe and shook it with their giant hands.
<name>Thuy</name>	Thuy	Madame	[MASK] s pho harkened back to the warmth of my mother’s kitchen, which was probably not as warm as it was in my memories, but never mind—I had to stop periodically to savor not only my soup but the marrow of my memories.
<name>Calvin</name>	Calvin	Bon	The wig, cap, and glasses were [MASK]’s idea. He had made me try the look on in front of the bathroom mirror, foggy with a year’s worth of spattered toothpaste foam. See? he said. Now you’re a white man.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Madame	Standing at the bottom of the steps, the General could not meet the old mans eyes. I’m sorry, he said, head bowed and bared, cap in hand. It was the only time I had heard him apologize to anyone besides [MASK].
<name>Avery</name>	Avery	VC	[MASK]? the man cried, waving his hands in the air. No way! I’m a businessman! Avery good one, too, the major said, hefting a garbage bag filled with the casino’s cash. So you got me there, the man said, miserable.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Bon	Home was a dismal one-bedroom, first-floor apartment whose most characteristic feature was the pervasive odor of belly lint, or so I wrote to my aunt. On that day as on every day previously, I found [MASK] listless with grief on the long tongue of our red velour sofa.
<name>Love</name>	Love	Linh	Then I fell in love, and [MASK] became more important than my father or revenge. I hadn’t cried since he died, but after my marriage I cried at his grave because I had betrayed him where it mattered the most, in my heart.
<name>Irish</name>	Irish	Vietnamese	It’s not her fault, he said. I gave her my number at the wedding and asked for hers, because, I said, wouldn’t it be great if I could write an article about how a Japanese sees us [MASK] ?
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Claude	This, according to [MASK] in his interrogation course, was something certain Native American tribes also inflicted on trespassing white settlers, despite being of a different race thousands of miles away and more than a century past. See?
<name>her</name>	her	Bons	I'm coming back, too, I wrote, even though I had not yet figured out how I would do that. The better to report on the movement of the enemy, I wrote, even though what I really intended was to save [MASK] life.
<name>John</name>	John	Bon	It’s the airport, [MASK] said. Five-hundred-pound bombs. He would turn out to be correct in both cases. From our vantage point, we could see nothing except, after a few moments, billowing plumes of black smoke.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bon	Usually [MASK] used words like a sniper, but this was a spray of machine-gun fire that silenced me for several moments. Then I said, You don’t give these guys enough credit for what they did, for what they faced.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Sonny	THE COMMISSAR But is his father’s life equal? My father? What was this? Even [MASK] and the crapulent major, appalled at the harsh evaluation of their lives and deaths, paused in their agitation to listen. THE COMMANDANT What did he do to his father?
<name>Al</name>	Al	Claude	I told you so! The only thing different in your case is that the poor slob didn’t have time to think about it. If you say so, [MASK], I said. I’m not saying so, he said. It’s in the book.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Bon	Let’s go, I shouted. They’re leaving! I pulled at his sleeve but [MASK] would not move, rooted by grief. I had no choice but to punch him in the jaw, just hard enough to shut him up and loosen his grip.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Violet	But no. We looked, [MASK] told me yesterday, when we had found time to sip iced tea together on the hotel veranda. Frankly, there just weren’t any qualified Vietnamese actors. Most of them were amateurs and the handful of professionals all overacted.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Madame	If I was hearing this gossip, then [MASK] certainly was, and therefore the General, too, all of us tuned in to the humming, crackling AM channel of hearsay. This included the crapulent major, his fat body spilling over the edges of the bucket seat next to me.
<name>André</name>	André	Man	To rendezvous in the church amused [MASK], a former Catholic like me. While we pretended to be devout officers for whom Mass once a week did not suffice, I would confess my political and personal failures to him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bon	As for myself, I could only mumble something generically appropriate to the widow, whose veil cloaked a waterfall of tears. How was it? [MASK] asked when I came home. How do you think? I said, heading for the refrigerator, its ribs lined as always with beer.
<name>Quilty</name>	Quilty	Sonny	It seemed as much of a crime to commit a cliche to paper as to kill a man, an act I had acknowledged rather than confessed, for killing [MASK] and the crapulent major were not crimes in the commandant’s eyes.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Due	I hadn’t cried since he died, but after my marriage I cried at his grave because I had betrayed him where it mattered the most, in my heart. I didn’t get over that until [MASK] was born. At first he was just this strange, ugly little thing.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Sonny	I remember the injustice of how my mother never came to visit me after her death no matter how many times I cried out for her, unlike [MASK] and the crapulent major, whom I would carry with me forever.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bon	* * * The store was empty except for [MASK], watching the phosphorescent, hypnotic signal of a baseball game on a tiny black-and-white television by the cash register. I cashed the check in my pocket, my tax refund from the IRS.
<name>Stefan</name>	Stefan	Madame	You’ll be surprised who gets the medals after the liberation, he said. Would I now? The joke would be on me if the General and [MASK] were sympathizers, too. A joke we could all laugh at when we were commemorated as Heroes of the People.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Bon	I did not tell [MASK] about the letter, of course, but I did tell him of the General’s offer and sought his counsel. He was characteristically blunt. You’re an idiot, he said. But I can’t stop you from going.
<name>Anastasia</name>	Anastasia	Sonny	On hearing of [MASK]’s death, her first thoughts might be confused, but her subsequent thoughts would turn to me, her jilted lover. The General had trusted that I would get the deed done on the date I promised, and he had provided me with my ticket the previous week.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lana	My function was to be a trapping of their past and possibly future life. Their conversation for the hour-long drive revolved mostly around the Congressman until I asked about [MASK], who, I said, struck me as having become all grown up.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Sonny	How could you be a superhero if no one knew you existed? Rumors had already spread about them. Even before the desert assembly, during that night when [MASK] had admitted his failure and yet still won, he had asked me about these mysterious men.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Bon	I wanted to have a child with her. Me, who had never wanted marriage! Who could never imagine being a father! Can I have another drink? Of course! He refilled my glass. You stupid bastard, [MASK]’s voice in my head said.
<name>Francis</name>	Francis	Bon	If youth was not wasted, how could it be youth? Perhaps I could blame youth for my friendship with [MASK]. What drives a fourteen-year-old to swear a blood oath to a blood brother? And more important, what makes a grown man believe in that oath?
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Bon	You’ll do more good there than you will here, this dentist’s son said. And if you won’t do it for yourself, do it for [MASK]. He won’t go if he thinks we’re staying. But in any case, you want to go.
<name>Comrade</name>	Comrade	Commandant	Haven’t I confessed to many things, [MASK]? In content, perhaps, but not in style. Confessions are as much about style as content, as the Red Guards have shown us. All we ask for is a certain way with words. Cigarette?
<name>you</name>	you	Bon	I need you here, but I respect your courage. Unlike [MASK] and the others, however, you’ve never been battlefield tested. He described the grizzled captain and the affectless lieutenant as war heroes, men whom he would trust with his life in combat.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Harry	I learned of this new scene the morning of its shooting, when the Arc Light strike was originally scheduled. Nope, said [MASK]. The special effects guys finished prep-ping the cemetery last night. I love that cemetery. It’s the greatest thing you built.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bon	This feat I also had no idea how to accomplish, but ignorance had never stopped me from taking action before. With no idea how I would manage to betray [MASK] and save him at the same time, I searched for inspiration in the bottom of a bottle.
<name>Max</name>	Max	Bon	That was selfish and weak of me. If I died, you would die, and then [MASK]. The commandant can’t wait to drag him before the firing squad. At least now you can save yourself and our friend, if not me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Claude	Pushed haphazardly against the walls were gray metal folding chairs, while in the back of the room stood a Sony movie projector. On the opposite wall the movie screen served as the backdrop, from where [MASK] watched by the projector, of the agent’s interrogation.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bon	That night, at home, I watched [MASK] clean and oil the .38 Special on the coffee table, then load it with six copper bullets and lay it on a little throw pillow that came with our sofa, a tawdry, stained red velour cushion on which the pistol rested like a gift to deposed royalty.
<name>CIA</name>	CIA	Claude	She was, in short, the ideal Vietnamese woman. For this good fortune, the General was eternally grateful and terrified. Kneading the tip of his scorched finger, he looked at me and said, I think it’s time to ask [MASK] for a plane.
<name>Lonnie</name>	Lonnie	Bon	The only thing that could have made me happier was a companion for [MASK], who, so far as I knew, was also practicing his solo stroke. Always a shy one, he swallowed his pill of Catholicism seriously.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Madame	Maybe then I’ll listen to one or two of your cheap ideas. Why was he so rude? [MASK] said. Didn’t he ask you to give him some comments? He was looking for ayes man. He thought I’d give him a rubber stamp of approval.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Sonny	If he’s dead, he won’t. I could see myself shooting [MASK], having seen such an act so many times in the movies. But I could not see my finger wiggling the slippery fish ball of his eye. Why not just shoot him twice?
