<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Kerrin	She slurred the patience we knew was there, and never spoke of a saner planning that might in time change all our shrunken lives. I was glad of the evenings, even of those when [MASK] talked in her fast and half-ghoulish way.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Grant	- She used to shake it sometimes, but the weather-hand never moved. [MASK] saw me watching, and grinned, knowing I’d seen him peer at it onlv an hour ago when he came up for the buckets.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Merle	She shook her head at [MASK], but not till he’d looked away. ‘Let’s bring the cake in now,’ I whispered. I wanted to light the candles and help her to carry it in, because I had made a part - not much, but sprinkling raisins on here and there.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Aaron	Their not being here gave me more to wonder and think about than if they had come and sat in an ox-like row. [MASK] was different from the rest, with more shape to his face and less thickness between him and his feelings.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Marget	Ain’t she a right to know what’s been going on?’ Then suddenly he changed and sat down. ‘Go on - do what you want. Lie to her. I don’t care. Get me some food, [MASK]; I ain’t coming in to eat.’
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Marget	‘Don’t trust anything natural, [MASK]. -Only the little wheels.’ He looked at its round dull gleam in the starlight, and wiped off the dust from its face. There was a fierce sweet smell from the crab-trees, and I peered up at the stars through their twisted branches.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Max	‘[MASK],’ she’d said, ‘when you finish supper, come help me lift Pop up on the bed.’ They didn’t know till the doctor came that he’d broken his hip in two places.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grant	I forgot to add up what the bought part must have cost, and was glad of the sugar and cinnamon crust. [MASK] took a long breath of the spicy smell and then shook his head. ‘There’re words for most things,’ he said, ‘but none that I know of for this.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	October	and I’d think - when somebody does like this on a scrap of paper, then all these things are gone, and a little scrawl is bigger than trees or valley. But the fear was worse and more heavy after the man had come. It was [MASK] then
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Henry	They stared at us gravely, [MASK]’s face puffed and drawn out with crying. One of the little girls waved. They stopped at the gate, sweat running down off the mules’ hide, and the hair wet-black on their faces under the socket hollows.
<name>Celie</name>	Celie	Lucia	The children shrieked goodbye and [MASK] waved her hand. - Enormous and black and her face twisted up in a sudden flood of crying. The mules crept around the turn where the blasted cornfield was, and were out of sight.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Vlerle	I do not think the doctor knew very much. When her skin turned black in one place, he began to look worried. 'If she’s healed,' [MASK] said, ‘it’ll come more of her own will than out of this stuff he uses.’
<name>water</name>	water	Rathman	He seemed more cheerful in a way, like a man who had touched bottom, going down through so much that no more seemed possible, and had begun to hope. There was no sound. Only once the dry bawling of a thirsty steer a long way off toward [MASK]’s.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Rod	Then 1 saw 1 was wrong when he turned to get up, and that all of the still defiance and tautness was there inside. [MASK]-stiff and quiet. Refusing stubbornly to accept life on its own terms and make for himself a dreary peace.
<name>ever</name>	ever	Kerrin	He didn’t come back when the mess was over, only waved and shouted out something about long-legged fools, which meant all three of them, I guess, and started off up the row singing louder and worse than [MASK].
<name>Miss Lucy</name>	Miss Lucy	Kerrin	She hated me, could not help but feel that this came because of that morning I’d found her, and asked why I didn’t take the place now I’d pried her from it. ‘I’d make a slow teacher, [MASK],’ I told her.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Hutton	I see that they learn, all right. What else is to say? What is it you want to know? - how the room smelt? - who kicked who? - how dumb [MASK]’s kids can be? Maybe you’d like a diagram of their dirt!’
<name>Old Ben</name>	Old Ben	Grant	‘Better to be confused than blind,’ he said. We watched the snake gliding back, and his coils made a dry and scratching sound. [MASK] said that the scales would split off from his eyes first.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Ramsey	For ten years [MASK] had rented land and expected to buy, but all that he ever did was make his rent-money and put up half the crop to go over the winter. In five years they saved fifty dollars and then had to spend it to get a new team.
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Kerrin	[MASK] was at the desk, but didn’t see me. She stared down at her book and mumbled out questions to the class. It was hot almost to oven-heat under the roof, and her hair was damp, lay flat on her head like a heavy scum.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Aaron	Only [MASK] was left of the three to help him. I think the old man had been glad to show them he managed as well alone. He never rested, and looked like a warped old gnome with his hat on top.
<name>Lord Randall</name>	Lord Randall	Grant	I asked him where he would go. I can hear the words now, - quiet, standing off by themselves, having nothing , to do with my hot, sick heart. ‘Where will you go, [MASK]?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Merle	he asked. ‘Has [MASK] gone?’ He spoke as if blind and not seeing me either. ‘She’s here,’ I said. ‘She’s always here. She always will be, I guess.’
<name>Della</name>	Della	Marget	‘- Where’d you get money from?’ I asked. I hadn’t remembered there was a birthday coming, or thought of a thing to give, and it made me angry at her. ‘It’s mine, [MASK]. I earned it!’
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Merle	But the door slammed after and we could not hear his answer except as a loud and angry sound. [MASK] and I stayed, looking at the broken-up cake and the blood, and after a few minutes she stopped crying and was quiet.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Grant	He had too much to do now that [MASK] was gone, but had asked no one else to help. ‘I can manage,’ he told me. ‘Everything’s dead anyway. Only the cows to do.’
<name>Carol</name>	Carol	Kerrin	I was glad when the fern died and we didn’t have to see [MASK] going through with her farce of caring about it every night. It’s hard to watch people acting fools. (Harder still to watch her dumping out quarts of water on the fern.)
<name>we</name>	we	Merle	In the gradual ceasing of sound we heard the cocks crow with a fresh eerie shrillness, startling as from another world. We beat out the last flames and [MASK] covered a smouldering post with earth. The wires lay down across the field with the charred posts left at intervals like burned crows caught between the barbs.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Merle	We planned the party ourselves, how it was to be and what was to be made, and I taught [MASK] a long poem to say, and kept her in the chicken house for an hour a day sitting on the bran bin to recite it off by heart.
<name>the organist</name>	the organist	Merle	More now than ever, sitting there listening to [MASK] play and remembering that other Sunday, I wanted to know the reasons. And, more than that, wanted something outside myself. But a faith that would/fr life, not just hide it.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Grant	We went out after her then, [MASK] halfdragging me over the stones. I was too tired to think or care, but knew that there was this to be done and followed him, feeling his heavy hand more than either the sun or fear.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Merle	[MASK] kept asking. ‘Why’re we different than other people?’ But dust came up in hot clouds around us, and the sun was a drying fire, and nobody wanted to answer her. Nor would we have known what the answer was.
<name>Gertrude</name>	Gertrude	Grant	‘A man can’t afford to give when nobody gives him back. You can’t work without profit when nobody round you does. I’d give for no cost if I could get back for nothing.’ ‘Somebody’s got to begin,’ [MASK] said.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Merle	He looked at her and laughed, and then asked why she didn’t go in and start cooking. ‘You’ve worked for nothing,’ [MASK] told him, ‘if that’s why you wanted to help.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Merle	She was afraid he would steal or murder us, I guess. And so was I. We went back and crept down in the cellar and snatched some potatoes up. [MASK] had carrots and an apple. We climbed the fence and ran out across the field.
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Merle	Only scrub-pasture and timber lay between us and the road, and it was like ploughing rock to make a furrow. The underbrush dry as sand. ‘What do they want a new road for?’ [MASK] said. ‘Wasn’t the old one good enough?
<name>rat</name>	rat	Kerrin	Rain made a slow and washing sound on the window glass, and we heard a small rustle of mice. We felt tired and sick, but out here in the dark with only mice sounds and the slide of rain things seemed less terrible and vile. ‘Where do you think that [MASK] went?’
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Thoreau	Intervals and things stolen between - between what? - those things which are necessary to make life endurable? - fed, washed, and clothed, to enjoy the time which is not washing and cooking and clothing. . . . [MASK] was right.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Christian	Does too-great fear annul itself? Too much sickness cancel pain? ... An awful patience seemed to come over us, a numbness that was in itself a kind of death. [MASK] looked like a ragged skeleton in the moonlight, his eyes and cheek-bones dim white marks.
<name>him</name>	him	Grant	‘You go back,’ I told [MASK]. There wasn’t anything he could do, - no way for anyone to get between her and the suffering, and there was the fire coming on nearer all the time.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Max	[MASK] came along, grumbling and swearing in a loud mutter, and rubbing his itching eyes until they were raw. We had no feeling of triumph or success; only of tiredness and the awful, unnecessary waste. It had cost too much to win.
<name>she</name>	she	Kerrin	Nothing that wouldn’t bear noon sun on it. What was it to him that [MASK] got more irrational all the time? What was our mortgage to him? . . . This sense of impermanence and waiting? . . . Love’s unintentional hate?
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Grant	‘What did you do to get words inside it?’ ‘Shoved him into the truck and took him along,’ [MASK] said. He laughed, but looked tired and worried. ‘How’s all this going to end?’
<name>Whit</name>	Whit	Braille	He pointed around at the farm. ‘They don’t bring in what they cost!’ ‘You want’m, don’t you?’ [MASK] asked. ‘Ain’t this where you want to live? - Well, you got to pay for it then.’
<name>someone</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	someone (There is not enough information in the passage to determine a specific name.)	Merle	But even though I despised myself, it seemed that earth was no less beautiful or less given to me in my littleness than to [MASK] who had twice as much of good in her. And it seemed unjust and strange, but would probably balance up some day.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Grant	Shout or curse. His silence seemed like a wall against some rising flood. Because I was quiet and dull I noticed [MASK] more than the others did, and sometimes even in the middle of talking he would seem years away from us and gone into himself.
<name>John</name>	John	Merle	[MASK] mumbled. ‘This pot won’t fill him as high as his heel, let alone the rest. Men that high ought to learn to eat something cheaper, something a person could buy by the ton or sack, like cobs or hay.
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Marget	- ‘[MASK], isn’t there anything 1 can do? It’s like being half-crucified sometimes!’ How could I tell him who knew one answer only? Outside was the hot windless air, the dead elm branch against the sky, and the point of a buzzard drifting.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Merle	[MASK] turned her red face away from the boiling carrots. ‘What’s the matter?’ she asked, but seemed to know without being told. She shook the pot fiercely over the flame and slammed the lid. ‘Potatoes were bad that year.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Merle	There’s a kind of haze, anyway, I noticed—’ I knew it was only dust and so did he, but my mind was too shrunk to think of an answer, and he’d given up waiting for me to talk hack the way [MASK] did, and pretended he wanted none.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Grant	There’s a mild irony in being wiser than sheep, at least.’ *'There’s more than that to it, [MASK],’ I said. ‘More for you, anyway—’ It seemed an empty and obvious thing to say.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kerrin	Maybe I’m not going back a while!’ She kept breaking twigs in her skinny hands. ‘[MASK],’ I said like a pompous fool, ‘it isn’t always the things we want that are given us to do.’
<name>she</name>	she	Merle	She slammed the door and rushed out in the dark, though it was beginning to rain and a cold wind had come up. I stood there dumb, not knowing what to do or say, and [MASK] kept on crying.
<name>his father</name>	his father	Merle	And he wanted time to look around and be still. He loved the land in a proud, owned way, - only because it was his, and for what it would mean to us; not in the way that [MASK] and I did, and still do.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Braille	‘I never would have believed we owned so much. It makes a man count his blessings!’ [MASK] grinned and drove off. He seemed a kind enough man. Not steel. Not a man intended to leave a trail of sick hate wherever he went.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Merle	[MASK] never complained about this and, re-reading all of the old books, pretended to get more out of the fourth time than the third. Only once I heard her break out in exasperation, throwing away some grease-marked history of early battles.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Grant	It was hard to see her around because of feeling pity; she looked like a thing scratched down to bone, moved by a kind of sourceless energy, not of her own strength any more. [MASK] was patient with her in those days, more than ever before.
<name>Black</name>	Black	Hay	The boy looked scared and sullen, and didn’t seem to believe her. ‘Your uncle’s dead,’ she told him. ‘[MASK]-hoist knocked him off.’ She seemed almost to take a malicious delight in telling it to him that way.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Merle	He was yellow and liver-spotted and looked as though newly come out of a cellar’s dark. ‘Where’s your Dad gone to, girls?’ he said. He had a tired and unpleasant voice. I pointed back to the barn, and [MASK] stared.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Kerrin	If she went back in secret to this woman-place he did not know it, because marriage was to her a thing of which mighty few men are worthy - a religion and long giving. He seemed not to see or to have forgotten [MASK], might not have noticed her at all
<name>existentialism</name>	existentialism	Kerrin	the moment of realization that there are some things that are neither bad nor good, nor ever to be classified . . . the strangeness that [MASK] had . . . things that like shards of a meteorite imply the presence of worlds beyond comprehension or understanding.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grant	‘Always some other time! Always somebody else! - Ain’t there no now for us?’ [MASK] piled up the cans and shut the gate. ‘First plough-ing’s hardest,’ he said. ‘Busts up the share sometimes.
<name>Mr. Turner</name>	Mr. Turner	Turner	‘We can’t make any rent-payments ovah to [MASK]’s. We got to pay him in cash and half the crop, and we ain’t got any cash this yeah. - He ain’t goin’ to root us out, though!
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Merle	Our life seemed only a long waiting for her to get well - a vacuum in which we moved and did things, but nothing was the same. I felt lost and [MASK] seemed suddenly-grown older, as if waked from a living sleep.
<name>Crooks</name>	Crooks	Grant	‘Maybe you could get by all right,’ he told [MASK], - ‘you ain’t a nigger. You don’t have a wife and seven children. A nigger can’t wait and see what’ll happen. He knows!'
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Ramsey	“A white man would have managed.” Then I got mad and asked it he thought being niggers kept rain off their land, hut he only grinned. Said he needed the rent and was “making plans.” [MASK] is not included in these “plans.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grant	It was dark and crumbling, and she ate a sliver herself, absently, licking the crumbs from her palm, then handed some over to [MASK], looking at him, her eyes impersonal and yet with a kind of pity.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Merle	He was embarrassed, we could see, but I noticed he had a quiet way of standing, not stiff and awkward like most men ill at ease. ‘He was scared and wanting to go,’ [MASK] said afterward. ‘I could see him get red under all his tan.’
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Grant	But he looked almost eager instead of grim. 13 I CAME to wonder how we had gotten along alone in the days before [MASK] had come. He roomed with us and ate all his meals here, too, going back to his father’s land some- times on Sundays.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kerrin	She was anxious and uneasy and dreaded these times more than any snake or ghost. ‘We ought to be going back,’ she said. ‘Maybe it’s later than the dishes—’ [MASK] looked angry and defiant. ‘What if it is?
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Grant	I came to see more clearly after one night when [MASK] and I had gone up to the north pasture together, hunting his watch that he’d lost near the plough. The stars were windy and brilliant, and one enormous planet burned down along the west.
<name>Miss Rachel</name>	Miss Rachel	Kerrin	[MASK] shouted. ‘I suppose that you think I stole or borrowed!’ She got up and glared down on me. She was dark all over her long thin face, and I think she hoped that I did suspect her - she wanted to feel accused of dark and secret things.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Grant	Good mulch for a cornfield, [MASK] had said of him once. Things happened suddenly. Not when we fear or pray for them most, but not without cause or link somewhere if we could trace the invisible design. But was this so, after all?
<name>The daughter</name>	The daughter	Kerrin	‘You help your mother.’ He hired a man to work for a while and [MASK] was angry, felt things pounding in her, impotent and suppressed, and was sullen and lowering as the young bulls are. ‘He thinks I can’t do anything!’
<name>Joads</name>	Joads	Merle	Acres of wild phlox turned to corn. There was no use to say anything. Not even [MASK] did any more. Four trees came down, two pin-oaks and some sycamores, and the oaks had a queer and oily smell. No peaches this year.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Merle	‘We get more and somebody else pays more. Where’s the sense in that?’ ‘There isn’t any,’ [MASK] said. ‘But we have to think of ourselves now. Somebody has to pay.’ ‘What’ll I do with a hundred gallons?’
<name>Mrs. Hargrove</name>	Mrs. Hargrove	Lena	I picked nine boxes of lima-beans and have them all ready and these people call up and ask for them and [MASK] says no, she ain’t time to take them in, she’s got her washing to do,
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Merle	He ate two pieces, and I could not help thinking of how the molasses was nearly gone already, and only a little sugar left, and I hated him for eating our food. ‘Thanks,’ he said to [MASK], got up and wiped his mouth.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Merle	‘A person gets worn out heaving the shocks around to find any ears,’ [MASK] said. ‘And the ears aren’t fit for much but cob-houses. - Black smut and corn-boils. We didn’t dare look what we dumped to the steers.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Grant	She snapped it at him, but not either angry or believing what she said. And I saw [MASK] watching her when she went away, - a sort of pleased look on his tired face. I went back up to the pasture with him that afternoon.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Grant	[MASK] came out, still strapping his clothes around him; he was grim and tired-looking, and his hair ragged. We could see the red light now, a wide wash of it along the field-edge, and the acrid smoke hot along the air.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Merle	[MASK] had hated the mortgage, but never feared it, even though loving the place as much, if not more, than I did. I thought that if ever we rid ourselves of the debt, it would be through her stubbornness and hate.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	One	They stopped at the gate, sweat running down off the mules’ hide, and the hair wet-black on their faces under the socket hollows. [MASK] had a harness-sore big as a hand across his rump, black on the edge but red where the flies were.
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Kkrrin	He left at last, and by the time he was gone there was the milking to start again, and supper still to be gotten; and there was relief in doing these stale and familiar things. 18 [MASK] WAS buried up in the old Haldmarne lot.
<name>George</name>	George	Merle	I wish we were hard-mouthed, chary of praise, and all our lives saying only the things we think are so. In this way only can we have values or standards of any sort. [MASK] came near to this, not intentionally but by being bom honest.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Merle	[MASK] fell twice and got her face all smeared. She was crying, and lost her breath to call. We saw the man then, passing around where the road-turn was, talking and swearing to himself, and the wind-twitched overcoat pulled tight around what was left of him.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Merle	He never spoke of himself except when I asked him things. He remembered coming that time for the horse when [MASK] met him out in the yard. She was red and stumpy, he said, and her hair was fuzzy behind.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Grant	There wasn’t much else to think of then. [MASK] was older than I had thought he would be, and seemed at first a cragged and strange-looking man. He was tall and thin and we found ourselves staring up at his face like children.
<name>Marian</name>	Marian	Kerrin	We came down into the kitchen and flapped their dampness in front of the fire, and [MASK] sat at the table without saying anything, and the hay still messed in her hair. Her legs were wet and goose-fleshed from walking up in the grass.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Merle	Three years of drouth never come together, and I’ve got a good man to help me now!’ ‘Drink him a toast in water,’ [MASK] said. ‘That’s the greatest thing you could honor with, these days.’
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Merle	‘What’s the matter?’ [MASK] wanted to know; and I think she could see the thoughts as though written plain on my broad smooth face, because she stood there chewing a twig, and all the inside light was gone out of her own.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Merle	It had come up fast and still, no warning except the quiet, and we stood there staring like blocks of stone. Then [MASK] shouted, ‘It’s here!’ and ran out fast like a crazy person, and we saw stabs of lightning all through the black upboiling mass.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Kerrin	‘He’s sick.’ He put the milk down slopping over the floor, and looked at [MASK]. He started to say something, but only got red and tight and turned around in a helpless, exasperated way.
<name>Granny</name>	Granny	Kerrin	[MASK] wouldn’t tell us what it was she was going to do, but went off each day by herself in the woods. ‘It’s going to be good,’ was all she’d say. ‘You-all will be shamed.’
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Grant	- ‘What’s the matter?’ she started to say. ‘- You in a rush for the food?’ - but managed to smear it over. [MASK] pulled out three shirts at once and twisted them all together. Squashed the buttons in half.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Grant	I couldn’t think of much else, though, but the relief of getting home and lying in bed asleep. Unsaddling the horse was effort to even think about, and I tried to smother the tiredness with pretending that [MASK] might wait up and do it for me.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Merle	‘Only maybe they’ve got a new way of saying it now.’ ‘A new way might help some,’ [MASK] had answered. She’d looked more tired than I’d ever seen her, and did not pick up the book or smile.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Kerrin	[MASK] was beautiful in a dark, odd way, and made with a brown cold skin tight-stretched, and wild colty eyes. She would stand sometimes turning her face before the mirror, or spread her hands out through her hair that was more like a thick red light than anything real.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Grant	Given him one for me. Hit him so hard he’d never have bounced back up again.’ 'He wouldn’t have bounced,’ [MASK] muttered sourly. 'I le’d have crumpled up into dust. Dry rot.’
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Grant	Everyone’s got to do it. It ain’t possible to give away milk and hogs and time when you have to pay plough and oil - and a man to help!’ ‘It’s about what you’re doing, anyway,’ [MASK] said.
