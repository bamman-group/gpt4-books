<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Painters	[MASK] were captivated by the elegant shape of her head, around which she wore her chestnut hair in a coronet, and there were a dozen portraits of her, and hundreds of drawings hanging in the big bedroom where she had died and which now had been made into a sort of shrine for her.
<name>Mrs. Hopewell</name>	Mrs. Hopewell	Daisy	But gradually the storm begins to lull. “You’re sure you’ve got your ticket?” says [MASK]. “You’ll surely be able to get a roomette once you’re on.” “I don’t know about that,” I say.
<name>Aunt Sally</name>	Aunt Sally	Gran	He steered clear of [MASK]’s radishes and lettuce after she had several times given him a brisk comeuppance with a strap across the rump, and he soon left off chewing shoes and the laundry on the line, and he outgrew his babyish whining.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Lucy	You want to have an affair with the sky.” “Don’t be maudlin, [MASK],” said her husband. “And above all, don’t be inaccurate.” He was a finicking young cub who had been saying things like this all weekend.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Emily	Why, [MASK], do you realize that if it hadn’t of been for you, we might not have got rid of those birds till they’d set up shop and done a whole lot of mischief?” “Really?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Belle	She had no intention of answering it, although [MASK] had gone out to shop and the by-the-day girl had gone home. But she said to herself, “Who is it? Who are they that they can’t knock out loud like a Christian?
<name>Me</name>	Me	Derelict	Attorney for the prosecution, she articulated each resounding syllable over the bullfrog voices of the bass fiddles and leaned forward affirmatively in her wheelchair. “But are the public to be treated like so much flotsam and jetsam? [MASK], am I? Guilty of leprosy or vagabondage?
<name>Dr. Strauss</name>	Dr. Strauss	Ada	I was incensed. “He was not unclean! He washed himself exactly like a cat!” I screamed. “She said he was asleep for thirty months,” said [MASK]. “Ask her how he could wash in his sleep.”
<name>me</name>	me	Opal	“But first,” he said, “tell [MASK] and I a little something about yourself, sister." He took a black notebook out of the pocket of his black coat and took a stubby pencil out of his hatband, licked it, and began to ask me questions.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Rose	His breathing was a little heavy and the parrot, eyeing [MASK] in the twilight of the hall, gave forth a glottal giggle full of wisdom. All the low furniture in the invalid woman’s room was painted white except for the narrow bed, which was blackish-brown and looked like a catafalque.
<name>the doll hospital</name>	the doll hospital	Angelo	Today I hate all men. “What am I going to do? What can I do? I’m taking her this afternoon to [MASK] to see what he can salvage out of the scraps that are left. I’ll get her a new doll—one with short hair.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Victoria	Let’s keep this luxury item under our hats.” And [MASK], fingering the leather patch on his elbow as if it were the most beloved object in the world, replied: “I don’t think it has any consumer value at all.”
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Opal	When to these hard, interesting questions I replied that I did not know, [MASK] left off her humming and said, “Amen.” When he had got from me all the data he wanted, he said, “I bet you this here town is a candidate for brimstone.
<name>Ned</name>	Ned	Hannah	The picture, when it was finished, was going to hang in the drawing room over an heirloom lowboy, where now there hung a pair of crossed epees, used by [MASK]’s father and his adversary in a jaunty, bloody Studentenmensur at Freiburg the year he went abroad to learn German.
<name>Miss Daisy</name>	Miss Daisy	Angelica	Poor soull Her person was her personality. Often, when the doctor had finished his rounds, he took [MASK] driving in the pretty countryside; she was veiled against the ravages of the sun and, he observed, she wore gloves.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Ramona	I’d never have bought you all that gear if I had known.” [MASK] laughed lightly. They approached the garden gate of a tall yellow house, and she said, “This is where I live. Want to come in and have a glass of kirsch?”
<name>partner</name>	partner	Emily	Just kindly allow me to impound this so-called medicine and then you shove. What kind of a bill of goods were they trying to sell you, [MASK], kid?” The deputy said, “That’s another of their lines.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Laura	I could hear whispers at the other end, and finally [MASK] said, “Very well, although it will inconvenience us,” and then she warned, “If you are late, my mother will come home. I suppose you don’t want her to know?”
<name>George</name>	George	Daniel	Hardly a day passed that they did not bicker over something; they might dispute a question of fact, argue a matter of taste, catch each other out in an inaccuracy, and every quarrel ended with [MASK]’s saying to her, “Why don’t you leave me alone?”
<name>Main Street</name>	Main Street	Gran	There, somehow, in the care- free disorder, his clothes did not look especially strange, but on the streets of the town, in the barbershop or the post office or on [MASK]’s path, they were fantastic.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Gerlash	You can't tell me your mammy and pappy are so mean that they wouldn’t give their little girl a quarter for [MASK] on the Bible. Why don’t you skedaddle over to home and get the small sum of twenty-five cents off your Christian ma?”
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Margaret	“If I went and yodeled under his window, do you think he might succumb?” The odious image made [MASK]’s “Oh, no!” come out like a petition. She said, “He must get this off in the mail tomorrow.”
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Rose	Despite a heritage of headlong impulse and her practice of setting forth before the signal was given. [MASK] made no move to further her acquaintance with the man and, indeed, she took pains never to see him out of his context.
<name>her dog</name>	her dog	Caesar	She obeyed, that is, in part; she put the muzzle on [MASK] for a few hours a day, usually early in the morning when the traffic was light and before the deliveries had started, but the rest of the time his powerful jaws and dazzling white saber teeth were free and snapping.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Daniel	At these times, she was so separated from the world, so far removed from his touch and his voice, so solitary, that she would have sued a stranger for companionship. [MASK] slept deeply, having no guilt to make him toss.
<name>she</name>	she	Sue	There were droplets of sweat on her forehead and her hands were shaking, but nothing else about her showed that she had gone to pieces earlier or that she was deep, deeper by far than anyone else [MASK] had ever known.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Eisenburg	The Metropolitan boys, who, however bright they were, would be boys, now caused some steely article of dress to clank, and she instantly quit the balcony, as if this unseemly noise would attract the crowd’s attention and bring everyone, including [MASK], to see what had happened.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Stella	I myself once made a ghastly slip and said something to [MASK] about “the five-and-dime.” “The hve-a.nd-d.ime!” she exclaimed. “Where’d you get that kind of talk? Do you by any chance have reference to the ten-cent store?”
<name>her face</name>	her face	Rose	He added in an exasperated aside, “Not that it matters a hoot in hell what kind of any old thing it is.” The invalid covered [MASK] with an ambiguous glance and said, “I her.” “I her,” repeated her son.
<name>Fluffy</name>	Fluffy	Bow	I thought, more immediately, of shaving off my hair by way of expiation. When I got to the house, I scooped up [MASK], the cat, from the rocking chair where she was sleeping, and went to my bed- room.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Rose	[MASK]. Won’t you come again?” “I’ll try,” she said without any pity at all. “When?” “I don’t know.” “Tomorrow? Oh, no, tomorrow we meet in the library, don’t we?
<name>Old Dan</name>	Old Dan	Caesar	I don’t believe it!’’ The very next day, again at morbid, heavy sunset, [MASK] died in violent convulsions, knocking down two tall hollyhocks in his throes. Long after his heart had stopped, his right hind leg continued to jerk in aimless reflex.
<name>Mrs. Kawasaki</name>	Mrs. Kawasaki	Hana	Or suddenly I am standing beside [MASK], the Japanese washerwoman, as she lifts the lid of a trunk: the smell of camphor balls is strong as she holds up my mother’s pin-striped hobble skirt. But I remember nothing of the house.
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Rose	“The tray goes here/’ he said, “and you can pour.” And then he left the room, walking out backwards to unnerve her all the more. The ten minutes he was gone were for [MASK] a bizarre and separate experience.
<name>she</name>	she	Polly	“He could sell it,” said her indomitable aunt. “He could rent it,” said her practical uncle. “That would give you additional revenue.” The air was close; it was like the dead of night in a sealed room and [MASK] wanted to cry for help.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Francis	“And [MASK] and I will not last long. You’ll only be burdened and bored with us a little while longer.” "We have meant to reward you liberally for your loyalty,” said her uncle. “The houses will be yours when we join our ancestors.”
<name>uncertain</name>	uncertain	Onslager	Her lover’s face, on the other hand, was—[MASK] wanted to say “writhing,” and the long fingers of the hand that pressed against her back were splayed out and rigid, looking grafted onto the sunny flesh beneath the diaphanous blue stuff of her dress.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Robertson	“Get me?” he cried. The Captain laughed and slapped his leg. “The whole thing’s a lie, that’s what it is, you outlaw!” “It’s a lie if the gospel truth’s a lie,” said [MASK].
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Angelica	Being beautiful is no easy matter.” This woman was highly paid, but she was a kind woman, too, and she meant what she said. It was [MASK]’s hands that at last, inexorably, began to tell the time.
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Waldo	Not that the cuisine is not to my liking. But I am rather tied here to my poor sick mother. That is to say, I generally dine en famille.” A note of woe came into his voice: “En famille with [MASK].”
<name>John</name>	John	Marten	He wrote, “Have you heard from [MASK]?” She nodded, and closed her eyes in a dragging weariness. “He has written me volumes,” she said. “In the first place, he doesn’t believe that I am deaf but thinks it’s an act.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Daniel	Once when [MASK], in a rare mood, kissed her, she drew back involuntarily and he said gently, “I wish I knew what you had done, poor dear.” He looked as if for written words in her face.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Belle	“Don’t pretend you know nothing about it, my good woman. Why did you do it. [MASK]? Have you no respect for other people’s property? Do you think I can have my bedroom repapered every week or so merely for the sake of your vulgar whims?”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Hannah	[MASK] went into the den and kneeled on the window seat to watch the snow settling deeply on the branches of the trees. “I love you, snow,” she said. It fell like sleep. The Captain's Gift
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Opal	Oh, sister, may you be forgiven on the Day of Judgmentl” “Whyn’t you go get us some eats?” said [MASK], cajoling. “If you get us some eats, we won’t come calling. If we come calling, like as not we’ll spend the night.”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Rose	He was such a terrible mixture of unattractive qualities that she did not know how his face managed to be so aristocratically handsome. They were at the door now and she put her hand out toward the knob, but he was ahead of her. “Permit me, [MASK],” he said.
<name>her hearing</name>	her hearing	Handel	There is a note of gaiety in her letters—she is almost jocose. For example, in the last one she said that although she had lost [MASK] and music boxes and the purring of my Siamese, she had gained a valuable immunity to the voices of professional Irishmen.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Abby	Thus, [MASK] had come to belong to that group who have spent their lives leaning on someone—or being leaned on by—a father, a mother, a husband; and who, when the casket is closed or the divorce decree is final, find that they are waifs.
<name>James</name>	James	Homer	Perhaps it was not a squirrel but was a loose branch blowing in the wind: I shall speak severely to [MASK]. If he calls himself my yard-man, he can attend to these details. Perhaps it was a dog of the neighborhood, foolishly thumping his tail against the door.
<name>he</name>	he	Rob	He was horrid on Monday. He called me an opportunist and a brood mare. It depresses me that [MASK], who is so intuitive about most things, can’t see that I am the victim, that my values have been impugned. Today I hate all men.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Ramona	She looked at that ethereal face again, and this time had no doubt that it had once belonged to [MASK]. No wonder the loss of it had left her heartbrokenl She sighed to think of her friend’s desperate fabrication.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Rose	Upstairs there are four bedrooms besides yours truly’s. Linen closet, of course, and ample attic space.” They paused at a door and he said, secretly as if the parrot were eavesdropping, “I have seen you in the library, you know. [MASK].”
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Opal	This book is offered for a limited time only.” “I can’t get a quarter,” I said. “I already owe her twenty cents.” “What’re you going to have for supper?” asked [MASK] avidly.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Belle	He had come across the lawn, making his own path, deliberately to spoil the looks of the clean, unmarked snow, when he could much more easily have walked in [MASK]’s footprints. He opened the storm door without asking leave and he said, “Will you buy this?”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Bernice	“I tell you, [MASK], that’s me arrayed in all my glory. My visitors will bear witness. Have you observed, ladies, the costume I wear to my daily Charity Ball? Do you like these rambuctious babies playing on the ground?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Sue	Several times she failed to appear at lunch, and when [MASK], in a friendly way, asked for an explanation, she snapped, “None of your business. What do you think you are? My nurse?”
<name>the protagonist</name>	the protagonist	Lottie	The old man gave her a condescending look and said, “That so? But I don’t suppose yours are of a political nature." He bent his gaze again to the choice of adhesives. This first undertaking was duck soup for [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Malcolm	They gasped and gaped when they saw the civic-minded Swede and sotto voce [MASK] said: “I’ll kill him.” “My stars!” cried the sociologist. “Of all places to run into a couple of people I know!
<name>Bobo</name>	Bobo	Laddy	He was the closest thing to a maniac we had ever seen. So we did not tell him about [MASK]; what he did not know would not hurt him, although it was hurting us, throbbing in us like a great, bleating wound.
<name>June</name>	June	Lottie	“My mother’s teeth grow wrong way to,” said [MASK], and showed me what she meant: the lower teeth were in front of the upper ones. “That so-called trolley car takes its own sweet time. This town is blah.”
<name>Lady Bruton</name>	Lady Bruton	Evan	The double doors to the garden were open to admit the moonlight and the summer breeze, and now and again, in the course of the meal, [MASK] had glanced out and had seen luminous nicotiana and delphiniums growing profusely beside a high stone wall.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	George	“Sakes!” “And I was afraid he had learned some of the tricks of his Uncle [MASK]’s business before he came to us,” said the nun, “although he did not seem to be a morbid child.”
<name>Hachi</name>	Hachi	Laddy	After that first night, [MASK] slept in our room, receiving from us, all through our delighted, sleepless nights, pats and embraces and kisses and whispers. He was our baby, our best friend, the smartest, prettiest, nicest dog in the entire wide world.
<name>Miss Bates</name>	Miss Bates	Bea	I don’t know what she said in it, though I suppose she told him she didn’t want to be a burden, something like that—much more gracefully, of course, since [MASK] is the soul of courtesy.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	May	In early spring, when the whippoorwills begged in the cattails and the marsh reeds, and the northern lights patinated the lake and the tidal river, and the stars were large, and the huge vine of Dutchman’s-pipe had started to leaf out, [MASK] went to bed late.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Milton	“I know, [MASK]. But it’s a funny thing. Works backward with some people, you might say. Some way, as you get older . . . I don’t know. I’m just thinking the way I used to be.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Abby	The kiss in the garden had not been repeated, but their concord had deepened and their joy in each other’s society had been so accelerated that [MASK] lived in a state of heady exultation. She was, indeed, so happy that there came moments when she regretted that the time was running out
<name>John</name>	John	Jennie	“I disapprove too much.” "But you don’t disapprove of the medical people,” persisted [MASK]. “Why fly in the face of their prescription?” “Because ... I couldn’t do it.
<name>manure</name>	manure	Neccos	“She likes either geraniums or cut flowers. She has forgotten the names of all the others.” Now that she was so close to him she discovered that it was he who smelled of [MASK] and that actually the hall smelled of ordure.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Maggie	You might have enjoyed flying one of my gliders later on.” At this hideous proposal, poor [MASK]’s butterfingers dropped the glass they were holding and wine went all over the priceless damask; the accident was Olympianly disregarded except by the butler, who scowled blackly.
<name>Beth</name>	Beth	Laura	“Hear ye! Hear ye!” “Yes?” said [MASK], preoccupied. She had lifted the lid of the tureen and to her sister said, "Do you think the insides of one bird will do?”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Rod	[MASK] and I danced once—speechless, except at the very end of the jukebox record, when he said, his lips in my hair, “I wish when we went out it would be snowing.” Snowingl He wanted the winter to come?
<name>Dr. Rieux</name>	Dr. Rieux	Jim	They were so startling that he could not help staring. The boy said, “The water’s poisonous. There’s an epidemic here.” [MASK] connected the poisonous water and the sickness in the dormitory with the boy’s red eyes, and he was motionless with fear.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Reddie	They did look awfully hungry, and I felt guilty the way I did when I was eating a sandwich and [MASK] was looking up at me like a martyr of old. * “Didn’t she say her daddy ran a grocery store?’’
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Rose	She turned it and heard a tinkle and instantly a voice very near her cried thinly, “Just a minute!” [MASK] could not tell where it came from but she waited in discomfort, feeling that she was being looked at from some vantage point no more than a foot away.
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Hannah	With her free hand, [MASK]’s mother lightly stroked the cat, who did not heed, and she lay back among her many pillows, listening to her sister but letting her eyes rove the room as if she were planning changes in its decoration.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Lily	Though [MASK] could not see them, since her bed impeded her view, she could hear them, ploddingly and erratically marking time on the linoleum-covered floor; the movement of the columnar neck also grew more pronounced and abruptly the small cropped head began to rotate quickly on its beautiful stem.
<name>her</name>	her	Angelica	They were old, I tell you. You can always tell by the hands.” Luckily for [MASK] and luckily for them, the cruel, green boys got off first; as she rode up the remaining way to her floor, she felt dizzy and hot.
<name>climbing</name>	climbing	Polly	They would breathe in the thin, lovely air of summits, and in their mouths there would not be a trace of the dust of the prairies where, as on a treadmill. Great-grandfather Bay’s oxen plodded on and on into eternity. The next days were for [MASK] at once harrowing and delightful.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Camilla	“This is overdoing things. It’s a cheap Chamber of Commerce trick.” “I know,” said [MASK]. “This is the most embarrassing, show-off place in the world. It’s like advertisements for summer resorts. Strictly corn.”
<name>Edith</name>	Edith	Angelica	There were some skeptics in [MASK]'s circle, but there were no cranks, and in speaking of her, using the superlatives that composed their native tongue, they called her adorable and indispensable, and they said that when she left them, the sun went down.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Ernie	It had been just one of those dates that fills an afternoon and comes to nothing, when you get along all right, but you aren’t much interested. Christmas, though, it gave her the creeps. All the time the girl talked, [MASK] stared at her, dumbstruck with rage.
<name>The Judge</name>	The Judge	Laura	I would not be touched by those slithering, opalescent intestines, and I shrank back and I cried out, “Will you listen to me? I told a lie!” [MASK]’s look roasted and froze me, sent me to jail, to hell; it drew and quartered me.
<name>John</name>	John	Daniel	For months she lived with her daily dishonor, rattled, ashamed, stubbornly clinging to her secret. But she grew more and more afraid when, oftener and oftener, [MASK] said, “Why do you lie to me? What does this mood of yours mean?”
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Hannah	And [MASK], spying and eavesdropping (a sin and she knew it), felt the ends of her cropped hair and ran a forefinger over her freshly combed boy’s cut—the subject of her mother’s conversation. Something like sleep touched her eyeballs, though this was early morning
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Sue	[MASK] could not hide her blushing face or put her fingers in her ears or close her eyes against the tortured countenance of that wretched butterball, who declared that she had often come within an ace of doing away with herself because she was so fat.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Hannah	Then he and her mother sat back in two scuffed leather armchairs drinking whisky and talking in a leisurely way, as if all the rest of the time in the world were theirs to enjoy in this relaxed geniality. [MASK] did not listen to them.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Daniel	“Oh, no, no! Oh, no, [MASK], it was hell!” “Then, by the same token, this must be heaven.” He smiled, the professor catching out a student in a fallacy. “Heaven.”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Daisy	“I’ve got asthma coming on.” We rush to the nearest exit of the city park and hail a cab, and, once inside it, [MASK] gives herself an injection of adrenalin and then leans back. We are heartbroken and infuriated, and we cannot speak.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Stella	When [MASK] had begun to grind her teeth in her first deep sleep, I took twenty cents away from the poor widow, whoever she was (the owner of the kitchen sink, no doubt), for the trolley fare, and secreted it and the remaining three pennies in the pocket of my middy.
<name>She</name>	She	Lily	[MASK] did not know the word but she nodded reassuringly to her cousin, whose pellucid blue eyes were grave. She suddenly felt much younger than she was and her whisper was a whimper when she said, “May I go when you do?”
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Angelica	Or could he perhaps be one of those glittering Eastern rulers who* contrived to take an incognito holiday from their riches and their dominions but could not, because of law and tradition, ever introduce [MASK] into their courts?
<name>Mrs. Prothero</name>	Mrs. Prothero	Daisy	And they are watching my sister and me, two middle-aged women, as we sit on a bench between the exhibits, eating popcorn, growing thirsty. We are thoughtful. A chance remark of [MASK]’s a few minutes before has turned us to memory and meditation.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Jim	At the edge of the lawn beyond all the buildings, [MASK] saw a line of trees, the sort that follow a riverbank, and he thought that when it got dark, that was where he would go. But he was afraid, and even though it was hot and still here
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Onslager	; the tea parties to which one went obediently to placate old belles who had lost their looks and their husbands and the roles that, at their first assembly, they had assumed they would play forever. Well-mannered and patient, [MASK] did his duty suavely, and he was seldom thrilled.
<name>Monkey</name>	Monkey	Shannon	His hat was the silliest of all, because it was a derby three sizes too big. And as if [MASK], too, was a part of his funny-paper costume, the elder capuchin rode on his shoulder, tightly embracing his thin red neck.
<name>Pearl</name>	Pearl	Opal	[MASK], here, had got the word the day she was born, and by the time she was five and a half years old she could preach to a fare-thee-well against the Catholics and the Wets.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Fred	As though to fend off the sight of this second catastrophe, she lifted her arm, and, as she did so, saw that, just as [MASK]’s had been, its size was doubled and its joints were caricatured.
<name>she</name>	she	Daniel	Now, schooled by silence and indifference, she was immune to disrepair and to the damage done by the wind and snow, and she looked, as [MASK] did, without dislike upon the old and nasty wallpaper and upon the shabby kitchen floor.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Beatrice	But [MASK], ignoring him, chose another chair. The cats, still flirting with her, romped at her feet; one of them pretended to find a sporting prey between her instep and her heel, and he pounced and buck-jumped silently, his tail a fast, fierce whip.
