<name>Dan Brown</name>	Dan Brown	Teabing	[MASK] was apparently on the side of making the documents public. “I simply provided history on the brotherhood and described them as a modern goddess worship society, keepers of the Grail, and guardians of ancient documents.”
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Teabing	The keystone has been found. The question remained, of course, as to where the keystone would ultimately lead. Somewhere in the United Kingdom. Where exactly, [MASK] had no idea, but he was already tasting the glory.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Langdon	[MASK] had once worked on a series of Baconian manuscripts that contained epigraphical ciphers in which certain lines of code were clues as to how to decipher the other lines. “I’ve been thinking about the numbers all night. Sums, quotients, products.
<name>John</name>	John	Sophie	“You say keys are sometimes inherited?” [MASK] asked. “Indeed. Your key is like a Swiss numbered account, which are often willed through generations. On our gold accounts, the shortest safety-deposit box lease is fifty years. Paid in advance.
<name>Trevor</name>	Trevor	Langdon	[MASK] went on. “This icon is formally known as the blade, and it represents aggression and manhood. In fact, this exact phallus symbol is still used today on modem military uniforms to denote rank.” “Indeed.”
<name>John</name>	John	Langdon	[MASK] would never forget his reaction after waiting in line and finally viewing the priceless parchment. Utter letdown. The pages were unintelligible. Despite being beautifully preserved and written in an impeccably neat penmanship—crimson ink on cream paper—the codex looked like gibberish.
<name>that</name>	that	Langdon	Nestled snugly inside the box’s heavily padded interior of crimson silk lay an object [MASK] could not even begin to comprehend. Crafted of polished white marble, it was a stone cylinder approximately the dimensions of a tennis ball can.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Langdon	“In fact, virtually every Masonic temple in the world has two pillars like these.” [MASK] had already explained to her about the Templars’ powerful historic ties to the modern Masonic secret societies, whose primary degrees—Apprentice Freemason, Fellowcraft Freemason, and Master Mason—harked back to early Templar days.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Sophie	[MASK] wondered which of the fireside antiques she was supposed to sit on—the Renaissance velvet divan, the rustic eagle-claw rocker, or the pair of stone pews that looked like they’d been lifted from some Byzantine temple.
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Sophie	To say the letter leapt out at her was an un- derstatement. The letter was suddenly all [MASK] could see. Glaring in the center of the painting was the unquestionable outline of an enormous, flawlessly formed letter M. "A bit too perfect for coincidence, wouldn’t you say?”Teabing asked.
<name>Curator</name>	Curator	Sauniere	[MASK] closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret. The click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor. The curator’s eyes flew open. The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused.
<name>Bishop</name>	Bishop	Robert	Putting his ear to the wood, he listened. After a moment, he pulled back, a scheming look on his face as he pointed to the bulletin board. “[MASK], check the service schedule, will you? Who is presiding this week?”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Sophie	Her entrance, however, was met by an unexpected sound of muffled footsteps racing toward her from inside the chamber. There’s someone in here! A ghostly figure emerged suddenly from out of the reddish haze. [MASK] jumped back. “There you are!”
<name>Malcolm</name>	Malcolm	Langdon	“Yes, but my toga tore open when I fell, and I had to lie on stage for half an hour with my todger hanging out. Even so, I never moved a muscle. I was brilliant, I tell you.” [MASK] cringed.
<name>Mary Magdalene</name>	Mary Magdalene	Sophie	“A woman who carried with her a secret so powerful that, if revealed, it threatened to devastate the very foundation of Christianity1.” [MASK] looked overwhelmed. “Is this woman well known in history?” “Quite.”
<name>Jean-Luc</name>	Jean-Luc	Sophie	The tires howled as the taxi leapt forward, fishtailing wildly and sending the gathering crowd diving for cover. The woman with the cell phone leapt into the woods, only narrowly avoiding being run down. “Doucement1." [MASK] said, as the car lurched down the road.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sophie	At least none I’ve ever seen. Turning now and scanning the living room, [MASK]’s eyes fell to the only object in the entire house that seemed out of place—her grandfather’s favorite antique, a sprawling Aubusson tapestry.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Teabing	“Shall I show them out?” "Allow me.” [MASK] hobbled across the study, unlocked a set of wide glass doors, and swung them open onto a side lawn. “Please find your car, and leave.”
<name>Interpol</name>	Interpol	Collet	"Nothing new. Multiple sets matching those in the rest of the house.” “How about the prints on the cilice belt?” “Interpol is still working. I uploaded everything we found.” [MASK] motioned to two sealed evidence bags on the desk.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Langdon	In order to retrieve the documents from within the ruins, the Priory created a military arm— a group of nine knights called the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon.” [MASK] paused.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Fache	“The position simply reinforces the reference to the pentacle and sacred feminine.” [MASK]’s expression clouded. “I beg your pardon?” “Replication. Repeating a symbol is the simplest way to strengthen its meaning.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Gettum	“Very well,” [MASK] said, typing again. “I’ll play along. If this is a Grail-related issue, we should cross-reference against Grail keywords. I’ll add a proximity parameter and remove the title weighting.
<name>her brother</name>	her brother	Sophie	Through her tears, [MASK] nodded, standing. She did not know the young man’s face, but as they embraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursing through his veins . . . the blood she now understood they shared.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Teabing	With a nod, he relatched the box. The monk in back was moaning now, struggling against his trusses. Suddenly, he began kicking wildly. [MASK] spun around and aimed the pistol over the seat. “I can’t imagine your complaint, sir.
<name>Ender</name>	Ender	Langdon	“My point exactly,” [MASK] said. “Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality. And living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people.” “But it appears their reality is false.”
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Teabing	“Let them go,” the inspector ordered. “We received a bad tip.” [MASK]’s eyes were menacing even across the hangar. “You can expect a call from my lawyers. And for future reference, the French police cannot be trusted."
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Teabing	It’s hard to fathom.” [MASK] was silent a moment and then shook his head. “But it still makes no sense. Even if your grandfather were the Priory Grand Master and created the keystone himself, he would never tell you how to find it.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Langdon	Rather than a knight lying in the open air, this tomb was a sealed stone casket. The casket was trapezoidal, tapered at the feet, widening toward the top, with a peaked lid. “Why isn’t this knight shown?” [MASK] asked.
<name>The customer</name>	The customer	Sophie	“Of course, you can purchase much longer leases, but barring further arrangements, if there is no activity on an account for fifty years, the contents of that safe-deposit box are automatically destroyed. Shall I run through the process of accessing your box?” [MASK] nodded.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Sophie	that was, until she had seen the cryptex in this rosewood box. “He made me one of these when I was little,” [MASK] said. “But I’ve never seen one so ornate and large.”
<name>Vernet</name>	Vernet	Langdon	Gravel crunched beneath the tires. Why is he pulling over already? [MASK] wondered. Ver-net had told them he would take them well outside the city to safety. The truck decelerated to a crawl and made its way over unexpectedly rough terrain.
<name>Neal</name>	Neal	Langdon	“The account number,” he said, a familiar lopsided grin now crossing his face. “I’m pretty sure he left it for us after all.” "Where?” [MASK] produced the printout of the crime scene photo and spread it out on the coffee table.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fache	When a man is murdered by another man, I do not believe his final thoughts are to write an obscure spiritual statement that no one will understand. I believe he is thinking of one thing only.” [MASK]’s whispery voice sliced the air. “La vengeance.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Teabing	“A key to a church?” She drew a deep breath. “This key provides access to the keystone.” [MASK]’s head snapped up, his face wild with disbelief. “Impossible! What church did I miss?
<name>Templar</name>	Templar	Grail	[MASK] seekers, familiar with the Priory’s history of cryptic double-talk, had concluded la clef de voute was a literal keystone—an architectural wedge—an engraved, encrypted stone, inserted into a vaulted archway in a church. Beneath the sign of the Rose.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Sophie	An LCD screen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list was English. INSERT KEY. [MASK] took the gold laser-pocked key from her pocket and turned her attention back to the podium. Below the screen was a triangular hole.
<name>Leonardo</name>	Leonardo	Sophie	“His labors produced new sciences that incurred the wrath of the Church. And he was a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. What more could we want?” “What more?” [MASK] pointed to the poem. “How about a knight a Pope interred?
<name>Silas</name>	Silas	Silas	[MASK] lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. Dropping to his knees on the tile floor, he cried out for help. Everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino offering forth a bleeding clergyman.
<name>Morgan</name>	Morgan	Sophie	Knights who claimed to be “searching for the chalice” were speaking in code as a way to protect themselves from a Church that had subjugated women, banished the Goddess, burned nonbelievers, and forbidden the pagan reverence for the sacred feminine.” [MASK] shook her head.
<name>The Client</name>	The Client	Aringarosa	“Why should I wait?” "Indeed. We are very pleased with your expediency.” [MASK]’s eyes traveled the length of the long table to a large black briefcase. “Is that what I requested?” "It is.” The secretarius sounded uneasy.
<name>Bart</name>	Bart	Teabing	I’ve written several books on the topic.” “And I assume devout Christians send you hate mail on a daily basis?” “Why would they?” [MASK] countered. “The vast majority of educated Christians know the history of their faith.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Langdon	Could that explain—? “The identities of living Priory members are kept extremely secret,” [MASK] said, “but the P.S. and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child are proof. It could only have been related to the Priory.”
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Langdon	“The scrambled Fibonacci sequence is a clue,” [MASK] said, taking the printout. “The numbers are a hint as to how to decipher the rest of the message. He wrote the sequence out of order to tell us to apply the same concept to the text.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Sophie	“The letters RS. . . . do they mean anything else to you? Anything at all?” Afraid their voices might echo down the hall, [MASK] pulled him into the Salle des Etats and closed the enormous twin doors silently, sealing them inside.
<name>mentioned</name> (There is no proper name mentioned in the passage)	mentioned (There is no proper name mentioned in the passage)	Silas	He had not realized it at the time. The light came long after the thunder. His name was not [MASK] then, although he didn’t recall the name his parents had given him. He had left home when he was seven.
<name>Spider-Man</name>	Spider-Man	Fache	Wincing against the piercing shrill, he scanned the area. The stalls were empty. The bathroom deserted. [MASK]’s eyes moved immediately to the shattered window at the far end of the room. He ran to the opening and looked over the edge.
<name>Saunière</name>	Saunière	Sauniere	At least the truck would no longer look like a Fourth of July sparkler. He grabbed the bumper and began dragging it out of sight into the woods, wondering where they should go next. They had no idea how to open the cryptex, or why [MASK] had given it to them.
<name>Henri</name>	Henri	Grouard	the woman’s voice echoed across the room. [MASK] glanced over and stopped in his tracks. "Mon dieu, nonI” Through the reddish haze, he could see that the woman had actually lifted the large painting off its cables and propped it on the floor in front of her.
<name>Samantha</name>	Samantha	Sophie	How many Sundays did we spend doing the cryptograms and crosswords in the newspaper? At the age of twelve, [MASK] could finish the Le Monde crossword without any help, and her grandfather graduated her to crosswords in English, mathematical puzzles, and substitution ciphers.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sophie	[MASK] furrowed her brow. "That’s strange, because my grandfather always told me the Rose meant secrecy. He used to hang a rose on his office door at home when he was having a confidential phone call and didn’t want me to disturb him.
<name>Eowyn</name>	Eowyn	Sophie	Holding her breath, [MASK] inched down another few steps and crouched down to look. It took her several seconds to process what she was seeing. The room was a grotto—a coarse chamber that appeared to have been hollowed from the granite of the hillside.
<name>Indiana</name>	Indiana	Robert	“Fortunately, [MASK], your involvement turned out to be my saving grace. Rather than the keystone remaining locked in the depository bank forever, you extracted it and walked into my home.” Where else would I run?
<name>me</name>	me	Langdon	Lying supine on the floor, the carved, life-sized figures rested in peaceful poses. The knights were depicted wearing full armor, shields, and swords, and the tombs gave [MASK] the uneasy sensation that someone had snuck in and poured plaster over the knights while they were sleeping.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	It was how he activated the security system.” [MASK] looked back at the gate, trying to picture what had happened. “The curator was attacked in his office, fled into the Grand Gallery, and activated the security gate by pulling that painting from the wall.
<name>The customer</name>	The customer	Sophie	Because everything is automated, your privacy is guaranteed, even from the staff of this bank. If you need anything at all, simply press the call button on the table in the center of the room.” [MASK] was about to ask a question when a telephone rang.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Teabing	The convoy of police was still a good five hundred yards away as [MASK]’s Hawker taxied calmly into the private hangar and disappeared. When the cars finally arrived and skidded to a stop outside the gaping hangar door, the police poured out, guns drawn.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Vemet	[MASK] shrugged. “No clue. I’m a dock rat. They don’t let us anywhere near the clients. You need to go in and ask the front desk.” “Your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter.”
<name>Abigail</name>	Abigail	Langdon	“I don’t doubt you’ve seen them,” [MASK] said, “but it wasn’t necessarily here." She turned. “What do you mean?” “These two pillars are the most duplicated architectural structures in history. Replicas exist all over the world.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Langdon	Either way, if they passed another car, it would certainly draw attention. [MASK] made up his mind. “I’m going to see if I can bend this bumper back.” Pulling onto the shoulder, he brought the truck to a stop.
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Sauniere	Shivering, he pulled himself to his feet. I must find some way. . . . He was trapped inside the Grand Gallery, and there existed only one person on earth to whom he could pass the torch. [MASK] gazed up at the walls of his opulent prison.
<name>Claire</name>	Claire	Sophie	the guard’s voice yelled. [MASK] snatched the key from behind the painting and slipped it deep in her pocket along with the UV penlight. Peering out from be- hind the canvas, she could see the guard was still trying desperately to raise someone on the walkie-talkie.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Langdon	Two cryptexes. Everything in pairs. Double entendres. Male female. Black nested within white. [MASK] felt the web of symbolism stretching onward. White gives birth to black. Every man sprang from woman. White—female. Black—male.
<name>Grissom</name>	Grissom	Fache	“As you may know,” [MASK] said, his eyes luminescing in the violet glow, “police use black-light illumination to search crime scenes for blood and other forensic evidence. So you can imagine our surprise . . Abruptly, he pointed the light down at the corpse.
<name>Luc</name>	Luc	Teabing	“In addition to my grandfather, three other prominent Parisians were murdered today. All in similar ways. All looked like they had been interrogated.” [MASK]’s jaw fell. “And you think they were . . .”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sophie	Beyond that, I cannot get involved.” He stood up and hurried for the door. “Stay here. I’ll make arrangements and be right back.” "But the safe-deposit box,” [MASK] declared. “We can’t just leave.”
<name>Driver</name>	Driver	Sophie	Okay, [MASK], turn around very slowly. Putting the SmartCar in reverse, she performed a composed three-point turn and reversed her direction. As she drove away, she heard the sound of squealing tires behind them. Sirens blared to life.
<name>James</name>	James	Langdon	“I beg your pardon?” “She is lovely, no?” The agent motioned through the windshield toward the Eiffel Tower. “Have you mounted her?” [MASK] rolled his eyes. “No, I haven’t climbed the tower.”
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Napoleon	When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books—books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As [MASK] once said, ‘What is history, but a fable agreed upon?’ ” He smiled.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Remy	This is serious.” “So are my lawyers.” He scowled toward the monk in the rear of the plane. “That animal broke into my home and almost killed me. That is a fact, and [MASK] will corroborate.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Langdon	I came home a few days early.” “You want to tell me about it?” “I’d rather not.” She turned suddenly back to [MASK], her eyes welling with emotion. “I don’t know what I saw.”
<name>Sauniere</name>	Sauniere	Fache	Apparently, the curator’s private office had become DCPJ’s makeshift command post for the evening. "Messieurs," [MASK] called out, and the men turned. "Ne nous derangez pas sous aucun pretexte. Entendu?” Everyone inside the office nodded their understanding.
<name>we</name>	we	Sophie	The men wore long black tunics, and their masks were black. They looked like pieces in a giant chess set. Everyone in the circle rocked back and forth and chanted in reverence to something on the floor before them . . . something [MASK] could not see.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Faukman	I’m simply building on it. No book has yet explored the legend of the Holy Grail from a symbologic angle. The iconographic evidence I’m finding to support the theory is, well, staggeringly persuasive.” [MASK] was still staring at the list.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Vernet	Moments later, [MASK] felt a cloud of dirt and exhaust billowing over him. He heard the crunching of tires on gravel and sat up just in time to see the truck’s wide wheelbase fail to navigate a turn. There was a crash as the front bumper clipped a tree.
<name>Da Vinci</name>	Da Vinci	Collet	[MASK]’s eyes moved to the margins, where someone had scribbled notes on the photocopy in red felt-tipped marker. The notes were in French and appeared to be ideas outlining how best to insert a listening device into the knight.
<name>She</name>	She	Sophie	Running wildly, she darted back and forth across the house, from clue to clue, until at last she found a clue that directed her back to her own bedroom. [MASK] dashed up the stairs, rushed into her room, and stopped in her tracks.
<name>The Godfather</name>	The Godfather	Aringarosa	Tonight, these men sat in the shadows, as if they were somehow ashamed of what was about to transpire. [MASK] entered slowly, regally even. He could see the shapes of three men at a long table on the far side of the room.
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Fache	1 will see to it your wishes are carried out.” A heavy silence fell between them. On the television, a lean French police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling mansion. [MASK] saw who it was and turned his attention to the screen.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Langdon	We believe these numbers may be the key to who killed him. Maybe a telephone exchange or some kind of social identification. Do the numbers have any symbolic meaning to you?” [MASK] looked again at the digits, sensing it would take him hours to extract any symbolic meaning.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Fache	The center of the hallway was dotted by the occasional statue or colossal porcelain urn, which served as a tasteful divider and kept the flow of traffic moving down one wall and up the other. [MASK] was silent now, striding briskly up the right side of the corridor with his gaze dead ahead.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Sophie	Night was falling now, and the house exuded a warm and inviting aura. The smell of bread wafted through the opened screened door, and a golden light shone in the windows. As [MASK] approached, she could hear the quiet sounds of sobbing from within.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Edwards	I’m off my schedule, I am. Between you and me, the new medication gives me the tinkles. Thought I’d come over for a tune-up.” The policemen all exchanged looks. [MASK] winced. “Very good, sir.”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Teabing	“I’m not surprised,” [MASK] said. “The church is hidden now behind much larger buildings. Few people even know it’s there. Eerie old place. The architecture is pagan to the core.”
<name>She</name>	She	Sophie	He paused, a knot growing in his throat. “I’m sorry, I’m not very good at—” [MASK] reached out and placed her soft hand on the side of his face. Then, leaning forward, she kissed him tenderly on the cheek.
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Jacques	Her voice fell to a whisper. “Separating the family was the hardest thing we ever had to do. [MASK] and I saw each other only very infrequently, and always in the most secret of settings . . . under the protection of the Priory.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Langdon	He paused. “And what?” “And presenting to the world thousands of ancient documents as scientific evidence that the New Testament is false testimony.” “But you told me the New Testament is based on fabrications.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Fache	“The symbology and text don’t seem to coincide. I’m sorry I can’t be of more help.” “Perhaps this will clarify.” [MASK] backed away from the body and raised the black light again, letting the beam spread out in a wider angle.
<name>Fache</name>	Fache	Sophie	If we unlock the keystone, I am certain we will discover a map that indicates we have moved in the proper direction.” “You’re running a big risk,” [MASK] said, “by helping us. You won’t make any friends with the French police.”
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Man	The Bible did not fall magically from the clouds. [MASK] created it as a historical record of tumultuous times, and it has evolved through countless translations, additions, and revisions. History has never had a definitive version of the book.” “Okay.”
<name>Sophie</name>	Sophie	Robert	But I cannot see howl The stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike any he had ever felt. The Truth is right before your eyes, [MASK]. He knew not from where the epiphany came.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Sophie	For an instant he felt totally blind. Over where! As his vision cleared he saw [MASK]’s silhouette racing toward the center of the room and ducking out of sight behind the octagonal viewing bench. He was about to dash after her when a booming voice stopped him cold.
<name>Olivia</name>	Olivia	Gettum	Everyone loves a conspiracy.” She took off her glasses and eyed them. “I need more information.” In the silence, [MASK] sensed her guests’ desire for discretion was quickly being outweighed by their eagerness for a fast result.
<name>Tariq</name>	Tariq	Teabing	Someone he thought he could trust. Someone in his family.” [MASK] was pale. “But someone capable of such an attack ... of discovering so much about the brotherhood . . He paused, radiating a new fear. “It could only be one force.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Langdon	“But the brothers would never talk. They are sworn to secrecy. Even in the face of death.” “Exactly,” [MASK] said. "Meaning, if they never divulged the secret, and they were killed . . .”
<name>James</name>	James	Robert	“The manuscript was clean, [MASK], and I wanted to surprise you with some terrific blurbs.” A pause. "Did you send one to the curator of the Paris Louvre?” “What do you think?
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Teabing	[MASK] slowly unlatched the lid and raised it. As his eyes finally gazed upon the contents, he knew in an instant it could only be the keystone. He was staring at a stone cylinder, crafted of interconnecting lettered dials. The device seemed surprisingly familiar to him.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Langdon	joyous rites to celebrate fertility and the Goddess. [MASK] felt as if he were crossing into another world as he stepped over the bushes to the grassy area within. This hallowed ground was now marked by one of the city’s most unusual monuments.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Vemet	A drop of sweat was preparing to slide down [MASK]’s nose. “You mind?” he said, wiping his nose with his sleeve and motioning to the police car blocking his way. “I’m on a tight schedule.” "Do all the drivers wear Rolexes?”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Sauniere	“Tonight the rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden, and you will live.” The man leveled his gun at the curator’s head. “Is it a secret you will die for?” [MASK] could not breathe.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Langdon	“The chalice,” he said, "resembles a cup or vessel, and more important, it resembles the shape of a woman’s womb. This symbol communicates femininity, womanhood, and fertility.” [MASK] looked directly at her now.
