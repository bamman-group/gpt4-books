<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Beasley	My men are all sore. An' we're broke, with no outfit to speak of. Me an' you never fell out before. But I reckon we might.” “Do I owe you any money--accordin' to the deal?” demanded [MASK].
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Helen	[MASK]'s greeting startled him. “I--I was just looking away yonder,” he said, smiling. She thrilled at the clear, wonderful light of his eyes. “So was I--a moment ago,” she replied, wistfully.
<name>John</name>	John	Anson	The three men dragged the horse out and securely tied him close to a tree. That done, they peered down into the depression. [MASK]'s form could just barely be distinguished in the gloom. He lay stretched out. Another groan escaped him.
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Helen	She shrank from the contact. “Let go!” she burst out, furiously. And instinctively she began to struggle to free herself. Then they all took hold of her. [MASK]'s dignity might never have been!
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Helen	“Cougar means mountain-lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly bear.” “Oh, they're all cruel!” exclaimed [MASK], shrinking. “I reckon. Often I've shot wolves for relayin' a deer.”
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Anson	He also yelled, but that yell was different from [MASK]'s. “Run or dance!” cried the girl. The big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand. She took both hands, and called derisively as she fired again.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Helen	For once the hard, intent quietness, the soul of labor, pain, and endurance so plain in his face was softened by pleasurable emotion. He poked at the burning logs with the toe of his boot. [MASK] observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no spurs.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	But [MASK] must decide from what she saw in his face whether or not to trust him. And that face was clear bronze, unlined, unshadowed, like a tranquil mask, clean-cut, strong-jawed, with eyes of wonderful transparent gray.
<name>Turkey</name>	Turkey	Dale	Here [MASK] flushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their subdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build, showed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Carmichael	“Indeed, sister, I agree with him. You won't obey me.” “Reckon some one's got to be your boss,” drawled [MASK]. “Shore I ain't hankerin' for the job.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dale	It yawned there, a dark-green and bright-gold gulf, asleep under a westering sun, exquisite, wild, lonesome. Then she saw [MASK] standing in the open space between the pines and the spruces. He waved to her. And she returned the salute.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nell	Why, [MASK], he acted--right off--just as if he OWNED me. But he didn't.... And to show him--I--I really did flirt with that Turner fellow. Then he--he insulted me.... Oh, I hate him!”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jim	Other men entered the cabin. “It ain't a-goin' to rain much,” said one. Then came a crash of wood thrown to the ground. “[MASK], hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,” said another.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Nell	Then she had grown considerably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to resemble a boy, yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe. Red spots shone in her cheeks and her eyes held that ever-dangerous blaze. “[MASK], did you give me away to that cowboy?”
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Tom	But he looked happy at thet, an' the last words he said, more to himself than to me, I reckon, was, 'I'm some locoed gent, but if she doesn't call me [MASK] now she's no good!'”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	[MASK]'s eyes feasted afar upon a wild scene of rugged grandeur, before she looked down on this western slope at her feet to see bare, gradual descent, leading down to sparsely wooded bench and on to deep-green canuon. “Ride hard now!”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Beasley	This fellow dropped the bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word. No one spoke. The presence of the horse was significant. With a snarling, muttered curse, [MASK] took up his rifle and strode back to the ranch-house.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Dale	An' he was plumb curious.” “But he missed seein' or hearin' about me,” replied [MASK]. “Mebbe he did an' mebbe he didn't. Anyway, what's the difference whether he finds out this mornin' or this evenin'?”
<name>Yukio</name>	Yukio	Helen	With head bowed, [MASK] rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray rain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed, leaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the mountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.
<name>Mercedes</name>	Mercedes	Bo	Meanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on. [MASK] leaned more and more toward utter reconciliation to it. Her eyes had a wonderful flash, like blue lightning; her cheeks were gold and brown; her hands tanned dark as an Indian's.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Pedro	Oh, I wish he'd come! I don't know what to do.” “Ride back. At least wait for him.” Just then [MASK] spoke differently, in savage barks, and following that came a loud growl and crashings in the brush.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Dale	As there was now no further use for this little habitation, he might better pull it down. [MASK] did not acknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many times. Therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it.
<name>Nellie</name>	Nellie	Bo	[MASK] gave her arm a squeeze. “I hear them. They're fighting. Oh, gee!” she panted, and drew a long, full breath of unutterable excitement. “Keep quiet now an' watch an' listen,” said the hunter.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Dale	The little bear cub whined at his heels; the tame deer seemed to regard him with deep, questioning eyes, the big cougar padded softly here and there as if searching for something. “You all miss them--now--I reckon,” said [MASK].
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Beasley	One of the men came out of a corral leading [MASK]'s saddled and bridled horse. This fellow dropped the bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word. No one spoke. The presence of the horse was significant.
<name>Yuma</name>	Yuma	Dale	I wouldn't lie an' I wouldn't say so if I didn't know shore. I swear [MASK] will back me up. But he can't be here for some days. An' thet gang has got to be bluffed. You ought to see this.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	NELL	I'll bet he had not expected me to be who I was. He thought I was [MASK]!... I look bigger in this buckskin outfit. My hair was up till I lost my hat, and that was when I had the tumble.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Snake	“[MASK], thet's no fault of mine the deal's miscarried. I was square. I made my offer for the workin' out of my plan. It 'ain't been done. Now there's hell to pay an' I'm through.”
<name>Natty</name>	Natty	Helen	Next [MASK] saw a white man, and that was a relief. He stood out in front of the others. Tall and broad, somehow striking, he drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in gray-fringed buckskin, and carrying a rifle.
<name>Blacky</name>	Blacky	Anson	Why, in another day or so we'll be dodgin' lead.” “Tracked! Whar 'd you git thet idee? As soon as this?” queried [MASK], lifting his head like a striking snake. His men, likewise, betrayed sudden interest.
<name>John Thornton</name>	John Thornton	Helen	“An' why can't I?” he demanded, with lowering, dark gaze. “Because your claim is dishonest. And I can prove it,” declared [MASK], forcibly. “Who 're you goin' to prove it to--thet I'm dishonest?”
<name>Miss Trixie</name>	Miss Trixie	Bo	You don't savvy me. I'm shore hatin' myself these days.” “Small wonder. I certainly hate you--with all my heart!” At this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see [MASK] flaunt herself out of the room.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Dale	An' [MASK]'s in love with you!... Why, you couldn't stop them any more 'n you could stop the wind from blowin' down a pine, when it got ready.... Now, it's some different with me. I'm a Mormon
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bo	“My dear, I never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles.” “But I've--I've nursed uncle--sat up with him--just the same as you,” said [MASK], with quivering lips. “Yes, you've been good to him.”
<name>George</name>	George	Milt	He lowered the rifle. “[MASK], it's me lookin' over this gun. How can you stand there an' tell me I'm goin' to shoot high? I had a dead bead on him.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	John	are you as bad as thet?... Let's see. It's the twenty-third of March.” “March! Well, I'm beat. I've lost my reckonin'--an' a lot more, maybe.” “Thar!” declared [MASK], slapping the mustang.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Helen	[MASK] glanced out. A flat, dull-green expanse waved away from the road on and on to a bright, dark horizon-line, where the sun was setting rayless in a clear sky. Open, desolate, and lonely, the scene gave her a cold thrill.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Bo	The spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in the same direction, giving it a smooth, compact appearance, actually as if it had grown there. “That lean-to wasn't there last night?” inquired [MASK]. “I didn't see it.
<name>Daggett</name>	Daggett	Dale	“That mustang didn't break my neck, but he rooted my face in the mud. I'll fix him,” she muttered, as she got up. “Please let me have the towel, now.... Well! Milt [MASK], you're laughing!”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Wal	“Why?” “Bust me if you ain't changed so I hardly knowed you. You've been sick--all alone here!” “Do I look sick?” “[MASK], I should smile. Thin an' pale an' down in the mouth!
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Helen	Twilight was stealing down swiftly. The silence was beautiful, seemingly undisturbed by the soft, silky, dreamy fall of water. [MASK] closed her eyes, ready for sleep, with the physical commotion within her body gradually yielding.
<name>Yankee Sullivan</name>	Yankee Sullivan	Riggs	With one lunge he knocked [MASK] flat, then stood over him with a convulsive hand at his gun. “You white-livered card-sharp! I've a notion to bore you.... They told me you had a deal of your own, an' now I believe it.”
<name>Rosalind</name>	Rosalind	Bo	It was not likely that [MASK] would long be at a loss for words, and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her wonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a twinkling. Anyway, plain it was that a lesson had sunk deep.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Roy	Soon [MASK] and his buckskin-colored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of trees. The unhampered horses led the way; the pack-animals trotted after them; the riders were close behind. All traveled at a jog-trot.
<name>Python</name>	Python	Dale	The ground bore twigs and dead branches, which had to be carefully crawled over; and lying flat, as was necessary, it took prodigious effort to drag her body inch by inch. Like a huge snake, [MASK] wormed his way along. Gradually the wood lightened.
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Bo	Come on with your good word, unless you want to see him lose his job.” [MASK] did not grasp her uncle's bantering, because she was seriously gazing at the cowboy. But she had grasped something.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Dale	An' you jest come over to pay your respects to me, eh?” “Not altogether,” answered [MASK], ponderingly. “First off, I'd like to say I'll pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed.”
<name>Fern</name>	Fern	Helen	From the fields down along the brook came a blended song of swamp-blackbird and meadow-lark. A clarion-voiced burro split the air with his coarse and homely bray. The sheep were bleating, and a soft baa of little lambs came sweetly to [MASK]'s ears.
<name>he</name>	he	Helen	Then presently he came to the top of a well-wooded slope, dark as pitch, apparently. But as [MASK] followed she perceived the trees, and they were thin dwarf spruce, partly dead. The slope was soft and springy, easy to step upon without noise.
<name>Trampas</name>	Trampas	Pedro	Right there the bear came out. He roared. My horse threw me and ran off. [MASK]'s barking saved me--my life, I think. Oh! that was awful! Then the bear went up--there.... And you came.”
<name>John</name>	John	Bo	She was a strong, healthy girl, swift and efficient with her hands, yet this, the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced, almost overcame her. [MASK] outdistanced her by moments, helped her with buttons, and laced one whole boot for her.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Anson	The afternoon hours were long. And they were waiting hours. The act of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did. At sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague, thick twilight. [MASK] rolled over, yawned, and sat up.
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Helen	You've got friends.” [MASK] incoherently thanked him, and, forgetting her usual round of corrals and stables, she hurried back toward the house, deeply stirred, throbbing and dim-eyed, with a feeling she could not control.
<name>Zorro</name>	Zorro	Dale	But the matter of [MASK]'s recovering the girl and doing it speedily strung his mental strength to its highest pitch. Many outlines of action flashed through his mind as he rode on, peering keenly through the night, listening with practised ears. All were rejected.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Dale	“You're welcome, an' I'm sure glad,” responded [MASK], and then, after a few deft, strong pulls at the straps, he continued. “There, he's ready for you.”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Roy	The intelligent animal, with a snort, plunged out of the trail to keep from stepping on her. Then he was above her. “Lookout down there,” yelled [MASK], in warning. “Get on the up side!” But that did not appear possible.
<name>her</name>	her	Dale	With another shock she raised her face--leaned back a little to look at him. “You'll find her--fetch her back?” “Yes,” he answered, instantly. With that ringing word it seemed to [MASK] she realized how she was standing.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Bo	I will not break my promise.” He strode to the window and looked out a moment, and presently, when he turned toward [MASK], he seemed a stronger, loftier, more impelling man, with all his emotions under control.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Al	“I only says--” “Don't tell me thet. My memory's not p-o-r-e,” replied [MASK], mimicking the drawl. “What you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for you.”
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Wal	“Now, will you be makin' camp here?” “[MASK], no. I'll rest a little, an' you can pack the girls' outfit--then we'll go. Sure you're goin' with us?”
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Wilson	[MASK], back to his comrades, grinned his glee, and he wagged his head as if he thought the situation was developing. The gambling outlaws, however, did not at once see the girl preening herself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle.
<name>John</name>	John	Dale	November brought storms up on the peaks. Flurries of snow fell in the park every day, but the sunny south side, where [MASK]'s camp lay, retained its autumnal color and warmth. Not till late in winter did the snow creep over this secluded nook.
<name>Venters</name>	Venters	Helen	This situation was one of the kind that had made him despise the littleness of men. [MASK] assured herself that he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy, in all the relations of life which she had observed while with him. But a doubt lingered in her mind.
<name>Cowboy</name>	Cowboy	Bo	Her hair was tousled, her eyes dancing, her cheeks red. “Be game!” she said. “Stand up like a real Western girl and PULL your boot on.” Whether [MASK]'s scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Helen	But you--you will always come to me--first--if there's trouble.” “I promise,” he replied, soberly, and then went out. [MASK] found that she was trembling, and that there was a commotion in her breast.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Burt	“Come on, I'll help rustle them hosses.” After they had gone [MASK] took his rifle and strolled off into the forest. Then the girl appeared. Her hair was down, her face pale, with dark shadows. She asked for water to wash her face.
<name>Mrs. Allen</name>	Mrs. Allen	Bo	Moreover, the fare was good. She ate heartily, and as for [MASK]'s appetite, she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as amused at it. The young men were all eyes, assiduous in their service to the girls, but speaking seldom.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Helen	[MASK]'s blood leaped with a strange excitement, utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless. Yet her natural fear, and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish risk of this ride, shared alike in her sum of sensations.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Dale	“Will it be safe to leave our hiding-place? I forget so often why we are here.” “We would be better hidden over there than here,” replied [MASK]. “The valley on that side is accessible only from that ridge.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Dale	The hound scented game. “Here's an old kill,” said [MASK], halting to point at some bleached bones scattered under a spruce. Tufts of grayish-white hair lay strewn around. “What was it?”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Anson	From another point in the pitch-black glen rose the wailing, terrible cry of a woman in agony. Wild, haunting, mournful wail! [MASK]'s horse, loosing the halter, plunged back, almost falling over a slight depression in the rocky ground.
<name>Pauline</name>	Pauline	Bo	In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He ran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang standing still. [MASK] was looking up and listening.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Bo	[MASK]'s head jerked back with the force of the blow, but she uttered no cry. “Are you goin' to keep your jaw shut?” he demanded, stridently, and a dark tide of blood surged up into his neck.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Bo	Just plain B-o. Isn't it silly? But I wasn't asked when they gave it to me,” she replied. “[MASK]. It's nice an' short. Never heard it before. But I haven't met many people for years.”
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Jim	“[MASK]--I thought I heard a shot.” The others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate form with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted by sight of sudden death. That emotion was only momentary. “Shot his lamp out!”
<name>Jack London</name>	Jack London	Helen	[MASK] thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot. Rain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring blaze, ten feet high, no water fell.
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	Nell	And then she melted. “Oh, my pretty riding-suit! What a mess! I must be a sight.... [MASK], I rode that wild pony--the sun-of-a-gun! I rode him! That's enough for me.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Dale	In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been such butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple pie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of [MASK]'s few regrets while up in the lonely forest.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Anson	“But I was scared to say so. You-all made fun of me aboot her. Now I shore wish I had spoken up.” [MASK] nodded solemnly. He did not believe the evidence of his sight, but the facts seemed stunning.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Riggs	“When he got out of breath from cussin' he punched [MASK] all about the saloon, threw him outdoors, knocked him down an' kicked him till he got kickin' him down the road with the whole haw-hawed gang behind.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Bo	The big cat followed her everywhere, played with her, rolling and pawing, kitten-like, and he would lay his massive head in her lap to purr his content. [MASK] had little fear of anything, and here in the wilds she soon lost that.
<name>Mr. Jolly</name>	Mr. Jolly	Beasley	I like those boys. They often see me up in the woods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh meat.” “They're workin' for [MASK] now.” “Is that so?”
<name>Almiry</name>	Almiry	Bo	For I shore felt orful queer till I seen [MASK]. She was ridin' down the ridge across the valley. Ridin' some fast, too, an' she'll be here right off, if she doesn't stop in the village.”
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Shore	“[MASK] I did. She's been hawg-tied all the time. An' she said she'd not run off. I'd take thet girl's word even to a sheep-thief.” “A-huh. So would I, for all of thet.
<name>Borson</name>	Borson	Dale	That vast spruce slope seemed to have swallowed her. She was gone! Slowly [MASK] lowered his arm with gesture expressive of a strange finality, an eloquent despair, of which he was unconscious. He turned to the park, to his camp, and the many duties of a hunter.
<name>him</name> (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to the protagonist or narrator of the story, who is not named in this particular passage.)	him (Note: There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to the protagonist or narrator of the story, who is not named in this particular passage.)	Dale	The door of the big sitting-room was open. The scent of flowers, the murmur of bees, the pounding of hoofs came vaguely to [MASK]. His eyes dimmed, so that the ground, when he slid out of his saddle, seemed far below him.
<name>Ulalume</name>	Ulalume	Helen	How marvelously pure! [MASK] shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its music, the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused. Again a sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life, back into the dim remote past from which she had come.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Bo	[MASK] mumbled, and blew like a porpoise. They had to run to the fire before being able to comb their hair. The air was wonderfully keen. The dawn was clear, bright, with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise.
<name>her horse</name>	her horse	Ranger	She remembered that half-way up the slope there was a turn in the trail where it came out upon an open bluff. The time seemed long, but at last she got there. And she checked [MASK] so as to have a moment's gaze down into the park.
<name>the girls</name>	the girls	Dale	She had really never known them as strange joys. She rode, she walked, she climbed a little, she dozed under her pine-tree, she worked helping [MASK] at camp-fire tasks, and when night came she said she did not know herself.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Dale	“Look! See that grass. It has been bent down by the deer bein' dragged over it. Now it's springin' up.” [MASK]'s next stop was on the other side of the swale, under a spruce with low, spreading branches.
<name>Mrs. Beaver</name>	Mrs. Beaver	Helen	Her face paled, her eyes flashed like blue steel. “The bear 'll kill him!” “Oh, that would be dreadful!” replied [MASK], in distress. “But what on earth can we do?”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Dale	She had an eye for beauty, but she was not contemplative. She was now helping [MASK] drive the horses and hold them in rather close formation. She rode well, and as yet showed no symptoms of fatigue or pain.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Helen	Wait, sister, till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots!” With heroic and violent spirit [MASK] sat up to find that in the act her aches and pains appeared beyond number. Reaching for her boots, she found them cold and stiff.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Anson	Next she danced around a pine, then danced into her little green inclosure. From which presently she sent out the most doleful moans. “Aww! What a shame!” burst out [MASK]. “Thet fine, healthy, nervy kid! Clean gone!
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Dale	The flock held a compact formation, covering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three herders on horses and several pack-burros. [MASK] engaged one of the Mexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed northward and down along the trail.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Helen	It was July, and there were no golden-red glorious flames and blazes of color such as lingered in [MASK]'s memory. Black spruce slopes and green pines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark outcroppings of rock--these colors and forms greeted her gaze with all the old enchantment.
<name>Carlson</name>	Carlson	Dale	Then he raised a big hand that shook. [MASK] saw in a flash how the old man's nerves had gone. “Don't mention--thet--thet greaser--to me!” burst out the rancher. “It makes me see--red....
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Helen	An' then, if you're interested,' to show you how little so-called civilized people know of nature.” [MASK] realized then that whatever his calling, hunter or wanderer or hermit, he was not uneducated, even if he appeared illiterate.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Roy	He was great. But he did not know that. Then the door of the living-room opened, and a sweet, high voice pealed out: “[MASK]! Oh, what a mustang! Whose is he?”
