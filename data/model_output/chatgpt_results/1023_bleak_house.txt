<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Charley	At our usual bed-time, [MASK] and I were rolling away seaward with the Kentish letters. It was a night's journey in those coach times, but we had the mail to ourselves and did not find the night very tedious.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Rick	It will be like coming to the old Bleak House again." "And you will come there too, I hope, [MASK]. I am a solitary man now, you know, and it will be a charity to come to me.
<name>Nancy</name>	Nancy	Charley	If you please, miss, his wife is a beautiful woman, but she broke her ankle, and it never joined. And her brother's the sawyer that was put in the cage, miss, and they expect he'll drink himself to death entirely on beer," said [MASK].
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Esther	"I don't know who may not, if you may not." "You say, yourself, you are not leading a very settled life." "How can I, my dear [MASK], with nothing settled!" "Are you in debt again?"
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ada	"Not heard of him, perhaps?" said I. "Yes, I have heard of him," said [MASK]. Such tears in her eyes, and such love in her face. I could not make my darling out.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Guster	[MASK] having never left the end of the passage, the whole household are assembled. "The simple question is, sir," says the constable, "whether you know this boy. He says you do."
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Ada	They throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married then. I was the happiest of the happy. It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked [MASK] when she would come home.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Esther	When she is gone, he goes down too, and returning with his cobweb-covered bottle, devotes himself to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents, now and then, as he throws his head back in his chair, catching sight of the pertinacious Roman pointing from the ceiling. CHAPTER XLIII [MASK]'s Narrative
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Ada	While [MASK] was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say with how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick face, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered iron-grey.
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Richard	I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before. "That's the thing, sir," repeated [MASK] with the greatest enthusiasm. "We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!" He was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Ada	He was animated and glowing, as if [MASK]'s tenderness had gratified him; but I could only hope, with a sigh, that the letter might have some stronger effect upon his mind on re-perusal than it assuredly had then.
<name>he</name>	he	Ada	When [MASK] was singing in the dark room?" I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then. Unless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so. "Because--" said I with a little hesitation. "
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	George	"You know yourself, [MASK]," says the elder brother, returning the grip of his hand, "and perhaps you know me better than I know myself. Take your way. So that we don't quite lose one another again, take your way."
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Krook	Can't you wake him?" "No." "What have you done with your candle?" "It's gone out. Here it is." [MASK] takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and tries to get a light.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Caddy	I felt in this short conversation--though I did not know how, for she was quiet, and we interchanged no look--that my dear girl well remembered how merrily she had clasped me round the waist when no other hands than [MASK]'s had brought me the little parting token.
<name>Mr. Jaggers</name>	Mr. Jaggers	Ada	He arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening, and had a long conference with my guardian. Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where [MASK] and I were sitting and said, "Come in, my dears!"
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Ada	"No?" said I. "Not even that?" "No, not even that!" said [MASK], shaking her head. "Why, you never mean to say--" I was beginning in joke.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Charley	"Well, [MASK]," said I, looking over a copy of the letter O in which it was represented as square, triangular, pear-shaped, and collapsed in all kinds of ways, "we are improving.
<name>weapon</name>	weapon	Bucket	Now, suppose I had killed him. Suppose I really had discharged into his body any one of those pistols recently fired off that [MASK] has found at my place, and dear me, might have found there any day since it has been my place.
<name>he</name>	he	Richard	Enough of that. All [MASK] had to start him in the race of life is ventured. I recommend to him and you, for his sake and your own, that he should depart from us with the understanding that there is no sort of contract between you.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Richard	He no more gathers grapes from thorns or figs from thistles than older men did in old times." His gentleness and consideration for [MASK] whenever we spoke of him touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon.
<name>Miss Flite</name>	Miss Flite	mademoiselle	Because you have known perfectly that I was en-r-r-r-raged!" It appears impossible for [MASK] to roll the letter "r" sufficiently in this word, notwithstanding that she assists her energetic delivery by clenching both her hands and setting all her teeth.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	mademoiselle	Ah, could I have the honour of being your domestic!" "I am sorry--" I began. "Do not dismiss me so soon, [MASK]!" she said with an involuntary contraction of her fine black eyebrows. "Let me hope a moment!
<name>brother</name>	brother	George	"My blessing on him, never! He was always fond of me, and loving to me, was my [MASK]! But he had a bold spirit, and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Richard	Now, I have had very little pleasure at our dear [MASK]'s lately, and your practical sagacity demonstrates why. Our young friends, losing the youthful poetry which was once so captivating in them, begin to think, 'This is a man who wants pounds.'
<name>Sherlock</name>	Sherlock	Richard	Besides, I find it unsettles me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of action. So what," continued [MASK], confident again by this time, "do I naturally turn my thoughts to?"
<name>he</name>	he	Charley	Admitting this to myself with a reluctant heart, I said I would return to the hotel and wait until he joined me there, so he threw a cloak over his shoulders and saw me to the gate, and [MASK] and I went back along the beach.
<name>Mr. Pickwick</name>	Mr. Pickwick	Richard	Please her! It won't take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the shop if t'other door's out of order!" we all went in, stimulated by [MASK]'s laughing encouragement and relying on his protection. "
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Rick	I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself even then, than with poor [MASK], for I brought you together. But, tut, all this is nothing! He has time before him, and the race to run. I think the worse of him?
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Richard	"That's the man! He does me more good than anybody. What a fascinating child it is!" I asked [MASK] if any one knew of their coming down together. He answered, no, nobody.
<name>Biddy</name>	Biddy	Charley	Looking up, I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot. "[MASK]," said I, "are you so cold?" "I think I am, miss," she replied. "I don't know what it is.
<name>Mr. Jarndyce</name>	Mr. Jarndyce	Richard	Our all three coming together for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we talked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its red eyes at us--as [MASK] said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ada	Would she go with me? Yes, [MASK] thought she had better go with me. Should we go now? Yes, let us go now. Well, I could not understand my darling, with the tears in her eyes and the love in her face!
<name>son</name>	son	Esther	Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to express--as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear [MASK] in her prayers.
<name>Kitty</name>	Kitty	Caddy	The plain breakfast made a cheerful show, and [MASK] was perfectly charming. But when my darling came, I thought--and I think now--that I never had seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet's.
<name>Mr. Fezziwig</name>	Mr. Fezziwig	Prince	[MASK]'s health is not strong, and I want to be able to assist him. What with schools, and classes here, and private pupils, AND the apprentices, he really has too much to do, poor fellow!"
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Charley	I was never tired of seeing [MASK] in the full enjoyment of that great dignity, standing before me with her youthful face and figure, and her steady manner, and her childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the pleasantest way. "
<name>Mr. Creakle</name>	Mr. Creakle	Jo	Then comes another certain person, in the person of yourself, and charges me, in an equally solemn way, not to mention [MASK] to that other certain person above all other persons. Why, this is a private asylum!
<name>Copperfield</name>	Copperfield	Charley	[MASK] and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages, I am sure, for in a week's time the people were so glad to see us go by, though ever so frequently in the course of a day, that there were faces of greeting in every cottage.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Jo	[MASK], very doubtful of his reverend friend's intentions and not at all clear but that something practical and painful is going to be done to him, mutters, "You let me alone. I never said nothink to you. You let me alone." "
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Tony	See again, on the table here! Confound the stuff, it won't blow off--smears like black fat!" They look at one another, and [MASK] goes listening to the door, and a little way upstairs, and a little way downstairs.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Devil	Ask this man. He heerd it all, and see it all. He knows." The other man repeated, "That's all about it." "Was the lady crying?" I inquired. "[MASK] a bit," returned the first man.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Charley	Our little room was like a ship's cabin, and that delighted [MASK] very much. Then the fog began to rise like a curtain, and numbers of ships that we had had no idea were near appeared. I don't know how many sail the waiter told us were then lying in the downs.
<name>Pip</name>	Pip	Phil	"What set me on about country boys, and runaways, and good-for-nothings? You, to be sure! So you never clapped your eyes upon the country--marshes and dreams excepted. Eh?" [MASK] shakes his head.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Brother	CHAPTER XI Our Dear [MASK] A touch on the lawyer's wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room, irresolute, makes him start and say, "What's that?" "It's me," returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his ear. "
<name>Mrs. Veteran</name>	Mrs. Veteran	Volumnia	But she is a little dreaded elsewhere in consequence of an indiscreet profusion in the article of rouge and persistency in an obsolete pearl necklace like a rosary of little bird's-eggs. In any country in a wholesome state, [MASK] would be a clear case for the pension list.
<name>Mr. Jarndyce</name>	Mr. Jarndyce	Rick	Well," said my guardian, by no means displeased with this artless reply, "if you come to any kind of journeying with [MASK], you must borrow the money of me (never breathing the least allusion to that circumstance), and leave the calculation to him."
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	George!--that	He is a slow-torturing kind of man. He is no more like flesh and blood than a rusty old carbine is. He is a kind of man--by [MASK] has caused me more restlessness, and more uneasiness, and more dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together.
<name>Sir Leicester Dedlock</name>	Sir Leicester Dedlock	Cuffy	On the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it that is in question--is attributable to [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Richard	[MASK] was extremely agitated and was so weak and low, though his illness was still of the mind, that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported. But she looked forward--a very little way now--to the help that was to come to her, and never drooped.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Ada	I was only too happy to be in such request. "For me then," returned my guardian, "or for [MASK], or for both of us. It is somebody's birthday to-morrow, I think." "
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Jo	[MASK]'s ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a bishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (if he only knew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest thing of all.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tony	As he is going to do so again, he happens to look at his coat-sleeve. It takes his attention. He stares at it, aghast. "Why, [MASK], what on earth is going on in this house to-night?
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Richard	I am not at all changeable; but I am not unreasonable, and should never blame you. Even cousins may be sorry to part; and in truth I am very, very sorry, [MASK], though I know it's for your welfare.
<name>the stationer</name>	the stationer	Tony	I hope he does, I am sure." "I hope he does," says [MASK]. "But I doubt it." "You find the rent too high, do you, sir?" returns the stationer. "Rents ARE high about here.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Caddy	It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room, and the clearance it required then was so discouraging that [MASK], who was almost tired out, sat down in the middle of the dust and cried.
<name>wife</name>	wife	Caroline	anticipating some self-denying objection on his son's part with a great air. "You and our [MASK] will be strange in the upper part of the premises and will, therefore, dine that day in my apartment. Now, bless ye!"
<name>Edmond</name>	Edmond	George	"I can tell you, [MASK]," replies the ironmaster deliberately, "how it is not to be brought about, which I hope may answer the purpose as well. Look at our mother, think of her, recall her emotion when she recovered you.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Briton	Once pointing, always pointing--like any Roman, or even [MASK], with a single idea. There he is, no doubt, in his impossible attitude, pointing, unavailingly, all night long. Moonlight, darkness, dawn, sunrise, day.
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Ada	I take them everywhere." I was afterwards convinced (and so was [MASK]) that from the ill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He turned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.
<name>Sam Weller</name>	Sam Weller	Phil	When--" "When you stops, you know," cries [MASK], putting down his cup and saucer and hastily removing his plate from his knees, "and says to me, 'What, comrade! You have been in the wars!'
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Esther	"[MASK]," he returned, "it is indeed. I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me (as the catechism goes) would far rather be without me than with me. And they are right.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Richard	"Are you in debt again?" "Why, of course I am," said [MASK], astonished at my simplicity. "Is it of course?" "My dear child, certainly. I can't throw myself into an object so completely without expense.
<name>Jerry</name>	Jerry	Jo	The cart is shaken all to pieces, and the rugged road is very near its end. "[MASK], my poor fellow!" "I hear you, sir, in the dark, but I'm a-gropin--a-gropin--let me catch hold of your hand."
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Ada	A charity to come to me, my love!" he repeated to [MASK] as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips. (I think he vowed within himself to cherish her if she were left alone.)
<name>Mr. McCawber</name>	Mr. McCawber	Prince	[MASK] was teaching, of course. We found him engaged with a not very hopeful pupil--a stubborn little girl with a sulky forehead, a deep voice, and an inanimate, dissatisfied mama--whose case was certainly not rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which we threw her preceptor.
<name>him</name>	him	Ada	But as he would on no account accept this offer, she took a graceful leave of [MASK]--none of me--and put her hand upon his proffered arm, and got into the carriage, which was a little, low, park carriage with a hood.
<name>dear</name>	dear	Allan	So he said, "My precious little woman, what are you doing here?" And I said, "The moon is shining so brightly, [MASK], and the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here thinking."
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Esther	"Once more, duty, duty, [MASK]," said I; "and if you are not overjoyed to do it, more than cheerfully and contentedly, through anything and everything, you ought to be. That's all I have to say to you, my dear!"
<name>Mr. Jarndyce</name>	Mr. Jarndyce	Ada	He received everything I said with patience and gentleness, but it all rebounded from him without taking the least effect. I could not wonder at this after the reception his preoccupied mind had given to my guardian's letter, but I determined to try [MASK]'s influence yet.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Ada	I rather feel it to be so. But I shall be able to give myself fair-play by and by. I shall come all right again, then, don't you be afraid." I asked him if this were all he wished me to tell [MASK].
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Charley	"I don't want no shelter," he said; "I can lay amongst the warm bricks." "But don't you know that people die there?" replied [MASK]. "They dies everywheres," said the boy.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Ada	"All true," said [MASK], "but that he is such a devoted friend to us we owe to you." I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it. So I said as much.
<name>Caesar</name>	Caesar	Caesar	I feel myself as far above suspicion as [MASK]'s wife." Anything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself, as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers, was surely never seen in anybody else!
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	William	"Mother," interposed her son, always getting before her and pushing her back with one shoulder as she sidled at my guardian, "WILL you hold your tongue?" "No, [MASK]," she returned, "I won't!
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Richard	At that time, and for a good many weeks after that time, [MASK] was constant in his visits. Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and remaining with us until Monday morning, he sometimes rode out on horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back again early next day.
<name>Abelwhite</name>	Abelwhite	Gridley	"You remember, miss, that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning? [MASK]," in a low whisper behind his hand. "Yes," said I. "He is hiding at my place. I couldn't mention it.
<name>Dr. John Watson</name>	Dr. John Watson	Charley	They came out with me directly to look at the boy. The servants had gathered in the hall too, and he shivered in the window-seat with [MASK] standing by him, like some wounded animal that had been found in a ditch.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Charley	"YOU tell me. Ain't the lady the t'other lady?" [MASK] shook her head as she methodically drew his rags about him and made him as warm as she could. "Oh!" the boy muttered. "Then I s'pose she ain't.
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	Humph	And it has been renewed no end of times. What do you say now?" "I say that I think the times is come to a end at last." "You do? [MASK]! I am much of the same mind myself."
<name>Uriah</name>	Uriah	George	"Now lookee here, [MASK]," said the man, turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger. "You know me, and I know you. You're a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Charley	There was a bank here, too, which was a famous one for violets; and as it was a daily delight of [MASK]'s to gather wild flowers, she took as much to the spot as I did.
<name>he</name>	he	Ada	When shall [MASK] come to see you, my love?" I had been thinking of that too. A little in connexion with the absent mirrors, but not much, for I knew my loving girl would be changed by no change in my looks.
<name>Mr. Chadband</name>	Mr. Chadband	Snagsby	[MASK] repeats the word with pathetic emphasis--"in the court. The effects of which movement it is impossible to calculate. I shouldn't wonder if it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even in the neighbours' minds, not mentioning (if such a thing was possible) my little woman.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Mercury	With this apology, [MASK] directs a scornful and indignant look at the young man of the name of Guppy which plainly says, "What do you come calling here for and getting ME into a row?" "It's quite right.
<name>Eppie</name>	Eppie	Charley	The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by [MASK]. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us over the burden that clung to her most affectionately.
<name>Maria</name>	Maria	Esther	A light shone in upon me all at once. "Never any more. I am going to stay with my dear husband. We have been married above two months. Go home without me, my own [MASK]; I shall never go home any more!"
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Allan	[MASK], take my dear." He moved away from under the green roof of leaves, and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us, said, "I shall be found about here somewhere. It's a west wind, little woman, due west!
<name>Mr. Jarndyce</name>	Mr. Jarndyce	Ada	I repeated the old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old peace had not departed from it. My guardian now came every day. In a week or so more I could walk about our rooms and hold long talks with [MASK] from behind the window-curtain.
<name>Themis</name>	Themis	Krook	Isn't it an extraordinary thing of [MASK] to have appointed twelve o'clock to-night to hand 'em over to me?" "Very. What did he do it for?" "What does he do anything for? HE don't know.
<name>everything</name>	everything	Coavinses	He could had dispensed with [MASK]. There had been times when, if he had been a sultan, and his grand vizier had said one morning, "What does the Commander of the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?"
<name>dear</name>	dear	Rick	"I--here! Take it away, my dear. I don't know what I am about with it; it's all the wind--invariably has that effect--I won't press you, [MASK]; you may be right.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Richard	Better to borrow, better to beg, better to die!" We were all startled by the fervour of this warning. [MASK] bit his lip and held his breath, and glanced at me as if he felt, and knew that I felt too, how much he needed it.
<name>George</name>	George	Judy	Curse him!" says the excellent old gentleman apart to [MASK] as the trooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside. "He owes me money, and might think of paying off old scores in this murdering place.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Ada	We spoke of the future as much as possible, and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet. [MASK] would contrive to take him, somehow, he said.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Richard	I believe [MASK]'s was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his wild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Ada	[MASK] and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room, I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among his books. I knew he always read at that hour, and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading-lamp.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Johnny	On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from his pocket and split [MASK]'s head (which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels).
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Caddy	Then [MASK] hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain. All this took place in the hall. Her father released her, took out his pocket handkerchief, and sat down on the stairs with his head against the wall.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Ada	She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose, and a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room. And she really did, for she knocked down little chairs with her skirts that were quite a great way off. As only [MASK]
