<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Esther	Then the other day I saw her, in the trees beyond the barn.” “That’s the dardnest thing. I mean there’s the Wright girls, but that’s a good ten miles off, probably more...” [MASK]’s voice trailed off as she sat down.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	And I just don’t see how I can do it on my own.” He walked out, but kept himself from slamming the door. irp- Even as a boy [MASK] had loved the smell of the ground softening in the thaw and coming back to life.
<name>he</name>	he	Jack	It wasn’t until they neared the house that he spoke again. “It doesn’t make any sense, letting it get away.” “Let’s just say I know that one. He used to belong to somebody,” and [MASK] found the words hard.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Mabel	“So what have you been sewing on over there?” “Oh, just a little something.” “A secret? A Christmas present, then, is it?” “Not for you. Not this one,” and [MASK] smiled up at him.
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Mabel	Her stride was long and sure as she moved through the newly sprouted grass and beneath the leafing cottonwood tree, and as she neared [MASK] saw that her skin was tanned. She wore no shoes or moccasins. Tall and lean, she showed no signs of pregnancy yet.
<name>Daenerys</name>	Daenerys	Faina	CHAPTER 53 The night was cool and pale blue, and [MASK] lay naked atop the wedding quilt. She was on her side, her long legs askew, one arm beneath her head, the other curved below the slight round of her belly.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Garrett	he whispered loudly through the fabric. His mother came to him and put her hands to his shoulders. “Not yet, [MASK]. Not yet,” and her tone, gentle and kind, was so unlike his mother that it terrified him all the more.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Garrett	“We’ll see.” “They always are. Next time he’ll be picking through your dump pile or sniffing around the barn.” [MASK] walked ahead, and as they circled the field he watched where the fox had run but didn’t say anything.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Garrett	Can you hear me?” Yes, [MASK], and it was the voice he loved, the one that was like a sweet whisper in his ear. We’re all right. Then there was the child’s cry again, racking and tiny.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Faina	“[MASK]?” There was no answer. His eyes adjusted. The walls around him were made of logs that had been squared off with an ax. Above him was a wooden ceiling, with a square opening to the sky not much bigger than a stovepipe.
<name>Lyddie</name>	Lyddie	Mabel	Let her live out there, like a starving animal? Motherless. Fatherless. Starving for food and love. How could you?” She shoved her way past to the coat hooks. “[MASK]? What are you doing? Where are you going?”
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Mabel	“When my hair has all turned gray,” a swoop and a twirl beside the kitchen table, “will you kiss me then and say, that you love me in December as you do in May?” And then they were beside the woodstove and [MASK] kissed him with her mouth open and soft.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Esther	The time she spent with [MASK] was good. But whenever they discussed the little girl, she became agitated. He often caught her looking out the window. The same traits that as a young woman had made her so alluring now made her seem unwell.
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	“You’re not just flattering me?” She touched her hair with one hand. “Put it back on, so we can see again,” [MASK] said. “It does fit well,” she said, “as if it were tailored for me.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Jack	She’d picked up her books and pencils again, too. [MASK] took note of that. The child was always bringing something new for her to draw—an owl feather, a cluster of mountain ash berries, a spruce bough with the cones still attached.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Faina	Do you feel it? She pressed his hand more firmly into her, and something pushed back. Was that... ? She grinned again and nodded. He kept his hand there and [MASK]’s belly moved in a swell, as if the unborn baby were turning a somersault.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Mabel	It was the smell of oak trees on the summer evening she fell in love, and the way dawn threw itself across the cow pond and turned the water to light. [MASK] could not remember the last time she caught such a flicker.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	And even if we did fall through, this isn’t the main channel. The water’s only a foot deep. We’d just get cold and wet, but even that won’t happen. I promise. [MASK] put on his own skates and led them onto the ice.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Mabel	His words came through a slurry of dirt and blood. [MASK] knelt beside him and with her sleeve tried to wipe the mess away from his mouth. “How did this happen?” “Black bear.” “Here?” “By the woods.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mabel	[MASK] guarded the snow angels, and they didn’t fade. They glittered and shone beneath the blue sky as the days lengthened. When the sun glared down, she feared they would melt, but the air stayed cool and the snow fluffy and dry.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Jack	My papa, she whispered. What happened? I tried. I tried and tried. [MASK] looked into her eyes, and it was like watching water gather on lake ice. No sloppy dribble, no sobs. Only a quiet pool on the blue.
<name>James</name>	James	Jack	“A kick? You mean it has alcohol in it?” “Does it have alcohol in it? Are you pulling my leg? Don’t know what the point be, otherwise.” “Oh, [MASK]. I had no idea.
<name>Moose</name>	Moose	Jack	Its antlers could have held [MASK] like a cradle, and his arms could not have circled its barrel chest. It had to weigh more than a thousand pounds, and that meant hundreds of pounds of good, fresh meat. He’d done it.
<name>him</name>	him	Mabel	It was good to see. But it also scared him how much the girl was growing on [MASK]. On him, too. He could admit that. He might not watch out the window, but he waited just the same, and hoped for her.
<name>Elsa</name>	Elsa	Mabel	But all afternoon the clouds remained high and thin, the wind ripped dead leaves from the tree branches, and daylight guttered like a candle. [MASK] thought of the terrible cold that would trap her alone in the cabin, and her breathing turned shallow and rapid.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Mabel	I even brought you a clean one. Come on now,” and she crawled beneath her covers and patted the bedroll beside her. [MASK] found it an unexpected relief to rest her head on a pillow, to be clean and fed and not alone.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Mabel	She wore that same cotton dress with tiny flowers on it, but [MASK] could see now that it was a summer dress for a grown woman. Beneath it, she wore a long-underwear shirt that was too small; the sleeves did not reach her thin wrists.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jack	She needs a friend.” “But can she care for it?” “Oh, she’ll manage fine. It’ll be good for her.” “Are you sure?” [MASK] must have noticed her anxious tone because he looked at her more closely.
<name>he</name>	he	Mabel	It’s perfect. Perfect snow for a snowman.” He hesitated. He was tired. It was late. They were too old for such nonsense. There were a dozen reasons not to, [MASK] knew, but instead he set the lantern back in the snow.
<name>he</name>	he	Mabel	Not far from the cabin, he had laid several logs side by side, and on top of these he had piled caribou hides and beaver pelts until they formed a thick mattress. The night was calm and cold, perhaps the coldest [MASK] had ever known.
<name>Mrs. Hale</name>	Mrs. Hale	Mabel	It had been a cold winter, cold and calm and snowy, and the wood-piles were dwindling already. [MASK] went to the window, still patting the newborn and swaying from side to side. The baby quieted and stared wide-eyed over her shoulder.
<name>Thoreau</name>	Thoreau	Mabel	[MASK] walked there in the morning and was grateful to be alone. It had become a holy place, the sound of the river, the fragrance of the freshly peeled spruce logs, the blue sky, the green meadow.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Mabel	Standing still, she became aware of the cold through her damp clothes and trembled. “Chilled?” She shook her head. “Let’s go in and warm up.” [MASK] didn’t want it to end. The quiet snow, the closeness.
<name>me</name>	me	Faina	He remained near the door, shifting awkwardly in his boots. “No, actually, well, I brought it for her.” “Not for [MASK]?” “You don’t think she’ll like it?” “Oh. Well, yes.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Mabel	*4* It was as if [MASK] had fallen through a hole into another world. It was nothing like her quiet, well-ordered world of darkness and light and sadness. This was an untidy place, but welcoming and full of laughter.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Ada	she had called to her sister. I’ve caught a fairy. Come and look. Now you’ll see they’re real. And [MASK] came, sleepy-eyed and grumbling, and they walked in their bare feet and nightgowns out to the oak tree.
<name>he</name>	he	Jack	Like somebody else was chopping wood.” “Bull moose. Calling to you, smacking his antlers against a tree. He wanted to fight you. He thought you were another bull.” The boy almost smirked, as if [MASK] were far from the stature of a moose.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Mabel	I have something, the girl said and pulled at [MASK]’s hand. Oh, child, you surprised me. Please hurry, she said. Is it something to draw? The child nodded and tugged at her. Where?
<name>George</name>	George	Jack	Then she moved her legs side to side. All right? she asked. [MASK] reached down to her, they clasped hands, mittens and work gloves, and he grunted as he pulled her to her feet. Oh, look! Look! the child cried out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Faina	Son? That’s right. As if there weren’t enough of you around here. When he got to the bedside, he put an arm around [MASK]’s shoulder and looked down into the blanket where a small, wrinkled, and red face looked up at him.
<name>Eileen</name>	Eileen	Mabel	[MASK] dozed by the woodstove just before noon, a book propped open in her lap. Most of the winter she hadn’t allowed herself to sleep in the middle of the day, if for no other reason than to prove she had not even a touch of cabin fever.
<name>Bigfoot</name>	Bigfoot	Faina	At one point she realized that something was crashing through the trees beside her and she stopped, her heart pounding, her breath ragged. “[MASK]? Is that you?” she whispered loudly. But she knew it wasn’t the child. It was something much bigger.
<name>Mrs. Rachel Lynde</name>	Mrs. Rachel Lynde	Mabel	The girl backed away, until she was pressed against the door and the puppy was jumping at her. It’s all right, child. It’s only a puppy, [MASK] said. And I’d say it’s already quite fond of you. He won’t bite.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Faina	“He’s coming in now, ladies. Coming to see his baby.” “Give us just a cotton-picking second. Let us get everybody cleaned up.” “Is she OK? [MASK], are you all right? Can you hear me?”
<name>her</name>	her	Mabel	After kindling the fire and pulling another quilt over [MASK] as she slept, he set off for town. It was the coldest it had been all winter, and by the time he arrived at the general store, he wondered if his nose was frostbitten.
<name>Mrs. Hinch</name>	Mrs. Hinch	Betty	“No ma’am, never did,” he said. He studied her thoughtfully. “Are you wanting a fox ruff? Because if you are, I’ve got a few pelts left over from last year. I’m sure [MASK] could sew you something.”
<name>Aunt March</name>	Aunt March	Mabel	You will leave now, so I can put on the dress. Are you sure? It will still be a surprise. [MASK] let her eyes dart around the room, but the dress was nowhere to be seen. Please. All right. All right, child.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Faina	Eight years she’d lived here, and at last the land had taken hold of her, and she could comprehend some small part of [MASK]’s wildness. $ The seasons of the past six years had been like an ocean tide, giving and taking, pulling the girl away and then bringing her back.
<name>one</name>	one	Mabel	Passing their toddlers in a hall, mothers would tousle their hair or even sweep them up in their arms and kiss them hard along their chins and necks until the children squealed with glee. Where else in life, [MASK] wondered, could a woman love so openly and with such abandon?
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Esther	I saw... a wolverine.” “Don’t tease the boy,” [MASK] admonished as she flipped the sizzling grayling. “No teasing. I was way up high, above the tree line, in this little valley I once visited a long time ago.
<name>Jem</name>	Jem	George	Couldn’t help myself.” He smacked his lips. “It was mighty good, though.” “You’d better be joking or I’ll—” [MASK] grinned and pulled the cake out from behind his back. “Not one piece missing.
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Mabel	I told [MASK] here she’s got to get out of the cabin more. All this talk about little girls running around in the trees. Next thing you know she’ll be holding tea parties in the front yard, wearing nothing but her skivvies and a flowered hat.”
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Jack	“Doesn’t she understand that we love her?” [MASK] went to the open door. It was a clear, calm night, the moon shining through the branches. He saw the child at the edge of the forest. She had stopped and was looking back at the cabin.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Garrett	[MASK] works better here than he ever did at home, and our planting’s done. You can fix him a place in the barn to get him out of your hair. Then you two can have your place back to yourselves.”
<name>They</name>	They	Jack	She didn’t want to encourage this. [MASK] might need help this particular day, but they were not in need of friends or neighbors. Otherwise, why had they come here? They could have stayed home, where there were people enough for anyone.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	Then, as she broke through the trees and out into the yard, she heard it clearly—laughter. [MASK] and the child stood side by side, their arms outstretched and hands nearly touching. Then, without warning, they threw themselves backward into the deep snow.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Faina	So he hauled their wedding bed to the cabin, along with the quilt his mother had sewed for them and the feather pillows and soft sheets they had been given as wedding gifts. [MASK]’s fingertips grazed his bare arm, and she laughed. But you are cold.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Garrett	They’re not real common,” [MASK] said. “Mostly bring in reds and cross foxes. You ever see one of those crosses? They’re a mix of red and black, and they’ve got a black cross along their back.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jack	Over his shoulder he called, “Time for supper. Let’s go in.” And the girl followed. [MASK] held the cabin door open for her. She entered gingerly, as if the floor might fall out from under her, but all the same she came in.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Mabel	Where the light spilled ahead of her, [MASK] saw that the snow was disturbed. She ran to the tracks. She looked up and down the trail, trying to see where they went and where they came from. Could these be the girl’s?
<name>Lirael</name>	Lirael	Garrett	[MASK] lowered himself to the ground, not wanting to be seen. As the girl stepped toward the swan, the beating of its wings became more powerful, swirling the snow and air, and its hisses turned into a terrible, cracking growl.
<name>he</name>	he	Garrett	He would never catch one in the lowlands where he trapped coyote, fox, beaver, and mink. He followed the tracks up into a narrow ravine where boulders were hidden by the snow. The horse stumbled occasionally, and finally [MASK] dismounted and led the animal.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Faina	“It is practical. I’ll be warmer with it.” CHAPTER 32 Where were you, child? Just now? I was at the river. That’s where I found this. In her hand, [MASK] held a wind-dried salmon skull.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Mabel	“I suppose a lot of characters have come through here over the years,” he said. “Oh, sure. This place draws kooks like flies. We count ourselves among the sane ones, and that tells you something.” [MASK] did smile then.
<name>me</name>	me	Mabel	“We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you two.” His voice was gravelly and genuine, but there was a dimness behind his eyes that reminded [MASK] of shame. “I don’t know how we’ll ever repay you.”
<name>Ed</name>	Ed	Jack	Can I sleep in the barn for the night?” “Sure,” [MASK] said. “Looks like you found her a good husky.” “Yep. He’s a fast learner, and there’s nothing he wants to do more than work.”
<name>he</name>	he	Garrett	She began to unbutton her coat. Spellbound, [MASK] watched even as he felt he should look away. She set the coat on a bush behind her, then her hat as well. She wore a flowered cotton dress with what looked like long underwear beneath it.
<name>Miss Honey</name>	Miss Honey	Mabel	Have you never seen yourself, child? The girl shook her head. Never? Not in a mirror? Well, I have just the thing. Much better than any drawing I can manage. [MASK] went to the bedroom and came back with a hand mirror.
<name>Winter</name>	Winter	Jack	As if to confirm her suspicions, her teeth began to chatter. It started as a small shiver along her jaw as she sucked air between her clenched teeth, but soon her whole body shook and her very bones seemed to clatter. “[MASK].”
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Faina	If she were injured or killed, when he could have kept her safe, he would never forgive himself. [MASK] had already fastened the shining silver buttons on her new coat. Please don’t be angry, she said. Can’t you hear the wind?
<name>Miss Potter</name>	Miss Potter	Mabel	Would you like to see? Is it finished? [MASK] smiled. As well as I can for today. She turned the sketchpad toward the child, not knowing what reaction to expect. The child took in a breath, then clasped her hands in delight.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Garrett	“It’s not snowing.” “Don’t worry. Bet you anything it’ll come tonight,” [MASK] said. All through dinner, the boy could hardly stay in his seat, even as they commended him on the good-tasting fish he had helped catch.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	George	It was the coldest it had been all winter, and by the time he arrived at the general store, he wondered if his nose was frostbitten. He stood just inside the door and rubbed it gingerly. “Don’t worry,” [MASK] teased from where he stood at the potbellied stove.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Garrett	She had led him to a bear den. [MASK] squatted in his snowshoes beside her and leaned into the hole. He thought he could make out roots and black dirt, but it was so dark he couldn’t be sure.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Esther	“She had to have yards and yards of the stuff,” [MASK] said. “She wanted ruffles and pleats and layers. It was a miracle we could see her through it all. All I can say is. I’m glad her parents paid for the dress to be made.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Roy	My sister’s come to live with us, and [MASK] says she’s got to earn her keep by doing the baking.” He picked up the bills and put them in his coat pocket as if he hadn’t heard what she’d said. Then it registered.
<name>Trapper</name>	Trapper	Garrett	You’ve cooked a lynx?” “Oh, don’t make that face. Have you ever had it? Absolutely, positively the best meat you’ll ever taste. [MASK] had it live in a snare, so he killed it clean and brought home the meat.
<name>Coach</name>	Coach	Esther	You’ve got us for the rest of the season, or until you get sick of us.” “[MASK]—no, no. We can’t allow this.” “Can’t allow it? I don’t think you understand who you’re up against here, dear heart.
<name>Jessie</name>	Jessie	Jack	There she stopped. He did not raise his head. She was out of breath, her voice hushed but sharp. “She is coming back. And damn it. [MASK], I won’t let you or anyone else tell me differently.”
<name>rescue</name>	rescue	Mabel	The ravens and magpies would come to tear away at his frozen flesh, maybe a pack of wolves would eventually find its way to his carcass, and soon he’d be nothing but a strewn pile of bones. His only hope would be [MASK], but then he thought of her struggling under his dead weight.
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Ada	It would soon be gone. 0 She had thought often of [MASK]’s words about inventing new endings to stories and choosing joy over sorrow. In recent years she had decided her sister had been in part wrong. Suffering and death and loss were inescapable.
<name>Perdita</name>	Perdita	Garrett	She didn’t move for some time. [MASK]’s legs were stiff from the cold, and he felt the need to stand but, mesmerized, could not. For the next hour, he watched as she gutted the swan and cut off the head and black webbed feet.
<name>Agafya</name>	Agafya	Mabel	The days diminished. Light lasted just six hours, and it was a feeble light. [MASK] organized her hours into patterns—wash, mend, cook, wash, mend, cook—and tried not to imagine floating beneath the ice like a yellow leaf.
<name>Life</name>	Life	Life	Why does it always have to be somebody’s fault?” “Because it always is.” “No. Sometimes these things happen. [MASK] doesn’t go the way we plan or hope, but we don’t have to be so angry, do we?”
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Esther	She had thought them inedible, but [MASK] told her they were actually sweeter once they’d frozen and perfect for sauces and jellies. The late February weather had warmed to just below freezing. The sky was blue, the air was calm, and it was surprisingly pleasant to be outside.
<name>John</name>	John	Jack	But it is a wonderful feeling, to do work that really seems like work. [MASK] has transformed this untamed stretch of land that we call home into a flourishingfarm, and now I can claim a small hand in it as well.
<name>John</name>	John	Mabel	“It could have been anything,” he said. “No. No.” [MASK] was angry. “It was a little girl. You saw her, too. And there were her footprints in the snow.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mabel	“I feared those were going to freeze on the way over. I had to keep them up next to me, just to be sure.” She laughed and looked up at [MASK] as if finally taking notice of her.
<name>June</name>	June	Mabel	When she’s saddled with a screaming brat and a sinkful of dirty dishes, what then? Is she going to stick around long enough to be a wife and a mother?” [MASK]’s throat was swelling shut. She walked around the corner of the cabin, pretending to inspect the other wall.
<name>she</name>	she	Mabel	Outside, the air was clean and cool against her face, and she could smell the wood smoke from the chimney. She let the snow float around her, and then [MASK] did what she had as a child—turned her face to the sky and stuck out her tongue.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Esther	“Don’t go getting all riled up,” [MASK] went on. “Hear me out, because I’ve thought this through. I was wrong. I’ve gotten to know you pretty well, I’d say. Count you one of my dearest friends.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jack	His place was down just the other side of the tracks. I thought it was kind of pretty myself, but all the men in town teased him no end.” “Did it work?” [MASK] asked. “Can’t say that it did.
<name>Conklin</name>	Conklin	Garrett	This wasn’t a conversation he wanted to have. He was tired. His evening had been disturbed, and he wished he had stayed put at home in front of the wood-stove. But he faced [MASK]. “Yes. There was a girl.
<name>Galadriel</name>	Galadriel	Faina	He had the momentary notion that what stood before him was a mountain ghost, a bloodstained, snowy apparition. [MASK] was taller and, if possible, thinner than he remembered. Her fur hat and wool coat were covered in snow, and her hair hung like damp, fraying rope.
<name>her</name>	her	Faina	He hadn’t foreseen that she would be frightened of it. Weeks later, he was more confident in his choice. The puppy was thriving under her care, its black coat thick and shiny. It watched [MASK] closely with its one blue eye and one brown.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mabel	So [MASK] took the moonshine and held the cold glass to her mouth. The vapor alone was enough to make her cough, but she tipped it back and let the icy-hot liquid splash against her lips, and then she coughed and coughed and handed the bottle back while everyone laughed merrily.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Garrett	[MASK] shook his other glove to the ground and slid his hands beneath the wool, his rough skin catching on the silk lining. A wave of guilt shuddered through him, that somehow what they were doing was wrong, but it was too late.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	George	You didn’t leave it in the wagon, did you?” [MASK] smiled sheepishly, one hand behind his back. “Sorry, dear. Couldn’t help myself.” He smacked his lips. “It was mighty good, though.”
<name>He</name>	He	Jack	The knock came again and again, louder. At last, [MASK] went to the door and opened it. He had the momentary notion that what stood before him was a mountain ghost, a bloodstained, snowy apparition.
<name>packing</name>	packing	Jack	“Bedrolls?” “Didn’t I mention? We’re moving in. The boy and me. We might be a bossy, ill-tempered pair, but you can’t complain about free help.” “Help? With [MASK]?”
