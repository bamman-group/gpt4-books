<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Violet	“I know it,” [MASK] said. “Dont get mad. Its just the way the people look at the soldiers.” “Then whynt your folks run me off? or do something? or say something? If they dont like it.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Angelo	“Come on,” [MASK] said, “make like you’re workin.” He picked up his hammer and bent his back and let the hammer fall once of its own weight on the rock. “Come on,” he invited, “plenty room on this rock for two.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Stark	“We serve them all ways.” “Rare,” [MASK] said. When the two girls came in and locked the big metal door against the hubbub behind them, the smell of the frying porterhouses was already floating through the place. “Oh!”
<name>Isadora</name>	Isadora	Tony	Come on, lets go. I bought this champagne especially for you, [MASK], and its getting harder and harder to get, what with the war. And I want to christen it. Besides, we can be comfortable there. Its so muggy hot in here tonight.
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Warden	“You know,” the S/Sgt said as [MASK] buttoned the notebook into his other shirt pocket, “we feel pretty bad about this, Sergeant.” He looked around him, and then went on in a low voice.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Andy	“That guy kin really play a bugle. Whynt he never play? He should ought to be in the Bugle Corps.” “He was, you jerk,” [MASK] said scornfully. “He quit. He wouldnt play in this old Corps.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Prew	[MASK] moved his weight from one foot to the other and took one deep breath. “I was afraid you’d want me to go out for the squad, Sir,” he said. There it is, he thought, its out now, you’ve got it now.
<name>Circe</name>	Circe	Dana	That was always the greatest single blunder in this game. That put him in her power as [MASK] had never been in her power. She could make him do anything now, even become an officer, now that she was sure he did love her.
<name>Reiben</name>	Reiben	Leva	“AH they got to do is carry the water-cooled MGs for the beach out to the trucks and throw in [MASK]’s old field repair kit and they ready to go. “And,” he yelled, “they makin coffee and sandwidges in the kitchen.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Shush	“Now go to sleep.” “Why did you kiss me? You think I’m drunk, and that I wont remember. But I’ll remember. And I’ll come back.” “[MASK].
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Francis	“I think its broke in two places,” [MASK] said happily. “Hell, that ought to get me at least three whole weeks. Maybe more.” He broke off strangledly and got down on his knees, holding his left arm gingerly with his right, and vomited.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Warden	[MASK] turned his right knee in gracefully, with such ease that it seemed effortless, and caught her shin on his knee. Then he rose from the stool on his left leg, pushing it between her legs, and the struggling cursing girl was off balance and powerless.
<name>he</name>	he	Prew	She kept on looking at him, curiously, across the chair back. “Well,” she said. “You seer [MASK] stood up and stepped toward her. “Why in hell would 1 marry you?” he shot down at her.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Ike	The Warden could easily have simply reversed the order of the Company and started with the other end, or if he wanted, just have held the worst detail back until the very last, after partitioning off [MASK]’s labor for home use.
<name>Chief Bromden</name>	Chief Bromden	Warden	“She is good lookin. And she knows what its for.” “Is that right?” [MASK] said. “And I suppose you’ve made her.” “Hell, no, not me. I aint got enough stripes.
<name>Chris</name>	Chris	Paluso	“Wait’ll I get a bike,” [MASK] said apologetically, as they came down the stairs. He stood in the grass and waited. The sixty-five or seventy pounds of pack dragged at his back, already starting to cut in on the circulation of his arms.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Prew	I know I can.” [MASK] watched his eyes go a little crazy again, hungrily, like they always did at the mention of his great secret plan, but this time his eyes did not get the murderous suspicion in them that they always got out on the rockpile.
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Maureen	“She’s proud of her long hair,” [MASK] razzed, almost indifferently now, from force of habit. “She also says she’s a college grad, some coed school in the Middle West. She’s writin
<name>Unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Prew	“Werent you talking to him outside a while ago?” the lieutenant said. “Yes, Sir,” [MASK] said. “So were a lot of other people.” “You were sitting beside him though, weren’t you?”
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Milt	She looked back at the softly breathing water and took her lip between her teeth again. “You dont have to be gallant with me, [MASK],” she said. “If you’re bored already, or tired, why just say so.
<name>he</name>	he	Alma	He had, in fact, thought of a lot of things. But it made him mad to hear her say it out loud. “Maybe thats not such a bad idea at that,” he said. “Perhaps not,” [MASK] said coolly, “at first glance.
<name>Soldier</name>	Soldier	Prew	Some of them have to go on post—” he peered at his chronometer, “in thirty-seven minutes.” “Thats why we came up here, Sir,” [MASK] said. “Nobody has complained about it that I know of.”
<name>he</name>	he	Holmes	Then after you handled that and transferred, you could drop the whole damned boxing squad altogether. We’ll have better uses for your energy.” “Yes, I could do that,” [MASK] said, wondering if he wanted to quit coaching.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Georgette	It was a hell of a way to get close together. They heard [MASK] moving around getting up and, afterwards, went back out to the kitchen. Neither one of them cared much about lying in bed, afterwards, any more.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Stark	He handed him the bottle. “Right?” “Right.” “I went and got myself on [MASK]’s list too. Probly have to buy all my meals out now. Who am I to talk to you?” “How’d that happen?”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Warden	Shut that window before we both freeze to death.” [MASK] grinned at him slyly, his eyes squinted up. “Is the poor little delicate baby cold?” he said. “Is him freezin?” “Aw,” the clerk said.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Alma	“I hate to see you in such pain,” [MASK] said nervously. “Hell, this aint nothing,” he grinned sillily. “Lemme tell you about the time I broke my arm on the bum and dint have no dough to go to a doctor.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Prewitt	“All right then, move it. And dont call me Sir; only officers is called Sir. I’ll get [MASK]’s Service Record later on. When I need it. And when I’m goddamned good and ready. ”
<name>Vera</name>	Vera	Warden	“The time will be longer, and the plans are changed. And there will be the war. But we’ll see each other again.” “Sure we will,” [MASK] said. “I know that we will.” “We’ll meet again someday.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Prew	[MASK] said, pained, but he reached in his pocket and brought out one, a single tube, from the unseen pack. “Since when did I take you to raise?” “Whats a matter? You scared I’ll steal your lousy tailormades?
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Stark	he said disbelievingly. “Never.” “Ones with the little white sign and red letters on it and red streak of lightning under them?” “Not once.” “Tsk, tsk,” [MASK] said. “Where have you been?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pete	“You mean if it was the very last beer? and you wouldnt touch it?” [MASK] was trying hard to keep his craving off his face. “Well,” he said. “If it was the very last beer.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bloom	He lay down himself, and put his arms over his eyes and pretended to go to sleep, and the squad-room settled back into its interrupted noontime drowse while [MASK]’s arms and legs twitched wild signals to him to let them get up and carry him away.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Prew	“Shut up,” he said to [MASK], as the barman moved away. “You want to spoil it? I’m trying to induce this pizon for some preparation on the house.” “To hell with that pizon. I got thirteen-fifty we can use for preparation.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Prew	Thats the best I can do, honey.” “Yeah?” [MASK] said, feeling his throat close up as if he had swallowed alum. “Say,” he said. He had to work hard to get it said.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Angelo	“Thanks hell.” [MASK] was feverishly finishing up his first leggin, half hitching the string end. “I always know this guy was chickenshit,” he grinned. The Chief looked at them stolidly. “This is no twobit ass eating, kid.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Warden	“Or was it snort? I guess it was snort you said, wasnt it?” “Ah,” [MASK] said. “The Club. Why didnt I think of that? I got some papers its important for him to sign today.”
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Prew	I aint never. What if they threwn my ass in jail? for something I aint never done?” “I was only down there once myself,” [MASK] grinned. “You’re safe. They wont do anything to anybody anyway.”
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Warden	Much too highly to let a thing like a personal disagreement stop him from pushing your application, when he thinks you deserve it.” “And,” [MASK] grinned, “when it’ll be a feather in his bonnet if I make it.”
<name>Private Slovik</name>	Private Slovik	Warden	[MASK] had plenty of time and to spare, to pack the orderly room. But he did not have any time left to roll his full field pack or change into a field uniform. Or, if he did, he forgot it.
<name>He</name>	He	Warden	I’ll see you later on this afternoon. If you have any questions about that exam paper, you just ask me. I’ll try to answer them for you.” [MASK] sat up after he was gone and picked up the copy of the exam.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Prew	“I’ll call her. But I aint makin no promises not to go out if she asks me.” “I aint askin you any, am I?” [MASK] said. “All right, on them grounds I’ll chance it.
<name>he</name>	he	Maggio	“Sure. Here.” He pulled out the crumpled pack and gave him one, took the last one himself, and threw the crumpled pack in a commode. “Not if these is your last ones,” [MASK] said.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Prew	The clothes really made no difference; if the artist had left out two dozen lines it would have been a nude. Yet [MASK] found himself staring and staring, trying vainly to penetrate beneath the plane of the attire to the plane of the figure under it, as if it were three-dimensional.
<name>George</name>	George	Leva	and he remembered, now, how the other of the twin beds had looked with the woman’s shoes beneath it. “Let’s fall to on this work,” he reproved [MASK]. “I got that transfer comin in at nine-thirty.
<name>Mr. McAllister</name>	Mr. McAllister	Chief	If he was mean, and really had it in for me, I could figure it. But somehow I always feel like he dont have nothing against me really.” “Maybe he’s trying to teach you somethin,” [MASK] said. “What?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Angelo	“You’ll have worse than that scraped, if you dont get into these clothes and get out of here. . . . Listen,” he said. They both held their breath and listened, and [MASK] was suddenly very sober.
<name>he</name>	he	Prew	I dont know. Nothing especial I know of, why?” “Oh, I dont know,” [MASK] said, lamely, beginning already now to curse himself for a fool. “I cant figure him, thats all,” he said.
<name>Jackie</name>	Jackie	Warden	“I’m too damn good to waste my talents in this outfit, thats a cinch,” [MASK] bellowed at him, going on unabashed, lashing himself into the cathartic tirade, battering at the other like the stream from a firehose.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Karen	After all, I’m your husband. You cant hide things from me forever.” “My God,” [MASK] said, grinning, “if you surely dont sound like a page out of Hemingway. I’m not going to hide anything from you.
<name>she</name>	she	Karen	He blew his breath weakly, floating it aside, and looked at her, his body still shaking with the laughing and his eyebrows hooked up high. “Stop it,” [MASK] said. “Stop it, stop it,” her voice going off up high.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Violet	At least with [MASK] you had a woman. Maybe you could go back and see her and explain it, but even as he thought it he knew it would be useless, that it was past, that she had already found another soldier, or maybe even one of her own race.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Friday	“Cant you see he’s in a hurry? You always fiddlefuck around.” “Lay off of me,” [MASK] said, as they left. “You neednt ack like such a big shot.
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	Chief	“You take me,” [MASK] said, “for instance. I was a kid on the reservation. Bornd and raised there. And I wanted to be a jockstrap. The worst way I wanted to be one.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Sussman	“I’m goin to the sheds.” “Thats what I figured,” [MASK] said. He walked over to a window and stood looking out, his hands jammed in his pockets. “Son of a bitch,” he said.
<name>Olive</name>	Olive	Prew	“You see,” he said gently, “I have a theory about that. My theory is that homosexuality is the direct result of chastity in women.” “Then how do you explain the lesbians?” [MASK] countered.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Georgette	“He just feels guilty and he’s upset and a litde drunk. He’ll get over it by tomorrow.” “Maybe he ought to go back anyway?” [MASK] suggested. “If he went back, they’d only put him in the Stockade again, wouldnt they?”
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Warden	[MASK]? Yes you did, yes you did. But without having to get up to look he could feel the old world seeping steadily under the door that he had locked but forgot to calk. The world was up almost to the mattress now.
<name>Elmer</name>	Elmer	Prew	“Goddam right. I’m a logical guy. Its only common sense. Why you think I’m in this Bugle Corps?” “Because its logical,” [MASK] said. “Only, that aint the reason I’m in the army.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Angelo	Then on past the dark palm studded lawn on the Y itself, with the Black Cat across the street and also overflowing. A number of drunks lay passed out on the Y lawn. “But these tonight aint cruisers,” [MASK] said. “Tonight is regulars.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Angelo	“I feel like a collegekid must feel goin in to take his first big exam,” he explained. “Probly. Me, I wount know.” “Me neither. Remind me to ask one some time and see.” “Theres the whistle,” [MASK] said.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Georgette	“Let alone got back home. The whole town’s a madhouse. Trucks, buses, laundry trucks, private cars, every vehicle that can move.” “We met a guy at the hospital who’s going to write a book about it,” [MASK] said.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Prew	Well, what do you know,” he said. “Both broke. I thought I could maybe make you for a couple bucks.” “We could play for jawbone,” [MASK] grinned. “I cant. I owe my payday out already.
<name>her pregnancy</name>	her pregnancy	Holmes	Then, still thinking about it, he realized with a shock why she hadnt seen through it. She had been too busy concentrating on making her own convincing to him, to notice his. He hoped she didnt have any trouble with [MASK].
<name>her</name>	her	Maggio	He turned to [MASK] with a sweet almost boyish smile. “Sometimes I think if I didnt buy you things you would drop me like a hot rock. Perhaps that is why I love you so.” “Ah, you know that aint
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Karen	“Now you just fix yourself lunch the way you would if I wasnt here and I’ll eat whatever you have for yourself. Now. Hows that?” “I can fix you a toasted cheese sandwich,” [MASK] said weakly.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	O’Hayer	And Warden who thought quite a while before he called looked at his hole-card twice and then he almost didnt call, so he had no trips. On the last card [MASK] missed his ace and dropped out, indiffer- ently.
<name>He</name>	He	Angelo	And what difference does it make who pulled the trigger?” [MASK] frowned again. “None, I guess. When you put it that way.” “Well, would you say the Christian martyrs were wrong?” “Of course not.”
<name>George</name>	George	Sal	“Okay,” he’d said, “and thanks, [MASK], thanks a lot.” He had bent his face back to the strings, feeling warm himself, because he too had made two friends today. . . .
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Karen	“Oh,” he said, guiltily. “Hello. I didnt know you were home. I just came in to change my uniform.” [MASK] picked up the brush and went back to her hair. “The car is parked outside,” she said.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Alma	He was sitting behind the table of the glassed-in breakfast nook and could not get out. “I want to know what you plan to do?” [MASK] said after she had got a cup of his coffee that was still heating on the stove.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Stark	So dont bother me with theory. This is practical. And he got up quickly off the bed and went downstairs to make out [MASK]’s promotion, before it had a chance to answer. They had the luck.
<name>he</name>	he	Slade	He waited until they had gone on ahead and followed them down the path at a distance with his light. They did not turn their light on. “God damn,” [MASK] muttered thickly. “God damn.
<name>trouble</name>	trouble	Japs	And you cant do no good anyway. You want to be heroes, you’ll get plenty chances later; from now on. You’ll probly have [MASK] right in your laps, by time we get down to beach positions. “Stay off the porches.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Prew	“To hell with him,” [MASK] said grimly, plodding on. “He said the pass. The pass it is.” He looked over at the Stockade rock quarry cut back into the side of the hill on the right of the curve.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Prew	“I aint got a cent,” [MASK] said. “Not a red cent. To hell with it. It’d take you all goddam night to win enough to have a stake to hit the sheds.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Willard	“Come heah! Now! This man’s hot as a forty-five shootin downhill,” he said when [MASK] came up. “Claims you deliberately usin pans to make more work and get him in bad. What about it?”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Prew	“I jockstrap a little bit myself.” [MASK] laughed wildly. “Have nuther beer,” the Chief said. “Naw sir, my turn to buy one.” “Plenty here. Help yourself. You earned it.”
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	Alma	“Has he been down there to see you again? Has he? Answer me, goddam you?” “No,” [MASK] said; “that was the first time, when he told me you were in hock. He’s only been there once.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Prewitt	[MASK] quit looking and stopped sprinting and started the skirmisher’s zigzag, wanting to grin. They would measure up all right. Except for that one mistake of not getting out of the light, they were doing fine. And doing it fast. Where the hell was that sandtrap?
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Dana	We couldnt get by with it. How would I explain my being gone for a whole month? [MASK] suspects something now, and if—” “Let him suspect, the son of a bitch. He’s been true to you, hasnt he?”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Karen	“Maybe I’ll make it my business.” “No,” [MASK] said, “I dont think you will.” “I suppose now you want a divorce.” “I hadnt really thought about it. One way or the other.”
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Prew	He was grinning with great joy and he sang the song in that whining nasal, his eyes half shut, his head back and on one side, almost drowning out the rest. When it ended, he took [MASK]’s empty beercan that had its top cut off to serve as a glass and filled it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pete	Except for one thing, one tiny fly in the ointment, it was perfect. He suspected all along they had gone together longer than she said, but all along he had hoped it wasnt true. “Jesus!” [MASK] said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Prew	I’m gettin thirsty.” “In a moment, my pet. Some day,” he said to [MASK], “as you grow older, you will find imagination sometimes produces a truth that is greater than any fact.”
<name>Williams</name>	Williams	Prew	“What the hell do you guys want? This aint no goddam all night restaurant. You suppose to eat when you go on post or when you come off. And thats all.” “We dont want to eat,” [MASK] said.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Warden	“You can have it, Sergeant, but you’ll have to do the work yourself.” [MASK] laid the papers on the table and got the bottle from the cupboard, thinking I can match that, baby. “You want one too?” he said.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Angelo	[MASK] shrugged. “They all there anyway. Hell, there aint enough queens to go around, any more. I’m thinkin of organizin a union, by god. Got to pretect us professionals from the steadily encroaching amatoors and scabs.”
<name>Hawkeye</name>	Hawkeye	Leva	“What’ve you been doin? Studyin psychology?” They listened for a moment to her knocking on the Orderly Room door and when there was no answer, heard the door squeak open. “I dont need to know psychology to know that much,” [MASK] said.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bloom	Two more weeks, [MASK] thought. Just two more weeks. Then no more fights nor training until December when the Bowl season opened. It was almost too wonderful to believe. He was basically at heart a peaceful man, and the prospect of five whole months of peace stretched away like a bonanza.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Warden	Cursing savagely, [MASK] unlocked his footlocker and flung back the lid. A book in the tray had a slanting hole drilled right through its center. His plastic razor box was smashed and the steel safety razor bent almost double. Savagely he jerked the tray out and threw it on the floor.
<name>Private</name>	Private	Warden	I was just going to mention it myself, as a matter of fact.” “Yes, Sir,” [MASK] said. “Still, of course,” the Lt Col said carefully, “you realize I have absolutely no sayso with the board’s verdict.”
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Fatso	The boys in Number Three loyally covered these up for him and finally set up a system of guard duty in which there was always one man awake at night to keep an eye on him. But finally he went after [MASK] himself one day in the messhall.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Prew	You think I argue with them? Like hell I argue with them. I just listen and nod my head and let it go and ask them for me a nuther drink.” “I guess I just aint cut out for this kind of life,” [MASK] said.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Warden	He stopped suddenly, aware he had let loose a secret he had not intended to divulge, aware that [MASK] had needled him into it. His face a mixture of start and sullenness he swung back to his desk in silence.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Red	Every day for two weeks now. You just dont understand it, [MASK].” “Maybe not,” the other said. “I aint no tempermental genius. But I understand somethin else. I’m a good bugler and I know it.
<name>Babe</name>	Babe	Warden	[MASK]’s records and player were gone, also his $120 Brooks Bros, suit, saddle-stitched Forstmann jacket, and the white dinner jacket and tux pants he had bought but never worn yet, together with all of his uniforms.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Prew	He inspected his forest with weighty deliberation and uprooted one of the trees. He pushed it over to [MASK] with all the formality of bestowing a medal. “What I hear,” he said in his slow careful way, “I’d say you done pretty fair.
<name>Brinker</name>	Brinker	Pete	“And what the hell do you do?” [MASK] said indignantly, half running to keep up with the long loping strides as they moved across the quad. His voice was so choked with hurt, after the warm comradely time he had envisioned, that he seemed almost to be crying.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Prew	Nobody knows how I hate these goddam hats. I wouldnt wipe my ass on these goddam hats,” he said, wiping his face, and put it back on and grinned. The grin, [MASK] thought, there was something about the grin.
