<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Beth	And now never would. Chapter Three [MASK] took a forty-five-minute shower, used half a bottle of body wash, and nearly melted the cheap wallpaper off the bathroom walls because she kept the water so hot.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	V	The vampire didn’t look happy to see any of the others, either. [MASK] threw them into reverse and gunned it. The conversation kept up in spite of the music, but the atmosphere had changed. Which made sense, considering there was now a live grenade in the car.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Butch	[MASK] flopped around, half-awake. The bed wasn’t his. The thing was a twin, not a king. And the pillows weren’t his. They were supersoft, as if his head were on Wonder bread. Sheets were likewise way too fine.
<name>She</name>	She	Marissa	But then, he hadn’t been thinking of her. [MASK] recurled her hand, making that fist again. She didn’t want him back. What she wanted was for him to have a taste of the pain she’d been through.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fritz	Her head dropped. “My lord, I can feel your p—” “I’m perfectly fine.” She hesitated a moment. And then quietly disappeared. Ten minutes later he came up to the drawing room. “[MASK]?” he called out.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Darius	In the process [MASK]’s envelope poked him in the side, and he took it from his waistband. There was a strip of ink on the front, which he assumed was his name. He cracked open the flap.
<name>Xcor</name>	Xcor	Butch	She considered what he’d said, trying to ignore the panic that rose every time she thought about the transition she was supposedly about to go through. “When you went after [MASK] like that... Surely he’s not a ... whatever, a lesser.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Butch	[MASK] cursed. “Those stars. I know you can get them on the Web, but they can be bought locally, right?” “Yeah, through martial-arts academies.” “We’ve got a couple of those in town.”
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Beth	“—but she’s going in and out of consciousness—” And then [MASK] jerked up from the floor and snatched the phone out of his hand. “I’m going to die....” “The hell you are!” he yelled.
<name>She</name>	She	Tohrment	[MASK] was obviously using caller ID and avoiding his ass. Hell. He sucked at apologies, but he really wanted to get this one out on the table. Because it was going to be a doozy. He took the cell phone with him to bed and leaned back against the headboard.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Wrath	[MASK] swallowed his surprise. No one worried about him. Vampires and humans alike feared him. His race worshiped him. But none were ever concerned for him. He didn’t know how to handle the sentiment. “No. It won’t hurt me.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Wrath	[MASK] casually tossed the towel back into the bathroom and walked over to the couch. He sat forward, elbows on his knees. “He was an aristocrat from the old country before he became a warrior. He’s ... he was my friend.
<name>Excitement</name>	Excitement	Anticipation	Even more to the point, however, if you wanted to catch a shark, you didn’t fish in freshwater. He had to go to where the vampires were. [MASK] shot through him. He’d been brushing up on his torture techniques.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cherry	Busy drinking, he was taken by surprise when the first dart popped out of the gun and went into his shoulder. His immediate instinct was to protect his food, so he hauled [MASK]’s body behind some mangled trash cans.
<name>Roarke</name>	Roarke	Blondie	“Hey, are those the spinach crepes I like so much?” [MASK] said, going for the tray. “Yes, Sire.” “Hot damn.” The other men clustered around the butler, taking what he offered. Along with cocktail napkins.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Beth	“Ranch house with a black Hummer in front.” [MASK] repeated his words, pressing the robe into his wound. “We’re in the barn. Come fast! He’s bleeding.” A low growl came from the left.
<name>Tris</name>	Tris	Beth	She put her fingertips to her lips. When she looked down at them, she saw red. The figure dropped his hand. As if he knew what the stain meant. [MASK] slammed back into her body. It was like being catapulted and landing on gravel.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Beth	[MASK] was sleeping soundly on her side. When he went over and kissed her, she stirred. “I’m going upstairs,” he said, stroking her cheek. “But I’m not leaving the house.”
<name>Worm</name>	Worm	Butch	People call me [MASK], though.” He stuck his hand out. Then retracted it, rubbed it vigorously on his pant leg, and offered it again. She lost her nerve. Touching him was too much, and she took a step back.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Wrath	[MASK] went back to the first lesser and knelt over the body. It writhed as he went through its pockets and took all the ID he could find. He was about to stab it in the chest when he heard a shotgun go off. Chapter Twenty-nine
<name>Dante</name>	Dante	Wrath	He scooped her up in his arms and carried her out through the courtyard. He was so going to nail that bastard. [MASK] crossed his arms and leaned back against the wall in the drawing room. The brothers stood around, waiting for him to speak.
<name>She</name>	She	Butch	One thing was for sure: Her attacker had made a hell of a mistake when he’d picked her. The entire police force was going to be gunning for that fool when they found out who he was. And [MASK] had a big mouth.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tohr	she asked. [MASK] finished his beer. “I think you’d better talk to him about that.” Which was not a no. A sick feeling of disappointment set up shop in the middle of her chest, and she went back into the kitchen.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Fritz	The writing ran together, a meaningless, blurry scrawl he had no hope of deciphering no matter how hard he squinted. “[MASK]!” he called out. The butler came rushing in. “Read this.”
<name>He</name>	He	Wrath	More shifting on the bed. “I liked warming you,” she said huskily. “I liked the feel of you.” Dark hunger curled in his gut, cramping up his stomach. [MASK] stopped breathing. Waited to see if it would pass.
<name>She</name>	She	Marissa	[MASK] didn’t understand all the vernacular he used, but the gist of what he was thinking finally got through to her. Appalled, she threw her spine into a straight line. “I beg your pardon!” He stared at her, jaw set hard.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Wrath	When she was finished, she tilted her head to one side, clasping her hands together. “You do it justice. The whole red-and-black combo really works with your hair. [MASK]’s going to pass out when he sees you.”
<name>He</name>	He	Wrath	And it didn’t take a genius to figure out what happened once he closed the door. A lock clicked into place, and her heart seized up. “So about my father,” she said briskly. [MASK] walked past her, taking off his jacket.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Wrath	Or that we’d lived in the same town all my life but he never came to see me, wasn’t even curious enough to know what I looked like.” “He knew.” [MASK]’s voice was very near again. “He knew you.”
<name>Rehvenge</name>	Rehvenge	Havers	He hadn’t been able to attend the lectures because they’d taken place during the day, but his doggen had been allowed to take notes and hand in his examinations. [MASK] had read all the texts, corresponded with the professors, and even attended seminars and talks that were scheduled at night.
<name>Vishous</name>	Vishous	Havers	He knew well that horrified, impotent expression. He’d been wearing it himself as he’d watched his shellan die. [MASK] washed his face and went out into the hall. The brothers and the human looked up at him. “He has survived the surgery.
<name>Damon</name>	Damon	Wrath	“You know it’s the only way he’ll feed. He has to stay alive somehow. And in spite of the rumors, he’s never killed the humans he feeds from before. I don’t know what happened with those two prostitutes.” [MASK] cursed.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Rhage	Got three jars to collect.” “Nice tally.” “Would have been more if this little gift hadn’t come by air mail. No wonder you like those stars so much.” [MASK] moved his hand around, as if he were tying a knot.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Wrath	“Let me see your hands!” [MASK] caught the man’s scent and smiled. Lust had been replaced with aggression, and the fighting urge was as strong as the sexual one had been. The guy was full of juice tonight. “I said, halt and hands!”
<name>Damon</name>	Damon	Wrath	The hell he would. God help that human who’d hurt her. [MASK] was going to rip the guy’s limbs off and leave him to bleed out in the street. He dropped a soft kiss to the healing bruise and then drew his tongue down her neck.
<name>Zsadist</name>	Zsadist	Wrath	“I’m only hanging in until she goes through the change. That’s it.” “Yeah, sure.” When [MASK] growled deep in his throat, the other vampire shrugged. “I’ve never seen you dress for a female before.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Beth	“How did you know about the orgasms?” [MASK] asked abruptly. He stiffened. And so did his cock, just at hearing the word leave her lips. Moving his body around to make some room in his pants, he wondered if he could avoid answering her.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Havers	If ever she is ready to hear you.” As the door slid shut with a hiss, [MASK] closed his eyes. Oh, dear God, the pain in his chest. The pain of deeds that could never be undone.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Tohr	He simply couldn’t bear the potential for tragedy inherent in his being responsible for so many. Didn’t [MASK] know he wasn’t good enough? Wasn’t strong enough? He’d let his parents die, had acted as a feeble weakling, not a worthy male.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Butch	So pure. So clean. He felt like he should brush his teeth and shave before saying one more word to her. What the hell was she doing hanging out with those lowlifes? [MASK]’s heart cramped with the idea of how useful she’d be to them.
<name>Ragnar</name>	Ragnar	Wrath	Their band of brothers, a tight circle of strong-backed warriors who traded information and fought together, was of the same opinion. [MASK] was off the chain when it came to the business of vengeance, and he hunted their enemies with a single-minded purpose that bordered on the insane.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Beth	Her hand was on her face, as if she were embarassed. Those eyes, [MASK] thought with wonder. She’d been staring at an identical pair in the mirror every day of her life. Her mother. She brushed her forefinger down the glass.
<name>He</name>	He	Butch	The human’s finger moved her hair aside, and then his whole hand brushed against her shoulder. His palm was warm. Solid. Strong. She lifted her eyes to him. “I can’t breathe,” she whispered. [MASK] nearly fell over.
<name>Drake</name>	Drake	O’Neal	While his two daggers were stripped from their holster, he stared down at the cop, thinking how much he was going to enjoy ripping that thick throat open with his teeth. He leaned forward, leading with his head. He couldn’t help it. “[MASK], be careful!”
<name>Ripley</name>	Ripley	Wrath	She measured each one of them without having much idea what the readouts meant. Provided that none of the alarms were going off, she had to imagine if was okay. The sound came again. She looked down at [MASK]. And shot to her feet.
<name>Delilah</name>	Delilah	Wrath	But the closer he got to [MASK], the crazier her eyes became. She pulled her wrist away from the man’s mouth, ready to defend him. “Easy, girl. We’re not going to hurt him.
<name>Clara</name>	Clara	Havers	She removed the jacket and laid it on the empty chair next to her. “You know. [MASK], I would like to try it. Drinking is no longer palatable to me, either.” A delicious relief, a feeling of possibility, overtook him.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Havers	There was a lot of shallow coughing, like there were lumps being cleared out of throats. He knew what that felt like. He had a knot in his own. “My brothers—” At that moment. [MASK] came through the door.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Butch	Not like she had the night before with ... Now was a hell of a time to be thinking about that other man. When [MASK] pulled back, his eyes were hooded. “I’m not doing it for you, am I?” She laughed softly.
<name>Damon</name>	Damon	Wrath	“Hate this,” the brother said. “I know.” [MASK] moved the sticky, blood-soaked hair out of the vampire’s face. “We’re going to get you home.” “Didn’t like seeing you shot.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Billy	“This have something to do with your nose?” “Maybe. I dunno.” “Well, I’m glad you came to me, son.” Another pause. “You can trust me, [MASK].”
<name>Connor</name>	Connor	Tohr	“Good enough to try to tell me what to do.” The brothers laughed in a rush. The sound was one of relief. Of pride. Of love. “Either of you need anything?” [MASK] asked.
<name>She</name>	She	Beth	“Is he your lover?” [MASK] almost laughed. God, he sounded jealous. “I’m not going to answer that.” “Why?” “Because I don’t have to. I don’t know you, I don’t owe you.”
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Jose	Rubbed his achy eyes. “Goddamn it, I can’t believe she’s protecting him.” “Man, I never saw that one coming. She finally picks someone—” “And he’s a total lowlife.” [MASK] looked over.
<name>Dylan</name>	Dylan	Wrath	Smell me. I’m telling the truth.” [MASK] breathed deep. He caught the scent of outrage, a tangy flare in his nose like someone had blasted him with citrus air freshener. But there was no anxiety, no emotional subterfuge.
<name>Simba</name>	Simba	Wrath	“Man, you should have seen her when we came into that barn. She was standing over his body, ready to take the cop and me on with her bare hands if she had to. Like [MASK] was her cub, you feel me?”
<name>He</name>	He	Began	He turned away. [MASK] to stride off. He didn’t like the idea of leaving her, but what else could he do? If he got his ass shot and killed, who would look after her? And he couldn’t let himself get thrown in jail.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wrath	Then she lifted [MASK]’s head up and pressed the wound to his mouth. His body jolted like it had been hooked up to a car battery. “All right, let’s move him,” said the man who’d taken charge.
<name>Phury</name>	Phury	Phury	[MASK]’s vow of celibacy was strong, but why put him in the path of temptation? Zsadist? He hadn’t even considered that option. The scar down that brother’s face would have scared the shit out of her.
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Marissa	[MASK] was leery of the human, especially considering his size. She’d heard so many stories about them. How they hated the vampire race. How they hunted her species. But this one seemed to be taking great pains not to frighten her.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Dick	“So?” [MASK] leaned over her desk. She was wearing a loose crew-neck shirt, so there was little for him to see. He straightened. “So good job. Work a little magic on him. See what you can get.
<name>Anita</name>	Anita	Beth	He felt himself get stretched between the two needs. Sex. Blood. Both hers. “Are you running away?” she whispered. It was mostly a question. Only a little bit of a taunt. “Be careful, [MASK].” “Why?”
<name>Jake</name>	Jake	Butch	She headed for the door. “My mistake.” [MASK] grabbed her arm. “Who the hell was at your apartment last night?” She wished she knew. “No one. Like I said, my mistake. I’ll see you later.”
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Beth	“More,” she demanded. “I want more.” “And you’ll get it.” His whole hand disappeared under the black lace. She cried out as he came into contact with her hot, wet core. “But [MASK]?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Butch	When she caught sight of his car, she fluffed her auburn hair and walked over to him. He put the window down and she leaned in, kissing him on the lips. “I haven’t seen you for a while. You lonely, [MASK]?”
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	V	It was covered with tattoos, dense, intricate designs that ran down the back of it, onto the palm, and around each finger. It must have hurt like a bitch to have done. “[MASK]?” “Yeah?” “What’s doing with the tats?”
<name>James</name>	James	Billy	The sun was just going down, the shadows long on the grass and the gravel drive. As [MASK] shut the double doors, she caught a last glance of the darkening sky and then watched as he slid home a series of thick bolts on the doors.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Marissa	He staggered to the bathroom, calling out for [MASK] with his mind. He lurched over the toilet, but there was nothing much in his stomach. He’d waited too long, he thought. Ignored the signals his body had been giving him for quite some time.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Wrath	What a bummer. She had to smile as she dried off. [MASK] had been so proud to put that ring on her. He’d told her it was a gift from someone whom she’d meet tonight. At her wedding. She paused with the towel.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Butch	[MASK]’s deep drawl seemed totally out of place in her apartment. “How did you get into the lobby?” she said as she shut the door. “I picked the lock.” “Was there any particular reason you chose this building to break into, Detective?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Billy	We should put out knives, too. And go get the can of gasoline from the garage as well as the butane blow torch that’s next to the Hummer.” [MASK] slapped her one more time. And then did as he was told.
<name>He</name>	He	Butch	“I’m going to die....” “The hell you are!” he yelled. She gripped the front of his shirt. Her body shook, sweat staining the front of her T-shirt. “I need him.” [MASK] stared into her eyes.
<name>He</name>	He	Wrath	“Why wouldn’t I?” With a pathetic groan of relief and gratitude. [MASK] lurched for her again. Except she didn’t let him get anywhere near her body. She pushed him back down and gripped his wrists, bringing his arms over his head.
<name>Zsadist</name>	Zsadist	Wrath	That made him feel better. Like he might end up breaking her heart or something. Man, this date thing was a really bad idea. Just where did he think he was taking them with all the hearts-and-flowers shit? [MASK] bared his fangs.
<name>Styx</name>	Styx	Rhage	As always, his black driving glove, used to keep his left hand from inadvertently making contact with anyone, was in place. Which was a good thing. A goddamned public service. [MASK] followed, his cocky attitude dialed down in deference to what had brought the brothers together.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Wrath	“[MASK]?” she said softly. He reached out for his wineglass, his hand not closing around it until the crystal hit his palm. “What?” He brought the glass to his lips, but put it back down. “
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Marissa	“I never wanted—” “Me,” she’d whispered. “I know.” “[MASK]—” “Please don’t say the words. I couldn’t bear to hear the truth from your lips, even though I know it well.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Beth	She could actually feel his eyes on her body as he followed, as if he were touching her with his hands. “You’re right,” he said. “I would kill to have you.” [MASK] wheeled around, pointing a finger at him.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Wrath	“There was only one. The recruit that you and I met the night of your mating. I went back and stabbed the body while you were being operated on. Got his jar from the house.” [MASK] shook his head. “There were two.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Josd	“How you feelin’?” “Better.” “Come on. I’m giving you a ride to work.” “Thanks, but I want to walk.” [MASK]’s jaw set like he wanted to argue, so she reached out and touched his forearm.
<name>He</name>	He	Wrath	A male who stayed with her during those torturous, mercifully rare times when she was fertile. Who eased her terrible cravings with his body for as long as the needing period lasted. [MASK] did none of that for or with her. Especially not the last part.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Riddle	[MASK] sucked in a breath, as if he were about to dive into a pool. “My dad’s in D.C., as usual. So last night I had a few friends over. We were smoking some blunts—” ' “You shouldn’t do that.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Forgotten	No one worshiping, no one chanting, no history to be kept. I am useless. [MASK]. “But far worse,” she went on, “I see the future, and it is grim. The survival of the race is not ensured.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Wrath	“I’m going to take her downstairs,” [MASK] said. “Oh, yes, please,” she murmured. “I’d really like to go down . .. stairs.” He put his arm around her, and he knew how affected she was by the way she melted into his body.
<name>He</name>	He	Wrath	How was he going to explain what was about to happen to her? And what she’d have to do to live through the change? He had a feeling she wasn’t going to be too happy about the news flashes. [MASK] thought back to his own transition.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Butch	Wide blue eyes met his. “What are you talking—” [MASK] slammed him again. “I’ve got a positive ID on you. From the woman who you tried to rape.” “That wasn’t me!” “The hell it wasn’t.
<name>He</name>	He	Butch	Her eyes Hashed, and she licked her lips. "I want more of you.” [MASK] stopped breathing. And wondered if she was thinking about his blood. Looking into her beautiful face, he relived what it felt like to gel pushed back into that chair.
<name>Severus</name>	Severus	Wrath	“That’s my fault,” [MASK] said, splaying his arms out as if to protect her. “I didn’t adequately prepare her. She meant no offense.” A laugh—low, warm, and feminine—came out of the robes.
<name>Boone</name>	Boone	Butch	[MASK] reached for the bedside table. Next to his watch was a Red Sox hat, a gold lighter, and a black driving glove. “Five thirty.” “Cool.” The vampire rolled away. “Don’t crack the drapes for another two hours.
<name>Marissa</name>	Marissa	Beth	[MASK] stared at him, trying to read through his sunglasses. searching for some softness, something she could connect to. But the dark lenses shut her out of his eyes completely, and the tight lines of his face gave her nothing to go on.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Riddle	And then you didn’t make it to class.” As [MASK] slid into the booth, he didn’t look so hot. His eyes were still black and blue, and exhaustion hung off his face like loose skin. “Someone’s after me, sensei.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Beth	“With whom?” She met his eyes with such deliberate calmness, he knew the next thing she said was going to be a lie. “No one special.” Yeah, right. “What happened to the man last night, [MASK]?
<name>Rehvenge</name>	Rehvenge	Wrath	And it was a shame to kill someone who was able to die as a warrior would. Without fear or hesitation. Such males were few and far between, be they vampires or humans. The cop’s mouth started moving. He was trying to speak. [MASK] leaned down.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Wrath	“And he ran out of time.” There was a long silence. “Who was my father?” she breathed. “He was as I am.” And then [MASK] opened his mouth. Fangs. He had fangs. Her skin shrank in horror.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Wrath	When the silk fell back, a blinding light was revealed, as if her bones glowed and her skin were translucent. The moment she touched the water, a rainbow sprang from the contact, filling the white courtyard. [MASK] hissed in shock as his vision suddenly cleared.
<name>Rhysand</name>	Rhysand	Wrath	[MASK]’s arms were nearly snapping her in half, his massive body a cage around hers as he drank. For the first time she felt every hard line of him. Including what she realized must be an erection, something she’d never been anywhere near before.
<name>Elendil</name>	Elendil	Beth	Just as she’d put the ring in his hand for [MASK]. “You are right,” she said softly. “I had hoped to be closer to you. Your father and I, we were bonded, and these lonely centuries have been long and hard.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Beth	And if by some miracle she lived through the night, he was getting downgraded to Tender Vit-tles. [MASK]’s neck jacked back up as she met the man’s steady, feral gaze. She couldn’t see the color of his eyes through the glasses, but his stare burned.
<name>Kael</name>	Kael	Wrath	[MASK] bowed his head and spoke the words of his mother tongue, the syllables rising and falling with his breath as he paid tribute to his dead. When he finished speaking, he knelt down onto the slab, feeling the stones cut into his flesh.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	leelan	“You’re sure about this, [MASK]?” “There’s safety in numbers, right?” He nodded. “But more exposure, too.” “We’d be in very good company, though. There is nobody I’d rather have protecting us than these wonderful men.”
