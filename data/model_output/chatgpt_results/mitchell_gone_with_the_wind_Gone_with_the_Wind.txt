<name>God</name>	God	Melanie	She was lonely and she could never remember being so lonely before. Perhaps she had never had the time to be very lonely until now. She was lonely and afraid and there was no one to whom she could turn, no one except [MASK].
<name>Abner</name>	Abner	Scarlett	Some of the feeling of bitter hatred the women bore [MASK] for her share in the tragedy was mitigated by the knowledge that her husband was dead and she knew it and could not admit it and have the poor comfort of claiming his body.
<name>Mrs. Waddle</name>	Mrs. Waddle	Mammy	Then, for no apparent reason, she began to sob whenever [MASK] waddled out of the room, carrying the lamp. From this she progressed to wakening in the late night hours, screaming with terror, frightening the other two children and alarming the house.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Ellen	Then she could permit herself to be kind and gentle, as [MASK] had been, and thoughtful of other people and of the proprieties, too. She would not be driven by fears, day and night, and life would be a placid, unhurried affair.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Pork	Once he brought home a rooster which he said he found in the woods. The family ate it with relish but a sense of guilt. knowing very well [MASK] had stolen it, as he had stolen the peas and corn.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Scarlett	It's a poor person and a poor nation that sits down and cries because life isn't precisely what they expected it to be. Why don't you pick up some enterprising Carpetbagger to work for you, [MASK]? The woods are full of them, God knows.'
<name>Baloo</name>	Baloo	Able	[MASK] was a shrewd, grave giant, illiterate, kind of heart, older than the other boys and with as good or better manners in the presence of ladies. There was little snobbery in the Troop. Too many of their fathers and grandfathers had come up to wealth from the small farmer class for that.
<name>her</name>	her	Scarlett	He went his way, amused, contemptuous, impervious to the opinions of those about him, so courteous that his courtesy was an affront in itself. To [MASK], he was still an enigma but an enigma about which she no longer bothered her head.
<name>him</name>	him	Tara	She must think of something to talk about, yet it was so hard to talk. Her mind was leaden with defeat and all she wanted was to lie back in this warm blanket and say to herself: 'I won't think of [MASK] now.
<name>Curley's wife</name>	Curley's wife	Rhett	[MASK], I'm so sorry about what I—I said to you that night—you know—at Rough and Ready. I was—oh, so very frightened and upset and you were so—so—' She looked down and saw his brown hand tighten over hers. '
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Scarlett	She had cast down her eyes demurely, her heart beating with wild pleasure, thinking the happy moment had come. Then he had said: 'Not now! We're nearly home and there isn't time. Oh, [MASK], what a coward I am!'
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Scarlett	'How closely women clutch the very chains that bind them! You think the Hindu custom barbarous—but would you have had the courage to appear here tonight if the Confederacy hadn't needed you?' Arguments of this character were always confusing to [MASK].
<name>She</name>	She	Scarlett	Almost a year.' 'An aeon, I'm sure.' [MASK] was not sure what an aeon was, but there was no mistaking the baiting quality of his voice, so she said nothing. 'Had you been married long? Forgive my questions
<name>he</name>	he	Ashley	I'd been and that it was all over.' He stopped and looked through her and beyond her, even as [MASK] had often done, seeing something she could not see. And she could only stare speechless at his brooding face. '
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Honey	What would your mother say?' 'Well, they didn't know it was my bedroom.' 'But they'd suspect it was your bedroom and that's just as bad. [MASK], you mustn't do things like that.
<name>Tara</name>	Tara	Tara	And I'm going to have pretty clothes and all of them are going to be silk—' 'All?' 'All' she said shortly, not even troubling to blush at his implication. I'm going to have money enough so the Yankees can never take [MASK] away from me.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	India	He's implicated in this and is probably explaining to the Yankees at this very minute. Get some other doctor. Are you afraid to go out alone at night?' . 'No,' said [MASK], her pale eyes glittering. 'I'm not afraid.'
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Pork	[MASK] lit one lamp and three candles and, with the pompous dignity of a first chamberlain of the royal bedchamber lighting a king and queen to their rooms, he led the procession up the stairs, holding the light high above his head.
<name>she</name>	she	Scarlett	'I can never make you understand.' They fell silent and looked at each other. Suddenly [MASK] shivered and saw, as if coming back from a long journey, that it was winter and the fields were bare and harsh with stubble and she was very cold.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Scarlett	The mask was gone. 'You must not say these things, [MASK]! You mustn't. You don't mean them. You'll hate yourself for saying them, and you'll hate me for hearing them!' She jerked her head away.
<name>Louise</name>	Louise	Scarlett	In an impulsive rush of feeling, she said: '[MASK]'s lucky to have a husband who's so nice to her!' 'You think so? I'm afraid she wouldn't agree with you, if she could hear you.
<name>her driver</name>	her driver	Archie	'Oh!' she thought. 'I hope no one else has been raped! If the Ku Klux lynch just one more darky the Yankees will wipe us out!' And she spoke to [MASK]. 'Pull up. Something's wrong.'
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Scarlett	In other days, [MASK] would have been bitter about her shabby dresses and patched shoes but now she did not care, for the one person who mattered was not there to see her. She was happy those two months, happier than she had been in years.
<name>Captain Hook</name>	Captain Hook	Johnnie	'You are a rare scoundrel!' she cried furiously to [MASK] as he stood at the wheel, his hat pushed back from his lowering brow. 'And you can just hand over to me the price of my supplies. In the future.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Scarlett	'These are the most beautiful hands I know,' he said, and he kissed each palm lightly. 'They are beautiful because they are strong and every callous is a medal, [MASK], every blister an award for bravery and unselfishness.
<name>he</name>	he	Rhett	No one, looking at her now, would suspect that poverty and want were standing at her shoulder. It was so important that [MASK] should not suspect. He must not think that anything but tender feelings were driving her.
<name>Willie</name>	Willie	Ashley	Always putting himself in the other fellow's shoes.' To her, there was never but one fair side to an argument. Sometimes, there was no understanding [MASK]. 'Let's don't be too hot-headed and let's don't have any war.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ellen	Then, wheels ground sharply on the gravelled driveway, and the soft murmur of [MASK]'s voice dismissing the coachman floated into the room. The whole group looked up eagerly as she entered rapidly, her hoops swaying, her face tired and sad.
<name>John</name>	John	Ashley	What have I done with my life, up till now? It's time I made something of myself—or went down through my own fault. I've been your pensioner too long already.' 'But I'm offering you a half-interest in the mill, [MASK]!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Scarlett	When I'm wearing a new bonnet, it seems like all the figures I know leave my head.' 'Figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that one,' he said. '[MASK], you get prettier all the time!'
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Melanie	Then she heard the creaking of the bed as a heavy body fell upon it and, soon after, the sound of boots dropping to the floor. After an interval, [MASK] appeared in the doorway but, strive though she might.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Scarlett	[MASK] did take pleasure in it. She bullied the negroes and harrowed the feelings of her sisters not only because she was too worried and strained and tired to do otherwise, but because it helped her to forget her own bitterness that everything her mother had told her about life was wrong.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Pork	I've got a present for you.' A little interest flickered in [MASK]'s eyes as he blew his nose loudly but it was more politeness than interest. 'You remember that night you got shot robbing somebody's henhouse?'
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Frank	In a way, it's been on my conscience. Lots of folks have told me: "Oh, forget about it, [MASK]," but I can't. I couldn't hold up my head if I thought I'd done what wasn't right.
<name>her husband's name</name>	her husband's name	Ashley	She could not mention money matters to an outsider. Somehow, despite what he made from the mill, she and [MASK] never seemed to have enough money. It worried her that they saved so little. She did not know where the money went.
<name>New York</name>	New York	Rhett	The faintest intimation from him, in the orchard, that some day things might be different and she would never have thought of going to [MASK]. A word of tenderness, even a parting caress when she was getting on the train, would have held her back.
<name>He</name>	He	Frank	Well,' she shrugged, 'he can moan all he likes. I'm going to tell him that he may be willing to stay poor for friendship's sake but I'm not. [MASK] will never get anywhere if he doesn't get up some gumption.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Ashley	'He was there and he asked most kindly after you, as did his sisters, and said they hoped nothing would keep you from the barbecue tomorrow. Ill warrant nothing will,' he said shrewdly. 'And now, daughter, what's all this about you and [MASK]?'
<name>He</name>	He	Rhett	She had made many sharp remarks about his cowardice and the memory of them made her feel guilty. 'Well! And why haven't you ever told anybody about your service? You act as though you were ashamed of it.' [MASK] looked her squarely in the eyes, his face blank.
<name>George</name>	George	Frank	[MASK]'s just too soft-hearted, and people take advantage of him. Why, if he'd collected half this money, he could have bought the sawmill and easily spared me the tax money, too.'
<name>Dagny</name>	Dagny	Scarlett	She sat with her bare feet dangling, watching the play of muscles on his brown chest, her terrors forgotten. 'And while we are on the subject of real estate, [MASK],' he said, 'I am going to build a house.
<name>Koko</name>	Koko	Dilcey	Her face was puckered in the sad bewilderment of an old ape but there was determination in her jaw. She spoke a few soft words to [MASK] who nodded kindly, as though an unspoken armistice existed in their old feud.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mammy	Oh, yes, I know all about lacing. No, I won't call [MASK] to help you and have you lock the door and skulk here like the coward you are.' 'I'm not a coward,' she cried, stung out of her fear. '
<name>Sula</name>	Sula	Sam	It was the white man who lay in the road where [MASK] had knocked him down. Maddened by terror, she lashed the horse again and again and it struck a gait that made the buggy rock and sway. Through her terror she was conscious of the sound of feet running behind her
<name>Mattie</name>	Mattie	Melanie	I shall die!' [MASK] said nothing, but patted the foot in its awkward home-made shoe which hung from the stirrup. Her head was low. 'And don't pat me! I can't stand that either.'
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Melanie	No one ever told her anything really shocking or scandalous, for her spinster state must be protected even if she was sixty years old, and her friends were in a kindly conspiracy to keep her a sheltered and petted old child. [MASK] was like her aunt in many ways.
<name>Uncle Sam</name>	Uncle Sam	Scarlett	'You don't want to change your mind about what I said last month? There's nothing like danger and death to give an added fillip. Be patriotic, [MASK]. Think how you would be sending a soldier to his death with beautiful memories.'
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Scarlett	'I don't know. But don't look so frightened, [MASK]. Our charming new governor is a good friend of mine. It's just that times are too uncertain now and I don't want much of my money tied up in real estate.'
<name>Pheoby</name>	Pheoby	Mammy	[MASK] was a country negro but she had not always been a country negro and she knew that no chaste woman ever rode in a hired conveyance—especially a closed carriage—without the escort of some male member of her family. Even the presence of a negro maid would not satisfy the conventions.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Yankees	If you're bound to gad about, I'll drive you. I hates niggers—[MASK] too.' He shifted his wad of tobacco to the other cheek and, without waiting for an invitation, sat down on the top step. '
<name>Dr. Roylott</name>	Dr. Roylott	Rhett	She gulped and choked and began coughing but he pushed it to her mouth again. She swallowed deeply and the hot liquid burned suddenly in her throat. 'I think she's better now, gentlemen,' said [MASK], 'and I thank you very much.
<name>Malfoy</name>	Malfoy	Rhett	'[MASK], you are joking!' She grabbed his arm and felt her tears of fright splash down on her wrist. He raised her hand and kissed it airily. 'Selfish to the end, aren't you, my dear?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Melanie	[MASK] held on to the back of her chair for support, almost crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known before. 'Oh, ladies!' she cried, pleading. 'Please, let me finish!
<name>William</name>	William	Frank	He said he wanted the town to rest his men and horses in,' said [MASK]. 'And he rested them there till the middle of November and then he lit out. And he set fire to the whole town when he left and burned everything.'
<name>terrifying</name>	terrifying	Ashley	Then she heard the fretful hungry wail and always—always there was a startled moment when she thought: 'Why, there's a baby in the house!' Then she remembered that it was her baby. It was all very bewildering. And [MASK]!
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Mammy	To think of a modest, well brought-up young woman— Well, I told you it would be fun, didn't I?' 'Oh, you are impossible!' she cried in wrath, not caring if [MASK] did hear. '
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Prissy	[MASK] climbed in and took the baby in her arms. The wagon was very small and the boards about the sides very low. The wheels leaned inward as if their first revolution would make them come off. She took one look at the horse and her heart sank.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Scarlett	Contemplating the suave indifference with which he generally treated her, [MASK] frequently wondered, but with no real curiosity, why he had married her. Men married for love or a home and children or money, but she knew he had married her for none of these things.
<name>Grandfather</name>	Grandfather	Grandpa	But [MASK] wouldn't go home. He said frankly that he preferred the Captain's swearing and bullying to his daughter-in-law's coddling, and her incessant demands that he give up chewing tobacco and launder his beard every day.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Scarlett	[MASK] stood on the landing and peered cautiously over the banisters into the hall below. It was empty. From the bedrooms on the floor above came an unending hum of low voices, rising and falling, punctuated with squeaks of laughter and, 'Now, you didn't, really!'
<name>Marilla</name>	Marilla	Beau	'Me?' she questioned, puzzled. 'Oh, you mean for [MASK].' He picked up his hat and rose. He stood for a moment looking down at the plain, heart-shaped face with its long widow's peak and serious dark eyes.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Scarlett	Shall I let myself cry? Wouldn't that seem more natural?' He said quickly: 'My God, [MASK], you can't mean that you—' and his hands closed over hers in so hard a grip that it hurt.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Puss	[MASK], don't you be hurt at what your poor old father said and him not meaning a thing and not understanding a thing! Sure, you're a fine well-meaning girl. I'm sure.' 'And wanting to take me home in disgrace.'
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Pork	Merely holding herself erect required an effort of willpower and she talked as briefly as possible, dispensing with the usual forms of courtesy her mother had always taught her to use with negroes. She began asking questions so brusquely and giving orders so decisively [MASK]'s eyebrows went up in mystification.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rhett	Don't you think, even if it was a lie, that it would be appropriate for you to say "I love you, [MASK]," even if you didn't mean it?' What was he driving at, she wondered, becoming more confused.
<name>he</name>	he	Rhett	You are closer to the old country than I thought.' How pleasant it would be to shout at him: 'I did not marry for convenience!' But unfortunately, [MASK] had her there and any protest of injured innocence would only bring more barbed remarks from him.
<name>Lord Henry</name>	Lord Henry	Ashley	The wintry wind swept her damp ankles and she shivered again, but her shiver was less from the wind than from the dread his words evoked in her heart. 'But, [MASK], what are you afraid of?' 'Oh, nameless things.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Scarlett	'Times never change when there's a need for honest work to be done,' stated the sharp-eyed old lady, refusing to be soothed. 'And I'm ashamed for your mother, [MASK], to hear you stand there and talk as though honest work made white trash out of nice people.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Puss	'No,' she cried vehemently, jerking away. 'It's lying you are, and I'm proud of it. I'm glad there's pride in you, [MASK]. And I want to see pride in you tomorrow at the barbecue.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Rhett	Now that I've—we've got money, I'm going to be the greatest lady you ever saw!' 'I shall wait with interest,' he said. More exciting than the people she met were the frocks [MASK] bought her, superintending the choice of colours, materials and designs himself.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Scarlett	Just tell him politely but firmly that his presence and his disloyal talk are distinctly unwelcome at your house.' By this time [MASK] was boiling, ready to rear like a horse at the touch of a strange rough hand on its bridle. But she was afraid to speak.
<name>captivity</name>	captivity	Reconstruction	Now, at the end of the road, there was nothing left of that girl. Hunger and hard labour, fear and constant strain, the terrors of war and the terrors of [MASK] had taken away all warmth and youth and softness.
<name>Alonso</name>	Alonso	Scarlett	When I was in prison, I thought: "When the war is over, I can go back to the old life and the old dreams and watch the shadow show again." But, [MASK], there's no going back.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Carreen	[MASK], sitting on a hassock under the big lamp, was deep in the romance of a girl who had taken the veil after her lover's death and, with silent tears of enjoyment oozing from her eyes, was pleasurably picturing herself in a white coif.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Scarlett	He sounded as though delighted at her flurry. '[MASK], you do like me, don't you?' That was more like what she was expecting. 'Well, sometimes,' she answered cautiously. 'When you aren't acting like a varmint.'
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	India	They all loved her but they thought her the sweetest, most pliable of young women, deferential to her elders and without any opinions of her own. 'How dare you, [MASK]?' she questioned in a low voice that shook. 'Where will your jealousy lead you?
<name>him</name>	him	Rhett	For the dozenth time, she ran out on to the porch but this time she did not go back to her futile packing. She sat down. It was just impossible to pack anything. Impossible to do anything but sit with hammering heart and wait for [MASK].
<name>Ashley</name>	Ashley	111	Even if he hasn't actually heard anything this afternoon, perhaps he's noticed something, sensed some excitement in the Wilkes family. If I can just see him privately before supper, perhaps [MASK] find out the truth—that it's just one of the twins' nasty practical jokes.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Ashley	'I don't, either!' she cried hotly. 'But I just can't see why you hate [MASK] so much and that's the only explanation I can think of.' 'Well, think something else, pretty charmer, for that's the wrong explanation.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Pork	Then feet shuffled up the back-porch stairs and into the passageway leading to the main house, stopping in the hall just outside the dining-room. There was a brief interval of whispering, and [MASK] entered, his usual dignity gone, his eyes rolling and his white teeth agleam.
<name>they</name>	they	Will	He looked as though he understood her rudeness and that was annoying. She didn't want to hear bad tidings about her own family from an outsider, didn't want him to know of her ignorance of what had happened. Why hadn't [MASK] sent her the full details?
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Scarlett	She leaned her head against the bowed neck of the horse and cried. 24 The bright glare of morning sunlight streaming through the trees overhead awakened [MASK]. For a moment, stiffened by the cramped position in which she had slept, she could not remember where she was.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Darling	'[MASK],' she said, 'don't you get upset. I understand and it was a brave thing you did last night and it's going to help the hospital a lot. And if anybody dares say one little word about you.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Melanie	By a series of limping jerks, she pulled the body down the hall toward the back porch and, pausing to wipe her forehead with the back of her hand, glanced back toward [MASK], sitting against the wall hugging her thin knees to her bare breasts.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rhett	I shall find some other charming lady with green eyes who appreciates my taste.' 'Oh, you shan't! I'll die if I don't have it! Oh, please, [MASK], don't be mean! Let me have it.' '
<name>Aunt Polly</name>	Aunt Polly	Brent	Both boys yelled with laughter. 'Ma's a card!' said [MASK] with loving approval. 'You can always count on her to do the right thing and not embarrass you in front of folks.' '
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Gerald	can they go on fighting if they have only this stuff to eat?' The meal was gay enough and even [MASK], presiding absently at the head of the table, managed to evoke from the back of his dim mind some of the manner of a host and an uncertain smile.
<name>her</name>	her	Ellen	I wasn't raised that way. Mother—' She stopped and swallowed. She had avoided thinking of [MASK] all day but she could no longer blot out her image. 'I often wondered what she was like. You seemed to me so like your father.'
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Melly	Any man who does not think our Cause is just and holy should be hanged! I don't want to hear of you two girls ever even speaking to him again— For Heaven's sake, [MASK], what ails you?'
<name>her mother</name>	her mother	Melanie	She felt as if she had been in this steaming, dark, sweating place all her life. She wanted very much to scream every time [MASK] did, and only by biting her lips so hard it infuriated her could she restrain herself and drive off hysteria.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Scarlett	But to [MASK], newly emerged from the chrysalis of widowhood, all the war meant was a time of gaiety and excitement. Even the small privations of clothing and food did not annoy her, so happy was she to be in the world again.
<name>Herman</name>	Herman	Starving	Of course they think the nigger is just as good as they are!' But for those Georgians who had turned Republican for personal gain, there was no excuse. '[MASK] is good enough for us. It ought to be good enough for you,' was the way the Old Guard felt.
<name>Dill</name>	Dill	Mammy	dat Ah doan know whut 'tis.' 'Well, it's paint, if you're so curious! Face paint. Don't stand there and swell up like a toad. Go on.' 'Paint!' ejaculated [MASK]. 'Face paint!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Scarlett	It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much, the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. [MASK], before the war, life was beautiful.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rhett	She was only a—well, but she was a pretty good sort at that. It's not an easy way'to die. I—' 'Why, [MASK]!' she cried, startled out of her misery at the emotion in his voice.
<name>Mae</name>	Mae	Scarlett	He really gave you your start.' [MASK] swung on him, furious words on her lips. 'And the money has made you very, very happy, hasn't it, darling?' he asked, poisonously sweet.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Melanie	But not this! Never this! That this could happen to us all, this wrecking of old ways, this bloody slaughter and hate! [MASK], nothing is worth it—States' Rights, nor slaves, nor cotton.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Melanie	She heard his uncertain footsteps leaving the door and his helpless voice saying her name over and over above her head. There was a swift pattering of feet racing up the hall from the kitchen and [MASK] burst into the room, her eyes wide with alarm.
<name>they</name>	they	Ellen	So she passed this milestone as she had passed others before it—with a sigh that she was not as [MASK] would like her to be, a shrug and the repetition of her unfailing charm: 'I'll think of all this later.'
<name>Ralph</name>	Ralph	Charles	She was naturally embarrassed and shy, and in agony lest they be overheard. [MASK] felt a surge of masculinity such as he had never experienced, for this was the first time in his life that he had ever embarrassed any girl. The thrill was intoxicating.
