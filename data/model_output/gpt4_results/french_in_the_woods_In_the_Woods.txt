<name>he</name>	he	Sam	“He wants you to cover it up?” I asked, keeping my voice down and hoping [MASK] would take the hint. “I’d say that’s what he was driving at, yeah,” he said, with heavy sarcasm.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Cassie	I don’t remember very many specifics about that evening, and according to [MASK] neither does she. I can remember some of the things we talked about, a few piercingly clear images, but I could give you almost none of the actual words.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Donnelly	“That’s just brilliant. All right. [MASK]’s story’s barely enough for us to charge her, never mind convict her. We need to get a confession. What age is she?” “Eighteen,” I said.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Red	“Apparently someone thought they were more than just a nuisance,” I said. “This last time in court, a few weeks ago, Move the Motorway got an injunction, but [MASK] says it’ll be thrown out on appeal. He’s not worried.”
<name>She</name>	She	Cassie	A flash of the bedroom slapped me straight across the face—white walls with posters of horses, yellow curtains blowing, a dream-catcher hanging above the bed—and I knew I had had enough. “I’ll wait in the car,” I said. [MASK] gave me a quick glance.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Katy	My mother would have got herself caught within a week, even with you people in charge. I mixed juice with detergent, or cleaning things, or whatever I felt like that day, and I told [MASK] it was a secret recipe to improve her dancing.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jonathan	“Why?” [MASK] asked. I thought I caught a flicker of wariness in his eyes, but his back was to the window and it was hard to tell. “They’ve been mentioned in the course of our investigation.”
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Sam	This is me kicking you. Metaphorically, for now.” “Look, give me one more week. If by the end of next week you think I’m still not handling this, I’ll swap with [MASK]. OK?”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	O’Neill	“I didn’t say a word to him after the lineup, just thanked him and said I’d be in touch. I want to let him worry about it for a while.” “Oh, that’s underhanded, [MASK],” I said gravely.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Cassie	[MASK] held out her hand for my glass, got up to refill them. “Not exactly,” she said, at the fridge. “I knew a psychopath once.” Her back was to me, and if there was an odd undertone in her voice I didn’t catch it.
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Cassie	I walked to work without bothering to move my car. It cost me a ridiculous amount of money in the meter, but it was the kind of sunny, buoyant day that encourages extravagance. [MASK] was already at her desk with a pile of paperwork.
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Sean	I felt curiously light-headed, as if my feet were paddling effortlessly a foot or two above the ground. The archaeologists threw small swift glances at me as I passed: not inimical, exactly, but perfectly, studiedly blank. [MASK] was troweling earth away from a patch of stones.
<name>she</name>	she	Heather	You know I just get colds so easily.” “I understand,” I said reassuringly, and [MASK] disappeared back into the kitchen, presumably to add horse-sized capsules of vitamin C and echinacea to her frenetically balanced diet. I went into my room and closed the door.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Cassie	It might not be fair to make him suffer for it.” “I guess I was.” I could hear the humiliation, stark and uncamouflaged, in [MASK]’s voice. “I was the ... I was always the one who initiated everything.”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Dolores	“But, sure, maybe I did the right thing. You’re a fine woman, do you know that? You’re too good for me. A hundred times too good. Maybe even a thousand. Amn’t I right, [MASK]?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sam	[MASK] laughed, relaxed and rummaged for the corkscrew. “I swear, that wasn’t my fault. My first three cases all came in at five in the evening; I rang him just when he was getting home.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mark	I caught [MASK]’s startled glance in the rearview mirror. “Can I have a roliie?” she asked him, twisting round to lean between the seats. “How long is this going to take?” he said. “That depends,” I told him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Peter	Her face was red and her hair was tangled, clips hanging off sideways. “Leave me alone.” [MASK] was still on top of the wall. “Are you going to boarding school?” he demanded.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Damien	I nudged her foot, under the table; she stood on mine. “How’s the dig going?” [MASK]’s face lit up; he looked almost dazzled with delight, unless dazzled was just his normal expression. “It’s been amazing.
<name>he</name>	he	Damien	For finds. So I got one of them, and I ... I put it over her head and kept it twisted till. . .” “Till what?” I said. “Till she stopped breathing,” [MASK] said at last, very softly.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Cassie	“This is bloody pointless.” “Your irritation is important to us,” [MASK] droned, looking at me upside down with her head tipped backwards over her headrest, “and will be exacerbated in rotation. Thank you for holding.”
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Rosalind	“If you want a lawyer—” “I think I’ll see them sooner than that, actually.” [MASK] smoothed her skirt over her backside and sat down, with a little moue of distaste at the plastic chair.
<name>He</name>	He	Cassie	He ... he ended it a couple of weeks ago. For good, this time.” “Oh? Why?” “I don’t want to talk about it.” “Well, that’s not really your choice.” [MASK] took a breath.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Damien	“I just don’t want her to get in any trouble.” “Then you’re doing the right thing by telling us all the details. OK?” [MASK] sighed, a small, tired sigh with something like relief in it. “OK.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cassie	I’ll make sure they give you something voice-activated, so you can’t forget to hit Record.” “No,” [MASK] said. “No recorder. I want a transmitter, feeding to a backup van less than two hundred yards away.”
<name>Essun</name>	Essun	Rosalind	She was flashing her unarmored spots to draw the blows; she was deliberately letting [MASK] hurt her, maul her, delicately peel back layers of pain to feed on them at her leisure. I felt sick to my stomach.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Sam	[MASK] looked relieved. “A bunch of different companies. Most of them don’t exist, not really; they’re just holding companies, owned by other companies that are owned by other companies. That’s what’s been taking all my time—trying to find out who actually owns the bloody land.
<name>Clarice</name>	Clarice	Cassie	“Without a caution, none of it will be admissible.” “So I’ll caution her.” “And you think she’ll keep talking? I thought you said the girl’s not crazy.” “I don’t know," [MASK] said.
<name>Laurent</name>	Laurent	Cooper	The fine crooked Vs of her eyebrows, the tilt of her nose, the full, childish curve of her lip: the last time I had looked into that face, it had been empty and blood-smeared on [MASK]’s steel table.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Rob	“[MASK], it’s just me." I couldn’t hear her. I could barely see her; her face looked like a stranger’s, unreadable and risky. I wanted to be almost anywhere else in the world.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Damien	[MASK] glanced up tentatively. “Almost ten; it’s his tenth anniversary at the end of October. Can I . .. when we’re finished here, can I, like, get bailed out?” “Bail can only be decided by a judge.
<name>nothing</name>	nothing	Mammy	I asked her if anything had happened, if something was bothering her, but she said no.” Something dark leaped in my mind—home early, No, [MASK], nothings wrong—but it was far too deep to catch.
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Cathal	This just felt like more of the same. I was going out with a girl for a while around the same time, sure, and she went with [MASK], not a bother on her—I think she only went out with me in the first place because he was taken.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jonathan	“How did she die?” [MASK] demanded, still staring fixedly out the window. The words were blurred, as if his lips were numb. “What way?” “We won’t know that until the doctors have finished examining her,” I said.
<name>Deirdre</name>	Deirdre	Twelve	It seemed inconceivable that I had actually got up one morning and put them on. All I could see was the pathos of them—how small the T-shirt was, the Biro Mickey Mouse on the toe of one runner. [MASK] had seemed terrifyingly grown up, at the time.
<name>her</name>	her	Cassie	He was actually her second cousin and happily married, but he was heartily protective of [MASK] and had no objection to gazing adoringly at her for an evening if it would smooth her career path. After that, the rumors faded and people more or less left us to our own devices, which suited us both.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Cassie	[MASK] asked. She leaned across the table and laid her fingertips on his arm. “The ones who confess. The ones who do their time. Seven years later, or whatever, it’s over; they get out of jail and they can start again.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Devlin	[MASK] looked down, saw his hand on her shoulder and moved it away, startled. It stayed frozen in midair, as if he had forgotten what to do with it. He knew, by that point; of course he knew.
<name>Trumbull</name>	Trumbull	Mark	I had cast my vote for [MASK] not out of sheer contrariness, as you might think, nor because something about him annoyed me in ways I didn’t care to explore. I suppose when you come down to it, given the choices available, I simply wanted it to be him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	The sea is several streets away and there was no way I could have heard it, but I imagined I did all the same. In my memory, we spent a million nights in [MASK]’s flat, the three of us.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Cassie	He accepted a slice, in the end, and sat wretchedly picking off the pineapple and nibbling on it, his head whipping from [MASK] to me and back as if he were trying to follow a tennis match from too close by.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Damien	He took a sip of his 7-Up and then looked up at us, all transparent blue eyes and bewilderment, and shook his head. “OK,” I said. “Fair enough. There’s something I want you to look at, [MASK].”
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	O’Kelly	I was wet and cold and fed up and I wanted to go home and have a long bath and a hot whiskey; I did not want to deal with whoever this was. “Get the fuck in here,” said [MASK]. “Now.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Cassie	They can’t live with themselves. We’ve seen it, over and over.” “It’s not pretty,” [MASK] said softly. “We know what happened, the guy knows we know, but he’s scared to confess.
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Heather	“Oh. Well, I suppose it can wait till then. Is that my cheese?” I extricated myself from [MASK]—not without difficulty—and ate my sandwich, which unsurprisingly didn’t undo the effects of the Guinness.
<name>Miller</name>	Miller	Sophie	Blood was caked on her nose and mouth and the tips of her front teeth. The breeze whirled the soft, curling fronds at her hairline. Her hands were covered in clear plastic bags, tied at the wrists. “Looks like she fought,” [MASK] said.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Cassie	I tried to read and stuff, but I couldn’t, I couldn’t concentrate, I was so . . .” His teeth were chattering again. “Shhh,” [MASK] said gently. “It’s over now. You’re doing the right thing.”
<name>Donnelly</name>	Donnelly	Sam	[MASK] scraped at an imaginary stain on the knee of his trousers. I cracked my knuckles, until I realized how irritating this was, and tried to ignore the intensity with which I wanted a cigarette. The tech did the Irish Times crossword.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	I know I stayed for dinner—a studenty dinner, fresh pasta and sauce from a jar, hot whiskey in china mugs. I remember [MASK] opening a huge wardrobe that took up most of one wall, to pull out a towel for me to dry my hair.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Katy	“So, as I was saying, I decided that someone needed to stop [MASK] from getting too full of herself. It really should have been my mother and father’s job, obviously; if they had done it, I wouldn’t have had to.
<name>She</name>	She	Cassie	[MASK] sat back on the table and looked at me. There was an expression in her eyes that I couldn’t fathom. “Do you think,” she inquired eventually, “that that litde sap came up with this all by himself?” “I don’t know
<name>Adela</name>	Adela	Cooper	She was watching the trees flash past on the roadside; I could only see the back of her head. “But so does, for example, the mother—if it turns out [MASK] was wrong about the rape, obviously.
<name>Orla</name>	Orla	Sean	“I can’t work without my fucking trowel!” “Borrow one.” “Spare over here,” someone yelled. A trowel flew spinning from hand to hand, light spiking off the blade, and [MASK] caught it and settled down to work, still grumbling.
<name>Chappie</name>	Chappie	Mark	That day you guys came for [MASK], that was the first time I needed it, but everyone was going, ‘No, I haven’t seen it, uh-uh, wasn’t me.’ ” “It’s identifiable, then?
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Adam	“I’m off the case, then,” I said finally and stupidly. My lips felt numb. I had a sudden hallucinatory image of dozens of journalists yapping and screeching at the door of my apartment building, shoving microphones in my face and calling me [MASK] and demanding gory details.
<name>Curran</name>	Curran	Cassie	The familiar, uneventful routine of the interviews had settled my mood considerably ([MASK] calls these preliminary background interviews the nuthin’ stage of a case: nobody saw nuthin’, nobody heard nuthin’, nobody did nuthin’), but still I felt something zip down my spine as we stepped into the wood.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Cassie	There was still debris strewn on the table: crumpled napkins, Styrofoam cups, a splatter of dark liquid where someone had banged down a fist or shoved back a chair. “All righti” [MASK] said, on something between a gasp and a laugh.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cassie	The way he is, he could shout a story from the rooftops and no one would believe a word of it.” He extracted something tiny and silver, holding it carefully between finger and thumb, and passed it to [MASK].
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Rosalind	But she wasn’t acting, and [MASK] smelled it. “Well,” she said, and I heard the tiny smirk in her voice, “I can’t say I’m surprised. He certainly doesn’t talk about you like a lover.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Sam	“She totally believed that people were, like, queuing up for her autograph.” “Actually,” [MASK] said, “she’d every reason to believe that. Plenty of people had asked for her autograph after the fund-raiser.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Damien	“Sorry.” [MASK]’s eyes ricocheted, disoriented, from her hand to her face to mine. “What I can tell you,” I said, pointing at him with a crust, “is that we’re taking this case very, very seriously.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Katy	“I promise we’ll take you to [MASK] as soon as we can, but at the moment you can’t see her. It’s simply not possible.” She stared at me, red-eyed, her mouth hanging open. “My baby, ” she gasped.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Rosalind	[MASK]’s eyes were starting to turn suspicious, and, while there was not a chance in hell that I was going to go into the whole Knocknaree thing, the last thing I wanted was to lose her trust after all this.
<name>Alaska</name>	Alaska	Mark	I almost left then. I actually went back to the clearing, shook the dead leaves off my sleeping bag, and started rolling it up. If I’m honest, the only thing that kept me there was the thought of [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	I didn’t even want to think about the intolerable possibility that it had something to do with [MASK]: she wouldn’t have, I thought, surely to God she wouldn’t have asked him to have a word with me? “Whiskey would be great.”
<name>She</name>	She	Cassie	“And their personalities?” [MASK] glanced up at me; the wind flattened her hair sleek as a seal’s against her head. Occasionally when we go for walks she links a hand through my arm, but I knew she wouldn’t do it now.
<name>Strike</name>	Strike	O’Kelly	It’ll be one of the most delicious buzzes of her life. She won’t be able to resist.” “She can say whatever she bloody well likes,” [MASK] said. “Without a caution, none of it will be admissible.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rosalind	Possibly this is a testament to my stupidity, but I still had the capacity to be taken aback by the note in [MASK]’s voice, something far beyond contempt: rejection, utter and impersonal. “I’m really not worried about him.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Jess	I was really scared because she got so mad but I was mad too and I said no I dont beleive her I think it just makes me sick. She says 111 be sorry + [MASK] isnt allowed to talk to me.”
<name>Cordelia</name>	Cordelia	Cassie	This is one of [MASK]’s quirks, especially odd in a detective. She omits things, eludes questions with open mischief or so subtly you hardly notice her doing it, spins misleading phrases with a conjurer’s expertise; but I had never known her to lie outright, not even to a suspect.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Devlin	“There’s not a chance she’ll press charges. She thinks it was basically all her own fault for sleeping with him in the first place.” “Let’s go talk to [MASK],” I said, starting the car.
<name>Connolly</name>	Connolly	Cassie	and we’ll buy you dinner as well,” I said. “What’ve we got?” “White female, ten to thirteen,” [MASK] said. “No ID. There’s a key in her pocket, looks like a house key, but that’s it.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Cassie	Same as the blood from the old case. OK, so it’s tentative, but at least it’s a link.” “Yeah,” I said. I could feel [MASK] listening; I turned my shoulder to her. “That’s great.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cathal	When [MASK] said she fancied me, too, wanted to be with me, I couldn’t believe my luck.” “This didn’t strike you as—well, slightly odd, to say the least?” “Not as odd as you’d think.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sam	But maybe the guy was haunted by the first time, figured he might feel less guilty if he made sure the family got the body back this time round. And [MASK]’s right: what are the odds of two different child-killers in the same place?
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jessica	“Nobody can possibly understand what this is like. I don’t know why we came in. [MASK] can’t be bothered to tell you what she saw, and you obviously don’t think that matters. We might as well go.” I couldn’t lose them.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jessica	She’d survived it for years, she said, she could survive for six more, till [MASK] was old enough to move out. But I couldn’t let her just stay! That time he fractured her skull, she was in the hospital for two months.
<name>Cassidy</name>	Cassidy	O’Kelly	If we find a motive, then that’s out.” [MASK] snorted. “Fair enough. I’ll put the lads onto the interviews. Get back in there and get me a cast-iron case. And, Ryan”—grudgingly, as I turned to leave—“well done.
<name>Tina</name>	Tina	Rosalind	“If she wasn’t involved?” He shrugged. “Because. We didn’t tell anyone we were going out.” “Why not?” “We just didn’t. [MASK]’s dad would’ve been mad.” “He didn’t like you?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	It really was as simple as that: we planted seeds without thinking, and woke up to our own private beanstalk. At break time I caught [MASK]’s eye and mimed a cigarette, and we went outside to sit cross-legged at either end of a bench, like book-ends.
<name>Mac</name>	Mac	Damien	“Good. Keep him that way.” We went back in and set about making [MASK] nervous. “OK, guys,” I said, pulling up my chair, “time to get down to business.
<name>ME</name>	ME	JAMIE	LET [MASK] STAY, red block letters across squared paper. My mother trying helplessly to reason with me while I sat cross-legged and unresponsive on the sofa, picking at the skin around my fingernails, my stomach squirming with excitement and terror at my own daring.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Sean	“[MASK],” I said. My voice sounded like it was coming from somewhere behind my ears. He didn’t hear me, but when I took a step closer my shadow fell across him, faint in the gray light, and he looked up.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Cassie	We could damage her for life here, do you understand that? Until we have something a whole lot better than a minor coincidence, we leave that girl the hell alone.” “Minor coincidence?” [MASK] shoved her hands into her pockets, hard.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	The woman teaching them had white hair pulled back in a tight bun, but her body was as spare and straight as a young athlete’s; she was wearing the same black outfit as [MASK] and holding a pointer, tapping at the girls’ ankles and shoulders and calling instructions.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Maddox	I felt a wave of anger rising inside me, sheer fury with a thick, tangled quality to it. “No, [MASK]. No. Don’t even try to pull that. If anything, it’s the other way around.
<name>Gould</name>	Gould	Rosalind	And if that was in itself deceptive, remember, I told you that, too: I warned you, right from the beginning, that I lie. It is difficult for me to describe the degree of horror and self-loathing inspired by the realization that [MASK] had suckered me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Cassie	Because you can tell that old bitch I took the stereo off him after the last time, so if she’s hearing anything it’s the voices in her head.” “No, no, no,” [MASK] said easily. “Nothing like that.
<name>her</name>	her	Cillian	“I should get back to my girlfriend,” I said, “sorry again for spilling your drink,” and turned away from the startled pink O of her mouth and the confused, reflexive flare of belligerence in [MASK]’s eyes.
<name>Maeve</name>	Maeve	Cassie	Now that my daughter’s after buying me the microwave, I do make six dozen at once and put them away in the freezer till I need them.” [MASK] made a flatteringly big deal of choosing her scone, took a huge bite and said, “Mmm.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jonathan	[MASK] thought for a moment, his eyes hooded and intent. “No. Like I said, we were all in some kind of shock anyway, and this was more than we could handle. I was frozen, couldn’t have moved if I’d wanted to.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Sam	[MASK] laughed. “Nothing but the best for our boy.” At 8:23 he had called his brother-in-law to arrange a round of golf for Sunday afternoon, with a few manly jokes thrown in.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	It was—you could smell it... I kept having to stop ’cause I thought I was going to throw up.” He looked, I swear, as if he expected sympathy. “It must have been awful,” [MASK] said, sympathetically. “Yeah.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Cassie	“I did nothing wrong.” [MASK] wasn’t the only one who was losing weight. It had been well over a week since I had eaten an actual meal, with food groups and everything, and I had been vaguely aware that when I was shaving
<name>Jennifer</name>	Jennifer	Rosalind	Otherwise it’s hearsay, and that’s not admissible in court.” [MASK] stared blankly, taken aback. Finally she nodded. “Well,” she said, “of course, if that’s what you need, then ... I just hope ...”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	I don’t want to scare you, but—” [MASK] shook her head. “And what, never leave the flat again? I can’t afford to start getting paranoid. I’ve got good locks, and I keep my gun beside my bed.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Andrews	“We don’t need to do the voice lineup now. If it suits you better to come back and do it this evening or tomorrow morning, outside business hours, I’ll set it up then. How’s that?” [MASK] pouted.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cassie	“I swear, that wasn’t my fault. My first three cases all came in at five in the evening; I rang him just when he was getting home.” “Uh-oh,” [MASK] said.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Rosalind	I am aware that, within an impressively short time of meeting me, [MASK] had me coming to heel like a well-trained dog: running up and down stairs to bring her coffee, nodding along while she bitched about my partner, imagining like some starstruck teenager that she was a kindred soul.
<name>Kenny</name>	Kenny	Kenny	What I saw transformed with a click like a shaken kaleidoscope. I stopped falling in love with her and started to like her immensely. I looked at her hoodie jacket and said, “Oh my God, they’re about to kill [MASK].”
