<name>Sue</name>	Sue	Christmas	and she ain’ ‘custom polishing nobody floor and washin they clothes gi’ them but jus wait till the Mister come and take her out of this place she swear [MASK] ain’ come and find her in this place for it ain’ long now before the Mister come.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Tantie	At the next re-opening [MASK] took me to school, so early in the morning it was still a little dark. But when we got to the school there was already a restless army of women outside the closed gate with children squashed among them, children beginning to send up a peevish protest.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Joe	‘Western in yu arse, boy, Western in yu arse!’ and [MASK] was recreating the climax with a lively pantomime: ‘ ’ey boy, forty-million o’them against the star-boy and the rest o’them ridin comin and then he bullets run-out. . .’
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Tantie	They might think I was breaking biche. But I could look sick so that they would think I’d taken ill and had to go home again. I didn’t need any baggage because I had clothes up there. And [MASK] would soon make me some more.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Krishna	‘An’ then the other guys reach, an’ then, ol’-man, then yu jus’ see Red-Indian fallin-dong all over the place - ba-da-da-da-da -pretty, boy, pretty!’ mused [MASK].
<name>Usain</name>	Usain	Tantie	So then I summoned to my rescue every obscenity I could think of, and let fly like a machine-gun. He stood stock still and his mouth fell open. Then I ran. And run I could, for even [MASK] couldn’t catch me in critical moments.
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Toddan	When we came back it would be time for me to go to school, and [MASK] they could simply lose among Neighb’ Ramlaal-Wife’s own when there was no one at home. The August holidays had already begun, so that all the multitude was there.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Bernadette	3^ selves of it. The three of us had to pass through the gallery where [MASK]’s crowd was in session. As we walked down the front path one of the exaggeratedly feminine voices of the assembly floated down to us.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Mikey	[MASK] made us a swing, too, on the low branch of the mango-vert tree, but there was jumbie living in the tree, he said, so that was why the swing broke down every few days.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Eudora	That means you could very well speak properly if you wanted to! You came over here to better yourself, girl, I don’t understand why you have to go on talking like Grenadian people!’ [MASK] always looked as though she were on the point of crying.
<name>Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Windrip</name>	Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Windrip	Toddan	‘Come an play pitch. I have a t’ousan million t’ousan million marble. An mih Ma bringing-home a t’ousan million.’ ‘Yu story, man,’ commented [MASK]. ‘Well come an see nuh!
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Carol	‘Yes I know, darling, but you didn’t expect her to go to Mass in that niggery-looking dress, did you?’ ‘I don’t care, that is my dress,’ pouted [MASK], folding her arms in stubbornness.
<name>Liza</name>	Liza	Toddan	She carried on sullen monologues with [MASK] and me as audience, to the effect that she come from a desant home in a desant parta St George’s and she ain’ ‘custom polishing nobody floor and washin they clothes gi’ them
<name>she</name>	she	Tantie	The contents rolled out, the tooth lurching away from the other objects. There was a burst of laughter, quickly repressed as [MASK] turned and glared at the assembled company. She turned again to the business in hand.
<name>the cat</name>	the cat	Dash	these people wouldn’ scrape-up outa the rubbish-truck to sharpen they gran’-chirren nose, eh! 21 I wanted to shrink, to disappear. Sometimes I thought I would gladly live under the back steps with [MASK], rather than cross their paths all day long.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Tantie	‘What yu think the boy bring-home today?’ he panted, his eyes bright with jubilation. ‘I ain’ know,’ said [MASK]. ‘He mus’-be bring-home two dead-crapaud he find up the road.’
<name>Mary Poppins</name>	Mary Poppins	Cynthia	‘Some children think they are too grown-up; some children think they fell out of the sky, you know, [MASK], some children think they have no use whatsoever for anybody but themselves; but never mind, they soon find that they are not needed either.
<name>Anansi</name>	Anansi	Sir	If your parents don’t teach you respect then I will!’ Every one knew that [MASK] gave you two lashes with the tamarind whip and then paused to see the effect. If you looked sufficiently distressed he followed up with two more and then you could go.
<name>Mrs. Dalloway</name>	Mrs. Dalloway	Tantie	[MASK] cleared the table fiercely and then there was a further spell of clanging and crashing coming from the kitchen; at the end of which she emerged brusquely and attacked various unnecessary tasks with unnecessary vigour, at the same time launching into a sustained monologue.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mikey	When we heard his step in the gallery my heart and my stomach exchanged places. [MASK] slouched in. His jersey was of an indefinable colour and the hem of it half torn loose was draping his hips drunkenly like a gunbelt. His hair and face looked as if they had been powdered.
<name>her husband</name>	her husband	Mikey	She moved about the house in silence, setting the table, going to the window every few minutes and peering up the dark road. I sat frozen. I wanted to go to bed and be asleep with the pillow over my head when [MASK] came home.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Carol	She suggested I join the Guides and she seemed exasperated when she asked which company I’d been placed in and I said the Second. The evening when she announced that she was going to try to get me into [MASK]’s dancing school was a stormy one.
<name>drinking</name>	drinking	Tantie	The last time my father had suggested we join him [MASK] had been on the rampage for a week of evenings. uA rising u'tt” —y ♦ In the remaining time my standing was like that of a pariah who has suddenly inherited a title.
<name>Mr. Keating</name>	Mr. Keating	Sir	I let out a tearless, toneless and prolonged ship’s horn blast - [MASK] was thrown off-balance, for all activity stopped in the other classes and everyone fumed to look at us. And I bellowed on, wickedly, suddenly hitting upon the idea of introducing elements of tune into it.
<name>Beckett</name>	Beckett	Tantie	Many of [MASK]’s cronies were in the hustling company - none acknowledged the other. Then we were before the gate of the RC school. But the gate was shut and there was a piece of cardboard with letters on it that must have conveyed the fact that there was no more room.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Tee	She sat like this for a long time. Then she would shake her head sorrowfully. She couldn’t remember her grandmother’s true-true name. But [MASK] was growing into her grandmother again, her spirit was in me.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bernadette	And to my astonishment I one day overheard [MASK] in the gallery relating to her friends: ‘She is our first cousin. Her mother died so she’s been iro< 1 living with us - and she is so bright at school!
<name>Shirley</name>	Shirley	Rosa	Above the din a voice said: ‘But wha the arse? The people an them ain’ even wake-up self! [MASK] yu lazy bitch yu mean yu ain’t even wake-up an buy papers yet?’
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Tantie	There were days when we would be as quiet as mice from morning till night, or kept out of his range altogether. But we would rather die than report to [MASK] that he had delivered one of us a sound back-hand slap for vexing him.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Tantie	‘Whe’ Cyntie, man, the chile name in the papers an allyu dey sleepin like dead-people.’ ‘What yu talkin?’ breathed [MASK]. ‘Scholarship?’ ‘Wha’yu t’ink, robbery wid violence?’
<name>Snorter</name>	Snorter	Dash	For all the sounds around me were suddenly intimate, like urgent whispering. [MASK] every now and then growling to himself when other dogs barked; the boy’s voice thudding cosily about the darkened yard on the other side of the fence. To think that I could envy him for one moment!
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Carol	‘But that is my dress!’ exclaimed [MASK] when we rejoined the others. ‘Yes I know, darling, but you didn’t expect her to go to Mass in that niggery-looking dress, did you?’
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Tantie	Sooner or later I would be at the front gate. And it was always here that my plan broke down. For here I stood and looked up the path and saw [MASK] standing in the gallery with her arms folded.
<name>Indian</name>	Indian	Mikey	‘Yes.’ ‘An [MASK]?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Well awright,’ I said. ‘Bawl.’ He lay still with doubt. Presently he asked: ‘If I bawl we will go home?’
<name>Mrs. Buell</name>	Mrs. Buell	Bernadette	Her voice was far away and unreal, like everything else; I seemed to be looking into somebody’s window. [MASK] made a brief appearance enveloped in a frothy yellow bathrobe and face-cream, and sitting sideways speared up two mouthfuls of food before she floated away again.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Tantie	[MASK] never went near any kind of church herself, but there was no discussion as to our attendance, we went and that was that. It was just as though grown-ups sent us to see whether we could make better sense of it than they had ** been able to themselves.
<name>Oscar</name>	Oscar	Norman	You only have one uncle, that’s your Uncle [MASK].’ Then she leaned forward and whispered something to the company, whose heads had converged to listen, and then the heads came apart again in a few scurrying notes of amusement that were clipped-off at the edge.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Tantie	He was sceptical because previous experience had not shown that bawling brought any kind of desirable result - when he threw tantrums [MASK] usually set him out under the furthest mango tree with instructions to cry his bellyful before he came near the house again.
<name>Christopher Robin's mother</name>	Christopher Robin's mother	Carol	‘Pooh,’ said [MASK] as she uncurled her legs and stepped down from the bed with a loud stamp, to flounce over to the wardrobe. She extracted a tangled mass of frilliness and snarled strings and flung them sulkily onto the floor.
<name>man</name>	man	Ling	‘Come [MASK], do’ play stupid here for me now, because you an’ I know yu blasted smart! What all this was doin’ in the goods? Watch that big-stone dey an’ watch mih mout’!’
<name>he</name>	he	Toddan	I was inclined to deliberate over the matter, but since [MASK] accepted with enthusiasm I reflected with the sageness of the older that a problem of greater magnitude would be how to quiet him down if we didn’t go.
<name>Calypso</name>	Calypso	Ma’am	I found this most painful, especially after one shopkeeper remarked under his breath to the rest of his amused clients: ‘I wonder whe’ this one come-out, boy? Mus’ be land yesterday! [MASK], take mih picture, An’ I sing a kaiso for you!’
<name>nameless</name>	nameless	Toddan	‘He name [MASK],’ I informed her sharply. ‘Is I who name him.’ ‘Yes, darling,’ she said, with her irritating way of rolling my head into her bosom, ‘but that was when you were little.
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Tantie	There was no reason why her face should open out into a smile whenever she laid eyes on me, or why she should smile continuously while talking to me whatever the nature of the statement. It was not an unpleasant smile. It reminded me of a picture of my mother that [MASK] sometimes showed to us.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Carol	This continued for some time, and [MASK] told several more before she consented to come down. Much of the week was spent in selecting people for various posts, for the choir, the Dramatic Society, the netball team.
<name>Maycomb</name>	Maycomb	Tantie	And she kissed me on my forehead, turned and hustled the children out. As they disappeared through the door I had one fleeting urge ; to call them back. 24 Several times in the next few weeks I contemplated running away and going back to [MASK].
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Toddan	I was rushing down the path, distraught with joy. All the way home [MASK] talked and talked like a gramophone record. Then I spied the bakery, and he started to hop up and down, singing ‘The bakery, the bakery, look the bakery there.’
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Sir	But we were thoroughly annoyed at her for the way in which she would suddenly turn into a girl whenever [MASK] came down the stairs, and when he talked to her she either hung her head or looked up at him as though he were the Governor or we didn’t know who.
<name>Euphemia</name>	Euphemia	Euphemia	The People gave her the name [MASK] or Euph-something, but when they called her that she used to toss her head like a horse and refuse to answer so they’d had to give up in the end and call her by her true-true name.
<name>Miss Maudie</name>	Miss Maudie	Selwyn	But we wipe we backside with she paper - we send the chirren to get some town-breeze, an’ in that time I get a statement from [MASK] - yu shoulda see the bitch face in the Courthouse! Eh! she face look like if she panty fall-down!’
<name>Fresh-water</name>	Fresh-water	Manhatt’n	[MASK] was seen rather less at the bridge after that, and furthermore the fellows now thought nothing of addressing him as Fresh-water, the name they had formerly used only behind his back. Women going past walked a gauntlet of commentary on their anatomy and deportment.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Doolarie	After she had filled our hands with sweets she extended her arm and held one out to [MASK], saying, a note of severeness which we did not understand having crept into her voice: ‘Here, child, and go home, eh?
<name>Nanny</name>	Nanny	Tantie	Then we were passing over the bridge, and then we saw the big immortelle tree at the corner and we were both hopping up and down. That night there were macommes and compes in the house and we were sitting on [MASK]’s knees while she recounted the triumph.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Tantie	It was the first time in my life, too, that I was to sleep in a bed all by myself. ♦ The next morning I got into my blue and white uniform that [MASK] had remarked with a cheups was ‘damn nun-clothes’.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Tantie	It was when [MASK]’s features began to knot themselves hard together that I remembered with a plunge of dismay that we should never tell her that we had been down at the bridge. But it was too late. We had already told the whole story, which was brief enough.
<name>Samuel</name>	Samuel	Manhatt’n	But when one day someone maliciously murmured ‘Crick-crack!’ at the end of one of these accounts in perfect Western drawl, [MASK] in his rage forgot to screw his mouth to one side before starting to speak. ‘Crick-crack yu mother!
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Beatrice	‘It was your Auntie [MASK] . who gave you that name, dear,’ she said to him, ‘when you were a little tiny baby. Don’t you think it’s nicer than that silly name they call you?’
<name>the student</name>	the student	Eudora	What class did you go up to?’ ‘T’ird Standard, Ma’m,’ replied [MASK] without raising her eyes. ‘Well! There you are! Third Standard! That means you could very well speak properly if you wanted to!
<name>Salvador</name>	Salvador	Sir	But the picture of [MASK] a little boy running around in short pants wasn’t feasible. He had been born complete with his mustache and the bald area on his head like the middle part of the Savannah where skipping-ropes and cricket kept the grass away.
<name>Miss Caroline</name>	Miss Caroline	Sir	On Friday afternoons she herded us cluckingly down to the Savannah where we joined Third Standard under the big-tree and she promptly flopped into a girl again as we were stirred into their midst and [MASK] took charge of us all.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Bernadette	‘All right, all right,’ said [MASK], as she came into the kitchen and made for the stove, ‘what do you want me to do, go over there and call them?’ She lifted the lids off the saucepans and peeped in and sniffed, before fetching herself a plate.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Moonie	But the whole atmosphere seemed to be one of reproof, of trial; it was as if the whole church, people and building, were coldly regarding me, waiting to pull me up when I fell out of line. ♦ The day of [MASK]’s wedding approached and there was no mention of it.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Sir	appeared, or the Reverend had come to smile on us and pat j ••• ; random heads. Then it was that [MASK] edged backwards and eased the whip onto his chair or slid it under papers on his table, or on a few desperate occasions it slithered to the floor.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Gwan	He chewed the matchstick and eyed her up and down slowly with the matchstick hanging out of one corner of his mouth and the other corner stretched upwards in a saucy sneer: ‘How the Seen-Giargies gal?’ ‘[MASK], you hear, you ever hear me say “Seen-Giargies”?
<name>Mr. Creakle</name>	Mr. Creakle	Sir	Often the whip descended with terrible suddenness upon a back hunched tensely over its copy-book; [MASK] did not brook ‘upstartedness’ in the young, nor letters that did not bear a suitable likeness to the model script.
<name>Celie</name>	Celie	Tantie	[MASK] started as if she had been hit. Then she collected herself and continued wiping the table. ‘They don’ much like black-people up-there, yu know,’ she said casually. ‘Wha yu talking,
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Helen	What it is take yu at-all?’ I loved rainy mornings, for then I could pretend it was winter as I left for school bundled up in an old jacket. [MASK] wasn’t even my double. No, she couldn’t be called my double.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Toddan	Then a chinking, tittery silence was devastated by [MASK]’s voice. ‘Ooey!’ he suddenly exclaimed, springing down from the lady’s lap and pulling at his clothes. ‘Take off this damn stupid pants, man! Ah want to ka-ka!’
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Carol	The others were further sifted and a number chosen to go into the choir. [MASK] was among them. It seemed to me that it was more or less the same girls who were picked for the Dramatic Society, but I concluded that it was because singing and acting were related talents.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Tantie	CroeH'jj "t o^Te>\ cow&mej. ; V 'r'e hovel is 'Wv, lurfijrjVu^, )Khrr,,A^ny. 23 One day when I came home from school there lay on the dining-table an envelope covered with the tendril growth that was [MASK]’s hand, addressed to me.
<name>Mr. Casaubon</name>	Mr. Casaubon	Sir	We were further over-whelmed, as well as vaguely flattered, by the incomprehensibility of his utterances. This performance proved to be a regular feature. [MASK] was given to discoursing on things called ‘Seemliness’ and ‘Constancy’ and ‘Veracity’ and others.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Tantie	‘I would shit on allyu paper! Yu ain’t have no right! Get to Hell out mih yard!’ The stalwart policewoman spoke. ‘You shut yu face!’ [MASK] snapped, in a brief aside, ‘Whe’ you come-out?
<name>Auntie</name>	Auntie	Tantie	But when one day I started to put on socks to go to the shop, [MASK] was not amused. ‘Look, Madam, when yu start to wash yu own clothes then yu could start to play the monkey - you ever put-on socks to go down in the shop?
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Carol	I wondered how in the world I had ever thought to approach these two young ladies, far less beat them up, a few years before. Then there was some whispering and then [MASK]’s voice came forth out of a giggling: ‘Uhm . . .
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Sir	were newly-mounted upstairs children; they ignored us with all their might. We had games or story-reading, depending on [MASK]’s inclination. In either case he sat in state upon a chair with his legs crossed and a tamarind whip resting delicately across his knees.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Tantie	‘Paper? Wha paper?’ [MASK] was shouting. ‘I would shit on allyu paper! Yu ain’t have no right! Get to Hell out mih yard!’ The stalwart policewoman spoke. ‘You shut yu face!’
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Tantie	[MASK], referred to as ‘that woman,’ now received her full share of blame for this $0 state of affairs, to think that the woman should believe she had the right, and what will happen to the boy, what will happen to him?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Toddan	Then our hopes rose again as we heard a whole shuffle of footsteps approaching. It might be two people coming down the road! I hoisted [MASK] up again so that his eyes were even with the sill. In the darkness I could make out two figures.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Tantie	And whenever it was a bottle of anything he would drop the bike halfway up the path in his haste to get inside and tease [MASK] with it, making her guess what it was before he drew it forth from a paper bag.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Carol	[MASK] dropped her fork with a clang and pushed her chair back so that it made a loud granting noise and precipitated herself towards the ringing, but at the same moment the yellow froth tumbled down the stairs again, with a toothbrush in her mouth, and two hands stretched out for the receiver.
<name>Uncle Vernon</name>	Uncle Vernon	Toddan	Then his fat body rolled to one side - he was fast asleep. Long after [MASK] had been carted off to bed I stayed at the window, struggling to keep my eyes open. There were fewer people going past now so that I all but fell asleep between each set of footsteps.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Tantie	And I could manage my own hair, admirably, in fact, [MASK] thought - it had been some time since she had stopped combing it for me; she only did so when we were dressing up, or sometimes just ‘for sweetness’.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Eudora	Did you?’ And there was a noise like a whimper that must have been [MASK]’s reply. ‘Well what is the meaning of that then, what is the meaning of it? This is your last chance, girl, next time it’s out!
<name>he</name>	he	Mikey	Still nothing happened but it could only mean that she was saving up the rampage for when [MASK] came home. She moved about the house in silence, setting the table, going to the window every few minutes and peering up the dark road. I sat frozen.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Mavis	‘A-a, [MASK], is you? But look my cross. Big Sunday-mornin, sun ain’ good wipe-out the yampee out he eye yet, an you come to break-down people house!’
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jessica	Then [MASK] darted away teasingly and placed herself behind a mound of toys in the middle of the room, informing us that we were not to touch anything, whereupon I went over and extracted a plastic teacup from the pile and walked on it.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Toddan	She set out for school on mornings importantly with a fat book-bag. She objected to [MASK]’s nose - she said it was too flat, and she took to calling him Flat-Nose. If she wasn’t so big I’d have beaten her up.
<name>Miss Brodie</name>	Miss Brodie	Carol	[MASK]’s academic position wavered \vc'-A° between twelfth and twenty-fifth. Two new girls joined the class in the middle of the term. This was strange, for it was generally known that at the beginning of the year the pupils of the First Forms represented one-tenth of all the applicants.
<name>Miss Stephanie</name>	Miss Stephanie	Tantie	[MASK] said we were stupid, for they might not come back till next morning or maybe even for days but if we wanted to stand on tiptoe at the window for a week that was all right by her as long as we got down once in a while to bathe.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Carol	ly "¥-eiMce!s ciuidli'fcn, Sitting in state upon the bed [MASK] referred to me only as ‘she’. ‘I don’t know where she is going to put her things because all my dorncing-things are in there and I have nowhere else to put them.’
<name>Jody</name>	Jody	EC	There was nothing special about this part, there were choicer spots, like under the big-tree or down in the gully. There was really no reason, either, 'Jffi why [MASK] or RC children should not play on whichever side of ^ the Savannah they pleased.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Tantie	[MASK] started sending me to the shop all by myself on little errands - a pound of sugar, a piece of pig-tail. This was an exhilarating adventure, but it gave me a sad sinking feeling to come into the shop in broad daylight and with hardly anyone there.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Tantie	There was singing, now mournful, with a grumble of men’s voices welling up under the shrill ones, now to the accompaniment of drumming on the table or bottle- and-spoon. [MASK] sat on our bed.
<name>Father's</name>	Father's	Tantie	‘I was your [MASK]’s teacher, you know, do you know that?’ ‘Yes.’ He chuckled the same chuckle. He was shovelling through papers, peering closely at some only to push them away hurriedly and shovel some more.
<name>Mrs. Frankweiler</name>	Mrs. Frankweiler	Tantie	But it was too late. We had already told the whole story, which was brief enough. I waited for the rampage to begin. But [MASK] stood with her forehead creased as if she were thinking of something else.
<name>who</name>	who	HALLE	For the day began and ended with the intoning of the sounds which we could perform without a fault while our thoughts drifted elsewhere behind our tightly-shut eyes: Our father (which was plain enough) witchartin heavn [MASK] owedbethyname THY kingdumkum THY willbedunnunnert azitizinevn.. .
<name>Shirley</name>	Shirley	Mary	Oh no over there you learn poetries, and you have to stand up by yourself and say them in front of the whole school, no [MASK]-had-a-little-lamb oh no and you think everybody sits in a little cheenky cheenky room together?
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Carol	There were other new girls hanging about awkwardly like myself. Soon a bell rang, spreading a last decorous flutter about the yard before it was gracefully sucked into the portals all around. I was in the same class as [MASK], not that this promised to be of the remotest significance.
<name>Queequeg</name>	Queequeg	Sir	[MASK]’s eyes shooting crimson out of his head seemed to scurry in behind eyelids lowered a little like shutters, his forehead flattened itself, the bristling mustache lay down, and the roaring tailed off as his mouth was seen to roll swiftly out across his face like a mat.
<name>Mr. Charrington</name>	Mr. Charrington	Sir	Across the top of the blackboard was a permanent inscription in multicoloured chalk: the disciple is not greater than the master. It was written in flowery letters which [MASK] spent ages repairing when they became the slightest bit faded, stepping back and holding his head on one side to admire each curl he performed.
