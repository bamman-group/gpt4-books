<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tryon	"It is a long time, sir," replied [MASK]. "I must live more than twice as long as I have in order to cover it." "A long time, and a troubled time," sighed the judge.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	X	It would make no difference with him, so far as she was concerned; and she had no right to reveal her brother's secret. She was willing to bury the past in forgetfulness, now that she knew it would have no interest for her lover. [MASK] THE DREAM
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Rena	"Oh, what a lovely place!" exclaimed [MASK]. "That is yours, isn't it?" "No; we ain't got to my house yet," he answered. "Dat house b'longs ter de riches' people roun' here.
<name>Arthur's</name>	Arthur's	Warwick	[MASK]'s walk led him within three feet of the side gate, which he felt an almost irresistible impulse to enter. Every detail of the house and garden was familiar; a thousand cords of memory and affection drew him thither; but a stronger counter-motive prevailed.
<name>Aladdin</name>	Aladdin	Aladdin	Is there anything you want--money, or what? I should like to have [MASK]'s lamp--though I'd hardly need it--that you might have no wish unsatisfied." He had found her very backward in asking for things that she needed.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Wain	"You're goin' down there with 'im," added her mother, "an' it 'd be just as well to be on friendly terms with 'im." [MASK] himself had followed the women.
<name>John</name>	John	Frank	He, [MASK], was a man, an honest man--a better man than the shifty scoundrel with whom she had ridden away. She was but a woman, the best and sweetest and loveliest of all women, but yet a woman.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Rena	That a woman of [MASK]'s complexion should eat at a negro's table, or sleep beneath a negro's roof, was a seeming breach of caste which only black blood could excuse. The explanation was never questioned. No white person of sound mind would ever claim to be a negro.
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Frank'll	[MASK] take you home ter yo' mammy!" Toward noon he was met by a young white man, who peered inquisitively into the canopied cart. "Hello!" exclaimed the stranger, "who've you got there?" "A sick woman, suh."
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Tryon	The solemn silence of the pine forest is soothing or oppressive, according to one's mood. Beneath the cool arcade of the tall, overarching trees a deep peace stole over [MASK]'s heart. He had put aside indefinitely and forever an unhappy and impossible love.
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Tryon	"On the corner, sir," answered the clerk, "by the market-house, just over the drugstore. The doctor drove past here only half an hour ago. You'll probably catch him in his office." [MASK] found the office without difficulty.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rena	After a few short years of happiness or sorrow,--little of joy, perhaps, and much of sadness, which had begun already,--they would both be food for worms. White people, with a deeper wisdom perhaps than they used in their own case, regarded [MASK] and himself as very much alike.
<name>Clare</name>	Clare	Rena	[MASK]'s letter had re-inflamed his smouldering passion; only opposition was needed to fan it to a white heat. Wherein lay the great superiority of his position, if he was denied the right to speak to the one person in the world whom he most cared to address?
<name>probably</name>	probably	Rena	If he had not been so much upon his guard and [MASK] so much absorbed by thoughts of her future work, such a drive would have furnished a person of her discernment a very fair measure of the man's character.
<name>Count Vronsky</name>	Count Vronsky	Wain	Relying upon his own powers, and upon a woman's weakness and aversion to scandal, from which not even the purest may always escape unscathed, and convinced by her former silence that he had nothing serious to fear, [MASK] made it a point to be present at every public place where she might be.
<name>Mr. Crawford</name>	Mr. Crawford	Johnson	With a fatuousness born of vanity, however, no sooner had she sent her excuse than he began to look upon her visit to [MASK]'s as a mere exhibition of coyness, which, together with her conduct in the woods, was merely intended to lure him on.
<name>She</name>	She	Rena	If you chose to conceal it, no one would ever be the wiser. What is your name, child, and where were you brought up? You must have a romantic history." [MASK] gave her name and a few facts in regard to her past.
<name>Rena's son</name>	Rena's son	John	Your Rena'll stay with you always, and never, never leave you." [MASK] smoothed his mother's hair with a comforting touch, patted her withered cheek soothingly, lifted her tenderly to her place by his side, and put his arm about her.
<name>Darcy</name>	Darcy	Tryon	[MASK], to his pleased surprise, discovered in her mind depths that he had never suspected. She displayed a singular affinity for the tastes that were his--he could not, of course, know how carefully she had studied them.
<name>Sir Walter Raleigh</name>	Sir Walter Raleigh	Tryon	"I trust your Gracious Majesty is pleased with the homage of your devoted subjects," said [MASK], who spent much of his time by her side and kept up the character of knight in his speech and manner.
<name>Mr. Fairfax</name>	Mr. Fairfax	Warwick	I believe that privilege is mine, along with the other honors and rewards of victory,--unless she is bound to some one else." "She is entirely free," replied [MASK]. "Come as early as you like, and I'll talk to you until she's ready."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rena	Finding [MASK] among people of the best social standing, the subsequent intimation that she was a girl of no family had seemed a small matter to one so much in love. Nevertheless, in his present company he felt a decided satisfaction in being able to present for his future wife a clean bill of social health.
<name>Uncle Silas</name>	Uncle Silas	Frank	"This nigger has a bad eye,--he's up ter some sort of devilment. What ails the girl?" "'Pears ter be some kind of a fever," replied [MASK]; adding diplomatically, "I don't know whether it's ketchin' er no
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	I ain't done nuthin' ter speak of--not half ez much ez I would 'a' done. I wuz glad ter do w'at little I could, fer frien'ship's sake." "We value your friendship, [MASK], and we'll not forget it."
<name>Kepler</name>	Kepler	Tryon	The first effect of [MASK]'s discovery was, figuratively speaking, to knock the bottom out of things for him. It was much as if a boat on which he had been floating smoothly down the stream of pleasure had sunk suddenly and left him struggling in deep waters.
<name>Nig</name>	Nig	Caesar	he muttered. "It soun's mighty quare, ter say de leas'." He listened intently for a moment, but heard nothing further. "It must 'a' be'n a rabbit er somethin' scamp'in' th'ough de woods. G'long dere, [MASK]!"
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Rena	Any other young woman present would have been importuned beyond her powers of resistance. [MASK]'s reserve was respected. When supper was announced, somewhat early in the evening, the dancers found seats in the hall or on the front piazza.
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Rena	The cool night air calmed his throbbing pulses. The moonlight, streaming through the window, flooded the room with a soft light, in which he seemed to see [MASK] standing before him, as she had appeared that afternoon, gazing at him with eyes that implored charity and forgiveness.
<name>Ruth</name>	Ruth	Rena	I'll let you hear from us often, and no doubt you can see [MASK] now and then. But you must let her go, mother,--it would be a sin against her to refuse." "She may go," replied the mother brokenly.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tryon	But we'll spare you if you'll answer one question--is it serious?" "I'm to be married in two weeks, sir," answered [MASK]. The statement sounded very pleasant, in spite of the slight embarrassment caused by the inquiry.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Rena	The letter from [MASK] was read first, with profound disappointment. He had really made concessions in the settlement of that lawsuit--had yielded several hundred dollars of his just dues, in order that he might get back to
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	John	[MASK], I am the happiest man alive. Your sister has promised to marry me. I should like to shake my brother's hand." Never does one feel so strongly the universal brotherhood of man as when one loves some other fellow's sister.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Frank	I know from her and from my sister how good you've been to them." "Lawd, suh!" returned [MASK] deprecatingly, "you're makin' a mountain out'n a molehill. I ain't done nuthin' ter speak of--not half ez much ez
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	As the mule stepped forward, the sound was repeated. This time it was distinctly audible, the long, low moan of some one in sickness or distress. "Dat ain't no rabbit," said [MASK] to himself. "Dere's somethin' wrong dere.
<name>He</name>	He	Plato	Another thought struck her. [MASK] had been very quiet--there had been something on his conscience--perhaps he had betrayed her! But to which of the two men, and to what end? The problem was too much for her overwrought brain. She turned and fled.
<name>Dido</name>	Dido	Rena	The lady was so much interested, and put so many and such searching questions, that [MASK] really found it more difficult to suppress the fact that she had been white, than she had formerly had in hiding her African origin.
<name>George</name>	George	Jove	"I don't know whether you've seen the daughter or not--I'm sure you haven't for the past year or so, for she's been away. But she's in town now, and, by [MASK], the girl is really beautiful.
<name>her</name>	her	Rena	Reason, common-sense, the instinctive ready-made judgments of his training and environment,--the deep-seated prejudices of race and caste,--commanded him to dismiss [MASK] from his thoughts. His stubborn heart simply would not let go. XXI A GILDED OPPORTUNITY
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Rena	I would have a larger outlook elsewhere." "And what about our mother?" asked [MASK]. It would be necessary to leave her behind, they both perceived clearly enough, unless they were prepared to surrender the advantage of their whiteness and drop back to the lower rank.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Rena	[MASK] had a horror of snakes, with which the swamp by which the other road ran was infested. Snakes were a vivid reality; her presentiment was probably a mere depression of spirits due to her condition of nervous exhaustion.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Dave	Anything wanted, [MASK]?" asked the doctor. "Dat young 'oman's be'n heah ag'in, suh, an' wants ter see you bad. She's in de drugstore dere now, suh. Bless Gawd!" he added to himself fervently, "I 'membered dat.
<name>Stephen's</name>	Stephen's	Warwick	Molly, in all probability, care to leave home and friends and the graves of her loved ones. She had no mental resources to supply the place of these; she was, moreover, too old to be transplanted; she would not fit into [MASK]'s scheme for a new life.
<name>Malone</name>	Malone	Walden	I'll see how he will answer it." The boy maintained an awkward silence, while the old judge eyed him keenly. "My father's dead," he said at length, in a low voice. "I'm Mis' Molly [MASK]'s son.
<name>Miss Watson</name>	Miss Watson	Frank	"Good-by, [MASK]," she said, with a kind smile; "I hope you and mamma will be good friends while I'm gone." The whistle blew a second warning blast, and the deck hands prepared to draw in the gang-plank.
<name>Mr. Collins</name>	Mr. Collins	Wain	She had as yet no fear of personal violence from [MASK]; but, under the circumstances, his attentions were an insult. He was evidently bent upon conquest, and vain enough to think he might achieve it by virtue of his personal attractions.
<name>she</name>	she	Rena	He was not influenced by sordid considerations; he would have denied that his course was controlled by any narrow prudence. If [MASK] had been white, pure white (for in his creed there was no compromise), he would have braved any danger for her sake.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Frank	she moaned; "I'm black; you don't love me; you despise me!" Her voice died away into a hopeless wail. [MASK] knelt by her side, his faithful heart breaking with pity, great tears rolling untouched down his dusky cheeks.
<name>Marmee</name>	Marmee	Rena	"He made us, too," continued [MASK], intent upon her own thought, "and He must have had a reason for it. Perhaps He meant us to bring the others together in his own good time.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jenny	When she became aware of his purpose, she called to one of the children who was loitering behind the others, "Wait a minute, [MASK]. I'm going your way, and you can walk along with me."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	John	"Your son came in to see me the other day," he remarked. "He seems to have got along." "Oh, yes, judge, he's done fine, [MASK] has; an' he's took his sister away with him."
<name>The woman</name>	The woman	Rena	His skill and suppleness brought a glow of admiration into the eyes of the women, and spread a cloud of jealousy over the faces of several of the younger men, who saw themselves eclipsed. [MASK] had announced in advance her intention to take no active part in the festivities.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	[MASK] is the best friend I have got in town, because he does so much for me and don't want nothing in return. (He tells me not to put this in about him, but I want you to know it.)
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Rena	"Of course, mother," he said calmly, "I wouldn't think of taking [MASK] away against your wishes. A mother's claim upon her child is a high and holy one. Of course she will have no chance here, where our story is known.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tryon	But do not despair; all is not lost. [MASK] will not marry you, as I hoped he might, while I feared the contrary; but he is a gentleman, and will be silent. Come back and try again."
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Rena	[MASK] had fully and firmly made up her mind to sacrifice her life upon this altar. Her absorption in the work had not been without its reward, for thereby she had been able to keep at a distance the spectre of her lost love.
<name>Laurie</name>	Laurie	John	You improve on acquaintance; to-night, I find you handsomer still." "Now, [MASK]," said his mother, expostulating mildly, "you'll spile her, if you don't min'." The girl was beaming with gratified vanity.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Warwick	Well, well! and how have you been getting along?" [MASK] told his story in outline, much as he had given it to his mother and sister, and the judge seemed very much interested. "And you married into a good family?"
<name>Rowena</name>	Rowena	Rena	[MASK]'s eyes were fastened on her knight, so that she might lose no single one of his movements. As he rode down the lists, more than one woman found him pleasant to look upon. He was a tall, fair young man, with gray eyes, and a frank, open face.
<name>John</name>	John	Warwick	"She may go," replied the mother brokenly. "I'll not stand in her way--I've got sins enough to answer for already." [MASK] watched her pityingly. He had stirred her feelings to unwonted depths, and his sympathy went out to her.
<name>the hotel</name>	the hotel	Frank	I was afraid that you might not care to go back just now, and so I brought your trunk along with me." He gave his mother the baggage-check. She took it across to [MASK], who, during the day, brought the trunk from the depot.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Warwick	My maternal great-great-grandfather, a hundred and fifty years ago, was hanged, drawn, and quartered for stealing cattle across the Scottish border. How is that for a pedigree? Behold in me the lineal descendant of a felon!" [MASK] felt much relieved at this avowal.
<name>Denisov</name>	Denisov	Rena	For he had always been, in a figurative sense, a naturalized foreigner in the world of wide opportunity, and [MASK] was one of his old compatriots, whom he was glad to welcome into the populous loneliness of his adopted country.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tryon	The doctor was solicitous, felt his pulse, examined his tongue, pronounced him feverish, and prescribed a sedative. [MASK] sought refuge in his room at the hotel, from which he did not emerge again until morning. His emotions were varied and stormy.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Rena	She had brought away from her interview of the morning the impression that [MASK] was a fine, pure spirit, born out of place, through some freak of Fate, devoting herself with heroic self-sacrifice to a noble cause.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Tryon	I can walk the rest of the way." "I think I'll wait here, doctor," answered [MASK]. "I'll step up to my room a moment. I'll be back by the time you're ready."
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Wain	He knew that her experience had dragged her through the valley of humiliation. His unselfish devotion had reacted to refine and elevate his own spirit. When he heard the suggestion, after her second departure, that she might marry [MASK], he could not but compare himself with this new aspirant.
<name>Angel</name>	Angel	Rena	That two intelligent persons should each attach a different meaning to so simple a form of words as [MASK]'s question was the best ground for her misgiving with regard to the marriage. But love blinded her. She was anxious to be convinced.
<name>Lily</name>	Lily	Rena	He had perceived, more clearly than she could have appreciated it at that time, the undeveloped elements of discord between [MASK] and her former life. He had imagined her lending grace and charm to his own household. Still another motive, a purely psychological one, had more or less consciously influenced him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Plato	Having warned away several smaller children who had hung around after school as though to share his prerogative of accompanying the teacher, [MASK] had swung himself into the low branches of an oak at the edge of the clearing, from which he was hanging by his legs, head downward.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Strong	A couple of hours later, they found her lying unconscious in the edge of the swamp, only a few rods from a well-defined path which would soon have led her to the open highway. [MASK] arms lifted her gently and bore her home.
<name>Laurie</name>	Laurie	Tryon	[MASK] gave no visible manifestation beyond a certain taciturnity, so much at variance with his recent liveliness that the ladies could not fail to notice it. No effort upon the part of either was able to affect his mood, and they both resigned themselves to await his lordship's pleasure to be companionable.
<name>Undine</name>	Undine	Rena	With [MASK]'s advent, however, he had seen life through different glasses. His heart had thrilled at first sight of this tall girl, with the ivory complexion, the rippling brown hair, and the inscrutable eyes.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Rena	In a few weeks the echoes of the tournament died away, and [MASK]'s life settled down into a pleasant routine, which she found much more comfortable than her recent spectacular prominence. Her queenship, while not entirely forgiven by the ladies of the town, had gained for her a temporary social prominence.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Rowena	All I care to know of [MASK]'s family is that she is your sister; and you'll pardon me, old fellow, if I add that she hardly needs even you,--she carries the stamp of her descent upon her face and in her heart."
<name>Priscilla</name>	Priscilla	Plato	Instead of capering along like a playful kitten or puppy, he walked by her side unusually silent. When they had gone a short distance and were approaching a path which intersected their road at something near a right angle, the teacher missed [MASK].
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Rena	The brain-cells never lose the impressions of youth, and [MASK]'s Patesville life was not far enough removed to have lost its distinctness of outline. Of the two, the present was more of a dream, the past was the more vivid reality.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Rena	We are happy when we think ourselves happy, and with a strange perversity we often differ from others with regard to what should constitute our happiness. [MASK]'s secret was the worm in the bud, the skeleton in the closet. "He says that he loves me.
<name>Stanley</name>	Stanley	Wain	No sooner was the child well out of sight than [MASK] threw his arms suddenly about her waist and smilingly attempted to kiss her. Speechless with fear and indignation, she tore herself from his grasp with totally unexpected force, and fled incontinently along the forest path.
<name>Dinah</name>	Dinah	Dave	"Yas," replied [MASK], "she wuz here a little w'ile ago, an' said she wuz gwine downstairs ter de drugsto'. I would n' be s'prise' ef you'd fin' her dere now." XV MINE OWN PEOPLE
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	John	My dear [MASK]," replied the young man warmly, "there is a great deal of nonsense about families. If a man is noble and brave and strong, if a woman is beautiful and good and true, what matters it about his or her ancestry?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Plato	I wanted you to go to town to-morrow to take an important message for me. I'm sorry, [MASK]--you might have earned another dollar." To lie is a disgraceful thing, and yet there are times when, to a lover's mind, love dwarfs all ordinary laws.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Rena	[MASK]'s image was not to be easily expelled from his heart; for the laws of nature are higher and more potent than merely human institutions, and upon anything like a fair field are likely to win in the long ran. XVII TWO LETTERS
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Tryon	[MASK] found the subject a little tiresome, and the doctor's enthusiasm not at all contagious. He could not possibly have been interested in a colored girl, under any circumstances, and he was engaged to be married to the most beautiful white woman on earth.
<name>he</name>	he	Tryon	This communication properly required an answer, which might have been made in writing within the compass of ten lines. No sooner, however, had [MASK] read the letter than he began to perceive reasons why it should be answered in person.
<name>she</name>	she	Blanche	In his own opinion, he ought to see something of the world, and have his youthful fling. Later on, when he got ready to settle down, if [MASK] were still in the humor, they might marry, and sink to the humdrum level of other old married people.
<name>the writer</name>	the writer	Blanche	The reasonable inference from the letter was that [MASK] meant to await his return. Her presence would spoil the fine romantic flavor of the surprise he had planned for his mother; it would never do to expose his bride to an unannounced meeting with the woman whom he had tacitly rejected.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Frank	There would have been no legal barrier to their union; there would have been no frightful menace to white supremacy in the marriage of the negro and the octoroon: the drop of dark blood bridged the chasm. But [MASK] knew that she did not love him, and had not hoped that she might.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Tryon	She was aware that [MASK] watched her now and then, with an eye rather critical than indulgent. "He is comparing me with some other girl," she surmised. "I seem to stand the test very well. I wonder who the other is, and what was the trouble?"
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Warwick	The sound of her voice gave [MASK] a thrill. It was soft and sweet and clear--quite in harmony with her appearance. That it had a faint suggestiveness of the old woman's accent he hardly noticed, for the current Southern speech, including his own, was rarely without a touch of it.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Rena	When [MASK]'s eyes fell upon the young man in the buggy, she saw a face as pale as death, with starting eyes, in which love, which once had reigned there, had now given place to astonishment and horror. She stood a moment as if turned to stone.
<name>Teacher</name>	Teacher	John	I love the child, and am grieved to leave him. I'm grateful, too, [MASK], for what you have done for me. I am not sorry that I tried it. It opened my eyes, and I would rather die of knowledge than live in ignorance.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Warwick	"You'll be gettin' married again," suggested his mother. "No," he replied; "I think not." [MASK] was still reading his sister's face, and saw the spark of hope that gleamed in her expressive eye.
<name>her</name>	her	Rena	Even his mother would admit this, if she could only see [MASK]. To win this beautiful girl for his wife would be a worthy task. He had crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty; since then she had ascended the throne of his heart.
<name>Mr. Spencer</name>	Mr. Spencer	Warwick	During the day, [MASK] had taken his meals in the dining-room, with the captain and the other cabin passengers. It was learned that he was a South Carolina lawyer, and not a carpet-bagger. Such credentials were unimpeachable, and the passengers found him a very agreeable traveling companion.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jinny	I thought I felt somethin' slip th'ough dat hole in my pocket jes' by the big pine stump in the schoolhouse ya'd. [MASK], chile, run back an' hunt fer my knife, an' I'll give yer five cents ef yer find it.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Wain	"Which I doubt very much," he muttered to himself, as she went away with [MASK]. "What a pity that such a woman should be a nigger! If she were anything to me, though, I should hate to trust her anywhere near that saddle-colored scoundrel.
<name>Grandpa</name>	Grandpa	Tryon	A clatter of voices broke upon the stillness of the forest and interrupted [MASK]'s speech. A sudden turn to the left brought the buggy to a little clearing, in the midst of which stood a small log schoolhouse.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Tryon	I reckon she would, spite er her gittin' up so in de worl'; fer she wuz alluz good ter ev'ybody, an' dat let even ME in," he concluded with a sigh. "Who is the lady, [MASK]?"
<name>dark</name>	dark	Rena	Toward nightfall he found her. She was white enough, with the sallowness of the sandhill poor white. She was still young, perhaps, but poverty and a hard life made her look older than she ought. She was not fair, and she was not [MASK].
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Rena	He suddenly awoke, however, to the fact that these signs of merriment came from the house at which he had intended to stop;--he had not meant that [MASK] should pass another sleepless night of sorrow, or that he should himself endure another needless hour of suspense.
