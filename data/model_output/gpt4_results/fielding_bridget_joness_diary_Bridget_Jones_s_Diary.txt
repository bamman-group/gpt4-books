<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Perpetua	Weird scenario with [MASK] (penultimate boss), since knew I was messaging and v. angry, but fact that was messaging ultimate boss gave self conflicting feelings of loyalty—distinctly unlevel playing field where anyone with ounce of sense would say ultimate boss should hold sway.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Julio	“Merry Christmas, er . . . Can I get you a sherry—ah, got one already. Jolly good. Mince pie?” “You sleep,” said [MASK] dangerously, “with my woman.”
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Magda	Or stay out all night with no questions asked. Don’t suppose you fancy coming shopping tomorrow morning, do you?” “Er. Well, I’ve got to go to work,” I said. “Oh,” said [MASK], looking momentarily surprised.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sharon	But then, as [MASK] pointed out, last time we did that they got back together and she told him everything we’d said in a fit of reconciliatory confession and now it is cripplingly embarrassing every time we see him
<name>Parvati</name>	Parvati	Una	“Bit showy, isn’t it?” said [MASK] the second she was within earshot, pulling her stole huffily around her shoulders. “I think if you take these things too far it gets a bit common.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Daniel	At 6 o’clock I resolutely put my coat on and left, only to meet [MASK] getting into my lift on the floor below. There we were, just him and me, caught in a massive electrical-charge field, pulled together irresistibly, like a pair of magnets.
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Patchouli	“Wha’?” yelled [MASK] above the din. She was wearing a crocheted midi-dress with a floppy straw hat and an orange Bri-nylon saddle-stitched blouse on top. As if the things I used to wear in my teens were a hilarious joke.
<name>Christmas</name>	Christmas	Geoffrey	Of course you’re going to to use your new suitcase.” nt with bottles for your thought of was a shop- mas?” I said desperately, n ight. r/thing / need. Now, dar-coming to [MASK] and et this year, won’t you?”
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Daniel	Still no answer. I knew he must be around because his car was there and he’d said he was going to be working and watching the cricket. I looked up at his window and there was [MASK]. I beamed at him, waved and pointed at the door.
<name>David</name>	David	Gav	“Actually, I was only six at the time.” Eventually we gave up on conversation and [MASK], with tremendous excitement (this, I recall, the fabulous thing about twenty-two-year-olds) began to kiss me and simultaneously try to find entrances to my clothes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Peter	Chuh, well it’s very depressing.” “Oh, poor you. Yes, I saw [MASK] last night . . . (Where? What? Why wasn’t I invited?) “. . . and he was telling everyone how upset you were about the wedding.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Daniel	ancient Cornish waterside pub sipping pints in matching striped T-shirts and watching the sun set over the sea; [MASK] and I eating candlelit dinners in historic country-house-hotel courtyards then retiring to our room to shag all hot summer night. Anyway.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bridget	I thought about dropping to the bottom of the pole and rushing back up the stairs but I was only a few feet down so I started to pull myself up again instead. Then suddenly there was a great bellow in my ear. “[MASK]! We’re on you.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bridget	I also was unwise enough to leave the house in her name, and she has remortgaged it. We are ruined, destitute and homeless, [MASK], and your mother is to be branded a common criminal.” After that he broke down.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Bridget	That’s it! What do lesbians actually do in bed?” Suddenly, he was looking straight at me. “Do you know?” Everyone stared at me. “Come on, [MASK]-fucking-late-again,” he shouted impatiently.
<name>Mark</name>	Mark	Tom	Oh God. As [MASK] never tires of telling me, in a sepulchral voice, laying his hand on my arm and staring into my eyes with an alarming look, “Only Women Bleed.” I24lh lbs. (have lost 3 lbs., 8 oz.

<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daniel	“What are you doing?” [MASK] was standing in the doorway. “Nothing, nothing. Just thought I might have left a skirt of mine behind the sofa,” I said, wildly plumping up the cushions as if I were in a French farce.
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Daniel	I shall be poised and cool and remember that I am a woman of substance and do not need men in order to be complete, especially not him. Am not going to message him or indeed take any notice of him whatsoever. 9:30 a.m. Humph. [MASK] does not seem to be here yet.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Daniel	Is [MASK] having an affair? 11:50 a.m. Hmmm. Nail really is scratchy. Actually, if don’t do something about it I’ll start picking at it and next thing I’ll have no fingernail left. Right, I’d better go and find an emery board.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Jude	“[MASK],” I said, hurt, “did you say, ‘pretend’?” <—Friday 3 November 128 lbs. (humph), alcohol units 2, cigarettes 8, Smoothies 13, calories 5245. 11 a.m. V. excited about dinner party.
<name>homeless</name>	homeless	winos	You couldn’t possibly lend me some cash? I mean not much, just a couple of hundred quid or something so I can get some travelers’ checks.” The way she said it reminded me of the way [MASK] ask for money for a cup of tea.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Bridget	I’m thinking twenty years from now. What about that kid who had his penis burnt off by firecrackers in his pockets back in the sixties? Where is he now? [MASK], find me the Fireworks Kid with no Penis.
<name>Mrs. McKee</name>	Mrs. McKee	Julio	“Ah, that’ll be [MASK]. Yup, yup.” She was balancing a portable phone under her chin now and scribbling. “Yup, yup. Put it on, darling,” she hissed. “Yup, yup. Yup. Yup.”
<name>James</name>	James	Wicksy	Also the party was quite nice last night, but at one point we went over to join [MASK] and a very pretty girl he was talking to. I did notice, as we approached, that she looked rather defensive.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Tom	He was really into you.” “He wasn’t. Shut-urrrrp.” “He was. Stop obsessing. Leave it to me.” Sometimes feel without [MASK] I would sink without trace and disappear. <—Tuesday 19 September 124 lbs.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mark	“May I?” said [MASK], holding out his hand to me. “No,” I said, furious. “What’s the matter?” “Um,” I said, flailing for an excuse for being so angry.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Decided needed to spend more time on appearance like Hollywood stars and have therefore spent ages putting concealer under eyes, blusher on cheeks and defining fading features. “Good God,” said [MASK] when I arrived. “What?” I said. “What?”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Jeremy	When [MASK]-comes home at the end of the day he wants to put his feet up and be nurtured and, as I imagine all the time now, fantasize about girls in leotards at the Harbour Club. “I had a proper job before.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Daniel	he yelled. He asked me various probing questions: for example, what [MASK]’s behavior had been like over the last few days when, having sent the card, he had had no response from me. I reported that he had seemed flirtier than usual.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Tom	“They simply can’t be bothered to relate to the opposite sex. Look at your [MASK]. I really think if that boy had anything about him he’d be going out with you properly instead of all this ridiculous, ‘friends’ nonsense.”
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Bridget	“Mmm,” I said. “And she’s amazingly young-looking—I mean she could easily pass for twenty-four or twenty-five. You were at school together, weren’t you, [MASK]? Was she three or four years below you?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Daniel	The whole thing builds up out of all proportion, so finding a relationship seems a dazzling, almost insurmountable goal, and when you do start going out with someone it cannot possibly live up to expectations. Is it that? Or is it that there is something wrong with me being with [MASK]?
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Jones	Spasmodic nature of recent skirt attendance suggests malingering. Cleave Just sending back: Message Cleave Skirt is demonstrably neither sick nor abscent. Appalled by management's blatently sizist attitude to skirt. Obsessive interest in skirt suggests management sick rather than skirt. [MASK] Hmm.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Determined	[MASK], instead of fearing the scary party, panicking all the way through and going home pissed and depressed, am going to improve social skills, confidence and Make Parties Work for Me—as guided by article have just read in magazine.
<name>Neil</name>	Neil	Daniel	Do not know what to believe in or hold on to anymore. Feel like ringing [MASK] in hope he could deny everything, come up with plausible explanation for the clothes-free rooftop valkyrie—younger sister, friendly neighbor recovering from flood or similar—which would make everything all right.
<name>Marks</name>	Marks	M&S	Therefore, in addition to the three-course meal and two bottles of wine (1 fizzy, 1 white) I had already bought from [MASK] (I mean prepared by entire day’s slaving over hot stove) we had: 1 tub hummus & pkt mini-pitas.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jones	* Message [MASK] Thanks for your phone call. Cleave. My heart sank. That phone call was suggesting a date. Who replies by saying “thanks” and leaves it at that unless they . . . but after a little thought, I sent back: Message Cleave Please shut up.
<name>Trainspotting</name>	Trainspotting	Jude	“Bastards,” I yelled through a mouthful of raspberry pavlova mixed with tiramisu. “Bloody bastards!” shouted [MASK], lighting a Silk Cut with the butt end of the last one. Just then the doorbell rang.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Realize	Press red and nothing happens. Press numbers and nothing happens. Wish stupid video had never been invented. 9:25 p.m. Aargh. Suddenly main menu is on TV saying “Press 6.” Oh dear. [MASK] was using telly remote control by mistake.
<name>they</name>	they	Daniel	Wise people will say [MASK] should like me just as I am, but I am a child of Cosmopolitan culture, have been traumatized by supermodels and too many quizzes and know that neither my personality nor my body is up to it if left to its own devices.
<name>darling</name>	darling	Jones	Then he lightly brushed a hair from my forehead, took my cheek in his hand and kissed me, urgently, desperately. After a while he held me hard against him and whispered throatily, “I don’t think you’ll be needing that taxi, [MASK].”
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Daniel	'—Tuesday lO January 127 lbs., alcohol units 2, cigarettes 0, calories 998 (excellent, v.g., perfect saint-style person). Slunk into the office crippled with embarrassment about the message. I had resolved totally to detach myself from [MASK]
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Simon	Scour newspapers for ages of everyone, trying to decide if they look old for their age. 11 a.m. Phone just rang. It was [MASK], to tell me about the latest girl he has got his eye on. “How old is she?”
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Jude	“But you don’t go round wearing your commitment problem on your sleeve like every bloody man over the age of twenty does these days.” “Exactly my point,” spat [MASK], trying to light up another Silk Cut but having trouble with the lighter.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Jude	“Something’s wrong, though, I just know,” I said in a mysterious, loaded voice, realizing for the first time what an intensely instinctive and intuitive person I am. “I know what you mean,” said [MASK], portentously.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Magda	I had wrapped up a spare bottle of posh olive oil as a generalized emergency gift which fell out of my coat and broke on [MASK]’s Conran Shop rug. Ugh. Would that Christmas could just be, without presents.
<name>Trisha</name>	Trisha	Jeremy	“Getting a bit of a shag, old girl?” said [MASK]. All eyes turned to me, beadily. Mouths open, slavering. “It’s none of your business,” I said hoity-toitily. “So she hasn’t got a man!”
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Humph	What—do you know him as well?” “Well, yes. I mean, we’ve done some work with him. He’s incredibly nice and attractive. I thought you said the chap at the Turkey Curry Buffet was a real geek.” [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sharon	“Actually, I’m going on to a nightclub.” I trilled, hurrying out into the street. “Thanks for a super evening!” Then I got into a taxi and burst into tears. Midnight. Har har. Just called [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Patchouli	“This isn’t too tarty, is it?” the girl was saying to [MASK]. “You should have seen those bitch thirtysomethings’ faces when I walked in . . . Oh!” Both girls looked at me, horrified, with their hands over their mouths.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Geoffrey	How’s yer love life!” quipped [MASK], giving me one of his special hugs, then going all pink and adjusting his slacks. “Fine.” “So you still haven’t got a chap. Durr! What are we going to do with you!”
<name>Voila</name>	Voila	Eureka	It is, she said, rather like when you can’t get a key to open a lock and if you wiggle it furiously it gets worse, but take it out, stick a bit of lip gloss on it, then just sort of sense your way and [MASK]!
<name>Daniel</name>	Daniel	Daniel	Monday 16 January 128 lbs. (from where? why? why?), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 20, calories 1500, positive thoughts 0. 10:30 a.m. Office. [MASK] is still locked in his meeting. Maybe it was a genuine excuse.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Dan	The bath!” I ran upstairs, but when I got to my door I realized I’d shut it behind me with the key inside. I started banging my head against it, yelling, “Shit, shit!” Then [MASK] appeared in the hall.
<name>Jess</name>	Jess	Simon	“Nothing. No, I just thought . . .” “What? What?” “Maybe you’ve lost it a bit quickly off your . . . face,” she trailed off, looking at my admittedly somewhat deflated cleavage. [MASK] was the same.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Cosmo	“There’s nothing you can do, it’s a hereditary thing. [MASK] doesn’t have a problem in that area, does he?” Thought head was going to burst with the racket. Eventually made my excuses and drove home, congratulating myself on being single.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Bridget	I wonder if it’s time to go to bed yet? Oh no, it’s only 8:30. Inner poise. Ooh. Telephone. 9 p.m. It was my father, speaking in a weird, disconnected voice, almost as if he were an E.T. “[MASK].
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Daniel	Was believing could totally reinvent self in space of small number of days, thereby negating impact of [MASK]’s hurtful and humiliating infidelity, since it had happened to me in a previous incarnation and would never have happened to my new improved self.
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Jude	“Have you got any camomile tea?” I said to [MASK] at one point as she lurched past, hiccupping happily, at which point she collapsed into giggles, put her arm round me and fell over. I decided I’d better go home.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Bridge	“You should thank your lucky stars, [MASK],” he said, lying on his back and blowing smoke at the ceiling. “You’d probably have married some crashing northern Engineering student and spent the rest of your life cleaning out the whippet cage.
<name>Shazzer</name>	Shazzer	Becca	Get any Valentines this year, did you?” “Actually, yes,” I breathed crossly. At which he burst out laughing again, then said he had to go because he and [MASK] were off to do Tai Chi in the park.
<name>Godspeed</name>	Godspeed	Cheerio	“Well, that’ll be lovely. I shall put that in the diary for the twenty-ninth and dig out my dog collar. Now, we’d better get back and catch up on our sleep. You take care of yourself, now. [MASK].
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Daniel	Then you lose weight and get a bit leggy and shag-me hippy and people start taking you out for meals. So then you put a few pounds on, the invitations trail off and you start losing weight again.” “[MASK]!” I exploded.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Becks	Matter of supreme indifference to me. <—Tuesday 14 February 126 lbs., alcohol units 2 (romantic Valentine’s Day treat—2 bottles, [MASK], on own, huh), cigarettes 12, calories 1545. 8 a.m. Oooh, goody. Valentine’s Day.
<name>Sharon</name>	Sharon	Vanessa	Rushed down and gleefully picked them up just as the downstairs-flat door opened and [MASK] came out. “Ooh, they look nice,” she said enviously. “Who are they from?” “I don’t know!”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jude	asked [MASK] when I walked in. “You look really tired.” “I’m fine,” I said, crestfallen. “I’ve lost seven pounds. What’s the matter?” “Nothing. No, I just thought . . .”
<name>Shazzer</name>	Shazzer	Tom	Apart from sex, he agrees. I’m going to meet [MASK] tonight with brochures to plan fantasy, or phantom mini-break. So I must work really hard this afternoon. 12:40 p.m. These shorts and T-shirt are too uncomfortable in this heat.
<name>Shazzer's</name>	Shazzer's	Tom	(disaster), cigarettes 32, alcohol units 6 (shop has run out of Smoothies—careless bastards), calories 2266, lottery tickets 4. 7 p.m. Humph. Bonfire night and not invited to any bonfires. Rockets going off tauntingly left right and center. Going round to [MASK]’s.
<name>Shazzer</name>	Shazzer	Sharon	“We women are only vulnerable because we are a pioneer generation daring to refuse to compromise in love and relying on our own economic power. In twenty years’ time men won’t even dare start with fuckwittage because we will just laugh in their faces,” bellowed [MASK].
<name>Poppy</name>	Poppy	Elaine	Grr. Grrr. Grrrrrrr. I absolutely cannot deal with her when she’s like this. “Anyway, I’ll tell [MASK] you’d love to come, shall I?” she said, picking up the inexplicable sewing machine as she headed for the door.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Julio	I don’t think he knows anything about [MASK] or the man from the tax office. I asked him if he’d like me to come up tomorrow and we could go out and have a nice supper together on Saturday night and maybe go for a walk on Sunday, but he said he was all right.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Daniel	And me retorting, “[MASK]. I am avin’ ay fag.” too Wednesday 3 May 128 lbs.* (Eek. Baby growing at monstrous unnatural rate), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, calories 3100 (but mainly potatoes, oh my God).
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Bridget	He was obviously trying to work out how he could get away with sleeping with a prostitute himself. Suddenly, he was looking straight at me. “Do you know?” The entire table of grunge youths stared. “You. You must be [MASK]!”
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Lord	Thanking you for your kind attention. [MASK], regarding this matter. Saturday 13 may 727 lbs., 8 oz., cigarettes 1, calories 1145, instant lottery tickets 5 (won £2 therefore total expenditure only £3, v.g.),
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Daniel	I expected [MASK] to at least be sympathetic. I know it’s all to do with my worries about where my career is leading me but he just lit himself a cigarette and asked me to run over the bit about the Domestic Science apron again.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Tom	Have reached point where believe nutritional ideal is to eat nothing at all and that the only reason people eat is because they are so greedy they cannot stop themselves from breaking out and ruining their diets. “How many calories in a boiled egg?” said [MASK].
<name>Helena</name>	Helena	Perpetua	No. of shows seen 0. 2 a.m. Can’t get to sleep. I bet they’re all at a really nice party. 3 a.m. Just heard [MASK] come in, giving her verdict on the alternative comedians: “Puerile . . . completely childish . .
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Una	What about that lovely cerise two-piece you used to wear? Oh, by the way, did I tell you [MASK]’s gone down the Nile?” Grrrr. Felt so bad when she put the phone down that smoked five Silk Cut in row.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	Byeee!” 9 a.m. Brief moment of party oasis when an invitation arrived in the post but turned out to be party mirage: invitation to a sale of designer eyewear. 11:30 a.m. Called [MASK] in paranoid desperation to see if he wanted to go out tonight.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fack	“[MASK].” As they disappeared ahead I could hear her telling him off. “I told you it was ridiculous spending all afternoon arranging candles in dangerous places for people to fall over. Your time would have been far better spent ensuring that the placement was ...”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jude	So maybe my whole body is getting smaller but denser. The whole thing smacks of female bodybuilders and makes me feel strangely sick. Call up [MASK] to complain about diet failure, who says write down everything you’ve eaten, honestly, and see if you stuck to the diet.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Elena	Hmmm. Ah v. confusing. Tuesday 24 October 129 lbs. (bloody Smoothies), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 0, Smoothies 32. On marvelous roll with work. Ever since [MASK] whatserface interview, seems can do no wrong. “Come on! Come on!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Daniel	Oh, of course I’d checked the cupboards on the way up the stairs and there was no one in any of them. But I knew there was a woman in [MASK]’s house. Maybe it was a slight smell . . .
<name>Shazzer</name>	Shazzer	Sharon	Hurrah! Singletons should not have to explain themselves all the time but should have an accepted status—like geisha girls do,” I shouted happily, slurping on my tumbler of Chilean Chardonnay. “Geisha girls?” said [MASK], looking at me coldly.
<name>Howard</name>	Howard	Tom	[MASK] said I should listen to neither of them, not flirt, not lecture but merely be an aloof, coolly professional ice-queen. Men, he claims, view themselves as permanently on some sort of sexual ladder with all women either above them or below them.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Magda	Then I resolved serenely to tell no one, as gossip is a virulent spreading poison. Instead I will ring [MASK] a lot and be there for her so if anything is amiss (which she is bound, with woman’s intuition, to sense), she will tell me.
<name>Cyril</name>	Cyril	Tom	“The thing that makes me really angry is that they say it isn’t a beauty contest but really it is. I mean, I’m sure if it wasn’t for this nose . . . ,” said [MASK], staring at himself furiously in the mirror.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Daniel	Get weighed. 7:03 a.m. Return to bed in sulk over weight. Head-state bad. Sleeping or getting up equally out of question. Think about [MASK]. 7:30 a.m. Hunger pangs force self out of bed. Make coffee, consider grapefruit. Defrost chocolate croissant.
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Mark	“[MASK],” I said. “If you ask me once more if I’ve read any good books lately I’m going to eat my head. Why don’t you ask me something else? Ring the changes a bit.
<name>Shazzer's</name>	Shazzer's	Kajka	Monday 17 April 124 lbs., alcohol units 0 (v.g.), cigarettes 0 (v.g.), lottery tickets 5 (but won £.2 so total instant lottery expenditure only £3). Right. Tomorrow is [MASK]’s Motorbike.
<name>James</name>	James	Daniel	I suddenly thought this might be a trick and he was going to seduce me while the woman slipped out unnoticed. “Oooh, the kettle must be boiling,” said [MASK] suddenly, zipping my dress up again and patting me reassuringly in a way that was most unlike him.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gav	“[MASK]?” “You know. The guy you met at the Saatchi Gallery.” “D’you think he’d mind?” “No. He was really into you.” “He wasn’t. Shut-urrrrp.” “He was.
<name>Shazzer</name>	Shazzer	Rebecca	Ugh. Made me even more depressed in way cannot quite fathom. Anyway. Am going to stop feeling sorry for myself and spend morning learning newspapers by heart. Noon. [MASK] just rang, asking if I was “all right.”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Matt	Parties, parties, parties! Plus [MASK] from the office just rang asking if I’m going to the Christmas lunch on Tuesday. He can’t fancy me— I’m old enough to be his great-aunt—but then why did he ring me in the evening?
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Valentine	Is no point as no one loves or cares about me. On the way in on the tube you could see who had gotten [MASK] cards and who hadn’t. Everyone was looking round trying to catch each other’s eye and either smirking or looking away defensively.
<name>Shazzer</name>	Shazzer	Jude	[MASK] says you have to be careful, though, because if you have an obsessive crush on someone and ring accidentally when they are in, then ring off and no number is stored they might guess it was you.
<name>Bridget</name>	Bridget	Jude	As luck would have it, [MASK] had just been reading brilliant book called Goddesses in Everywoman. Apparently the book says that at certain times in your life everything goes wrong and you don’t know which way to turn and it is as if everywhere around you stainless steel doors are clamping shut like in Star Trek.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Tom	“Bzzz.” “Are you ready for this?” came his voice as we reached the top floor and he opened the door. All three of us cried out. [MASK]’s whole face was distorted, hideous yellow and black, and encased in plaster.
<name>Oliver</name>	Oliver	Becca	My brother, on the other hand, can come and go as he likes with everyone’s respect and blessing just because he happens to be able to stomach living with a vegan Tai Chi enthusiast. Frankly, I would rather set fire to my flat all on my own than sit in it with [MASK].
