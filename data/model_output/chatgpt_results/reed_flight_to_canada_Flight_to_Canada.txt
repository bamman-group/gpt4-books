<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Quickskill	The pirate extended his hand. [MASK] looked at it. “I don’t think so. Thanks for the ride, but if I ever meet you on free ground, I’m going to kill you.” The pirate chuckled. “Have it your way.”
<name>Tony</name>	Tony	Barracuda	That’s different. . “I don’t care what you call it, you syphilitic muskrat.. The girls oooo and awwwww. “Now I give you one more chanct. Who the boss?” “You are, [MASK].” The girls giggle.
<name>Lincoln</name>	Lincoln	Robin	He freed the slaves in the regions of the country he doesn’t have control over, and in those he does have control over, the slaves are still slaves. I'll never understand politics.” [MASK] is sitting up, the covers down to his naked waist.
<name>John</name>	John	Quickskill	Paid my bills. I loved him. But if I had known ...” She breaks into sobs, burying her head in the wet pillow. [MASK] walked over to the dresser where the poem lay. He didn’t want her to learn about it this way.
<name>it</name>	it	Swille	The poem had also pointed to where it, 40s, Stray Leech-field were hiding. Did that make the poem a squealer? A tattler? What else did this poem have in mind for it. Its creation, but in a sense, [MASK]’s bloodhound.
<name>Augustine</name>	Augustine	Leer	“They pardners. You see, [MASK] takes photos, and they sell them around the country. It’s a mail-order business they got. You’d be surprised how many people enjoy having a slave for a day even when they can’t touch them.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Harry	flo: Oh, about my American cousin; certainly. (Aside to [MASK]) Let’s have some fun. Well, he’s about seventeen feet high. dun: Good gracious! Seventeen feet high! flo:
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Yankee	I want that drawl back, too. You sound too [MASK], that’s part of your problem. But tomorrow you goin to look fine. Like nothing ever happened. You gon look chaste—not too chaste, though, a wee bit coquettish, refined.
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Mitchell	And then a clammy-looking hand . . . well, not exactly a hand. It was a human figure, but not exactly; the skin belonged to that of a crocodile, but the head—oh no—the head, it was [MASK]’s head.
<name>Marie</name>	Marie	Carpenter	A Native American. And she stuck out her chest. “Don’t you remember her, [MASK]? She came to your party.” “Oh, that’s right. I was a little high that night. Don’t remember everybody who came.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quickskill	The pirate chuckled. “Have it your way.” [MASK] climbs into the canoe. The man prepares to row to the shore. “One more thing,” the pirate says. “I read your poem ‘Third World Belle.’ It was a giveaway.
<name>Vladimir</name>	Vladimir	Davis	“I can arrange anything. They called my father God’s God, Mr. President. [MASK] may hate your flag and you, but everybody salutes our flag. Gold, energy and power: that’s our flag.
<name>Cassius</name>	Cassius	Lincoln	“I’m a small-time lawyer and now I find myself in the room of the mighty, why—” “Cut the yokel-dokel, [MASK], I don’t have all day. What’s on your mind?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quickskill	We didn’t want to carry out the body before all of those milling visitors and so we stuffed him and put him downstairs in the lower floor. He’s there now, standing in a huge log boat next to a shaman figure.” [MASK] wasn’t listening.
<name>Ragnar</name>	Ragnar	Jack	I'll take you across. This yacht has a thirty-thousand-dollar motor.” “You know, [MASK], you’re not such a bad guy. What’s wrong with you? Why are you ... I mean, so mean. Raiding villages.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Gladstone	He takes one of the whips to his bosom and rubs it. “My cowskin one! A kiss for you! My bullwhip! A caress for you! My chains. My beautiful chains. If [MASK] could only see these. My paddles.”
<name>Titus</name>	Titus	Adventure	There was always plenty. And now that slaves are big in the papers, you went and took one, for diversion. [MASK]. And those chapbooks you bought and those bum Bohemian friends of yours, those . . . those ‘Franklins’!”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Quickskill	Some of the slaves are leaving the plantations, and some do not desire to leave at all. They are even following the Mistress from town to town. Strange indeed. A mystery. [MASK] turns on the radio.
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Leechfield	You, [MASK], irrational, bitter. You still see me as a Castle black, some kind of abstraction. If we don’t pull together, we are lost.” “I’m not going to put in with no chumps. What do you know?
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Quickskill	She started to pout, real cute, though she got all suffragette and curt when he called her “cute.” She held her hands behind her back and began to look disappointed. “[MASK], there’s a den downstairs; let’s go down and have a drink.
<name>Charlemagne</name>	Charlemagne	Arthur	Listening to [MASK] and his knights, so refined and noble that they launched a war against the Arabs for the recovery of an objetd’art, yet treated their serfs like human plows, de-budding their women at will; torturing and witchifying the resistance with newfangled devices.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Swille	“It’s all right.” “Yeah, but with [MASK] gone, who’s going to pay the bill?” “Yeah, who’s going to pay the bill?” the medium one said. “I’ll pay. I’ve taken over the books.
<name>the tour guide</name>	the tour guide	Quickskill	She had her knees drawn up and was reading a chapbook. The poems of a New Englander. They were about lobsters, aunts and religion. “Oh, I didn’t mean to interrupt you. I got lost from the main tour,” [MASK] said.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Robin	What are we going to do with all of this space, [MASK]? We’re not used to living like this. All we need is an apartment. They say there are fifty rooms in this place. What are we going to do with fifty rooms?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Judy	“You sit down, girl,” she said to [MASK]. “That’s my job. You’re not the head of the kitchen any more. You’re supposed to raise lilacs, sew flags and have teas for the ladies nearby.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Lincoln	Steaming hot. What’s wrong with you, man, you gone pass up some of this good old Southern hospitality?” [MASK] shrugs his shoulders. “Well,” he says, smiling, “I guess one little cup won’t hurt.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Quickskill	“\\hiat did you say?” “I said it’s just a niggardly lie.” “Why, you—” [MASK] rushes around the desk and nabs the pirate, lifting him up. They begin to struggle.
<name>Death</name>	Death	Swille	and we were married in Death . . . Please—” She grabs her brother and then is all atop him. He falls against the fireplace, and she is laughing, staring into his eyes from her gaping skeleton sockets. Fighting and screaming, [MASK] backs into the fire.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tom	She didn’t even use your interview. Used [MASK] over at the Legree plantation. What did she give you?” “She just gave me a flat-out fee. I bought a pig, a dog and a goose with it.” “Ha!
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Raven	“Take me with you, [MASK]! Please take me with you!” “But—” “This country is violent, just like my Columbia professors said. They said it had no salvation. They said they didn’t expect most of us to live out our lives in this cacophonous rat trap.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Quickskill	Vitamin C.” “Would you gentlemen come in,” [MASK] said, escorting them into the room of Shaker furniture. They walked across the waxed hardwood floors and sat down. “Can I offer you something?” he asked, cool. “No,” they said.
<name>Edmund Wilson</name>	Edmund Wilson	Davis	[MASK], who was accused by The Charleston Mercury of treating Southerners like “white Negroes,” misread his people. It wasn’t the idea of winning that appealed to them. It was the idea of being ravished. Decadent and Victorian writing both use the romantic theme of fair youth slumbering.
<name>Queen</name>	Queen	Satan	No reason? Will we ever know, since there are so few traces left of the civilization the planters called “the fairest civilization the sun ever shown upon, ’’ and the slaves called “[MASK]’s Kingdom. ”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Dickens	He reached for her arm. “Don’t you touch me. Leave me alone. I was tired of reading [MASK] and so I took your manuscript out of the suitcase. I read the poem. Why didn’t you tell me? Why didn’t anyone?”
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Robin	“But suppose they paid you off. Would you try to recover even then?” “Look, [MASK], if they’d came to me and if they’d asked to buy themselves, perhaps we could have arranged terms. But they didn’t; they furtively pilfered themselves.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Leer	“Hold it, man. Don’t get excited. Now sit down.” Meekly, [MASK] sat down. (What was going on here? What was this strange bond between them? A white bondsman and a black bondsman in cahoots in some enterprise.)
<name>Thea</name>	Thea	Bangalang	She gives orders with her head. Pointing in this direction, that direction. Tapping her foot when annoyed. Giving some eye-dagger when mad. Not smiling but showing a wee twinkle when pleased. [MASK] is second in command, following through, taking inventory of every detail.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Drowned	Your name ought to be turkey. That’s what you are, a turkey. [MASK] because he’s too stupid to bend his head from the raining sky. You turkey.’-’ “Don’t call me a turkey.” “You fucking shithead turkey, turkey!
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Moe	In the middle of the night, while he was sleeping, she had left the hotel. . . and to [MASK], my white house slave, I leave my checkerboard and my checkers because, you see, we found it was a sport he enjoys.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Swille	a bullet comes from the direction of the window and shatters the bottle. The contents spill to the floor. “Why, I’ll be . . .” [MASK] says, staring at the pieces of glass on the floor.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Davis	Saturday. [MASK] claims he tried to wrestle his captors to the ground from their horses. He is a proud patrician with a “chiseled” nose and tells the Union soldier to kindly take his “buckrah” hands off of him.
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Leechfield	I pull in more in a day than you do in a whole year. You green, man. Brilliant but green. You one green Negro.” “Listen, [MASK], I didn’t come in here to get in an argument—” “House nigger.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Quickskill	“See, [MASK], the difference between you and me is that you sneak, while I don’t. You were the first one to hat, but you did it in a sneaky way. What kind of way was that, we thought.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Quickskill	She could put the palms of her feet on the top of your bush, so limber was she. She was extremely good doing limber things. She wore Western boots, denims. She recognized [MASK] and began that smile that made you feel that the top of your brain pan was coming off.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Quickskill	And that’s not all, there’s rumors going around what he’s done to you, I . . . I . . “What rumors, [MASK]?” “Oh, I . . . don’t want to say.”
<name>Circus clowns</name>	Circus clowns	Automobiles	Gaaa! Ga! They both were capable of producing cliff-hangers, as she was now. She reached the other side and the crowd went wild, joining hands and jumping about, whistling, stomping their feet. [MASK] were honking, policemen were blowing whistles.
<name>Randall</name>	Randall	Swille	“You keep away from me.” She is now holding the gun with two trembling hands. [MASK] continues to move toward her away from the fireplace in which every log is afire and heating the entire room. “I’ve been watching you . . .
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Barracuda	You mean she won’t eat at all?” “She told me to mail this letter. I thought I’d show it to you. See what you thought about it before I mailed it.” “Very thoughtful of you, [MASK].”
<name>Grant</name>	Grant	Lee	You’ll decide what’s best. I know that the war is even-steven right now, and this gold will help out. I’ll take a chance on your little Union. The nerve of that guy [MASK].
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Quickskill	Lace cuffs. Jewelry. “Man, two guys just tried to confiscate me. Put a claim check on me just like I was somebody’s will-call or something,” panted [MASK]. “Kvetch! Always kvetch!” “What do you mean kvetch?
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Swille	Some say it’s due to [MASK]’s bitterness about the unfortunate and untimely death of his son, the anthropologist, whose head was returned to him in a box, covered with what a biopsy revealed as cells from a disgruntled crocodile.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Carpenter	“It was in the newspapers. His old lady burned him.” “That’s nice.” “What? I expected to hear a bigger response than that.” “To tell you the truth, I don’t really care at this point, [MASK].
<name>he</name>	he	Carpenter	They made drinks in the den. She had a double vodka on the rocks with a twist of lemon; he, some red wine. He got up and turned on the television set. This was a nice room that [MASK] had made in the basement of his house.
<name>Mark Twain</name>	Mark Twain	Cato	I bought a pig, a dog and a goose with it.” “Ha! Ha! Eeeee. Ha! Ha!” [MASK] stands in the hall and slaps his head. “One of the best sellers of all time and you only received pig money.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Abe	The Military Man reaches over and carves some salmon, which rests in a china platter, an idiot look on its face, surrounded by sliced lemons. “Strange times, don’t you think, General? What happens to such people in these times? I think [MASK] must have gotten nigger fever.”
<name>Bell Hooks</name>	Bell Hooks	Leechfield	[MASK] says with a sneer. “Did you really think that it was just a matter of economics? Did you think you could just hand history a simple check, that you could short-change history, and history would let you off as simple as that?
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Raven	Did you see how they swarmed about me? They love me, [MASK]! They love me!” She stretched her arms. “I'm out in the open now. Only me and an audience. Put in the open where dance should be.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Lincoln	Well, look, [MASK], I don’t want that war to come up here because, to tell you the truth, I’m not the least bit interested in that war. I hate contemporary politics and probably will always be a Tory.
<name>Tyler</name>	Tyler	Barracuda	[MASK] knees her in the mouth. She falls back, blood spurting from the wound. “Now get up, I say!” She is lying in the middle of the floor, her blondish-streaked orange-grey hair spread out before her, moaning.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Swille	Anyway, [MASK] says he got the solution from the hormone of a reptile, and that this Tennyson fellow wrote a poem about it. One depressing work, if you’d ask my opinion. All about immortality and ennui. These people down here don’t seem to do nothin but despair.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Swille	Silence. [MASK] entered his own room. It was time for a “Siesta” he noted by looking at his watch. He walked over to his closet and opened it. “Ah, there they are. Don’t they shine? Aren’t they wonderful?
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Lincoln	Can’t you make this thing go faster?” “Yessir,” the aide says. “Right away, sir.” He leans out of the window and instructs the coachman to go faster. [MASK] opens his purse and examines the five-dollar Confederate bill.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Quickskill	He takes [MASK] to the window. “Look up there.” He points to the mountains above the river. “I can hide up there for twenty years and don’t have to worry. If you got caught, you wouldn’t know what to do.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cato	“They’re in contact, so it seems, with slaves in the rest of the country, through some kind of intricate grapevine, so [MASK] my graffado tells me. Sometimes he gets blackened-up with them so’s they won't know who he’s working for.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Arthur	That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it, [MASK]? I’ve become just like her . . “I don’t follow you, dear—” Just then there was a giggle—a shrill giggle, arising from some remote decaying city, deep under and far away.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Quickskill	Stunned, [MASK] shakes his head, and before the pirate is about to follow through, knocks the wind out of him with a short, savage right to the stomach, and then ... a splash! They stop.
<name>Abbie</name>	Abbie	Swille	And when some of you ran away, we provided you with a map, and so some of us are traveling all over the country pleading for the Cause. So what if we get eggs thrown at us and are beaten unconscious? [MASK] was the one who stirred up rivalry among us.
<name>Mr. Bradley</name>	Mr. Bradley	Quickskill	“Can I offer you something?” he asked, cool. “No,” they said. [MASK] clasped his hands on a knee, lifting his feet off the floor a bit. “Now, you gentlemen said that you were going to repossess me.”
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Quickskill	“None of your goddam business, [MASK]. Look, man, don’t you worry about me. We supposed to be free, aren’t we?” “That’s true.” “Then don’t handcuff yourself to me.” “What do you mean?”
<name>Abe</name>	Abe	Lincoln	He had on alligator shoes. He was wearing that top hat, too, and was puffing on a cigar. Look like [MASK]’s hat. That stovepipe. He said it was okay to do it. The ‘others’ had approved.”
<name>probably General Lee</name>	probably General Lee	Judy	They whips people when they ain’t even done nothing. They had a party the other night—the gentlemen from the Magnolia Baths, and they was whipping on each other too.” “It’s the war, [MASK]. Making everybody nervous.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Leechfield	He had served his contract and was now at liberty. He and [MASK] were inseparable. When he plopped into the chair the Immigrant rustled his newspaper in annoyance. His hair was wild, uncombed black curls, and he kept brushing some away from the left side of his forehead.
<name>Master</name>	Master	Barracuda	Their ethnicity.” “That I’ve done, suh. It was mighty helpful of you and [MASK] to end all them cults and superstitions and require that all the people follow only the Jesus cult. That make them work harder for you. Boss.
<name>Antoinette</name>	Antoinette	Whitman	“Isn’t it strange? [MASK] desires to fuse with Nature, and here I am, involuntarily, the comrade of the inanimate, but not by choice.” “I don’t understand,” they said together. “I am property. I am a thing.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Cato	The way you find a fugitive, remember, is to go all the way back and work your way up to him. That poem has trapped him once and it’ll trap him again. Now you go to it, [MASK].” “Yessir.”
<name>Uncle Tom</name>	Uncle Tom	Swille	That [MASK] couldn’t go to the bathroom, I’ll bet, without an escort or someone showing him the way. And do you know what he subsists on?” “What, sir?” “Slave mothers’ milk.” “What?”
<name>Calmer</name>	Calmer	Cato	They gibbed me a Ph.D. Don’t you remember?” “1 do, [MASK]. [Calmer] I hear the slaves calling you names, vilifying you. Don’t pay any attention. Jump over the broom with any of the tar wenches you see.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Tennyson	[MASK], he’s an aesthete, Mr. President.” “Well, I’ll be as dull as a Kansas moon. You say he’s what?” “An aesthete. He knows about flowers, reads poetry aloud lying on French Impressionist picnic grass.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Quickskill	“I’d love to, lad. Do you have it with you?” “It’s in my cabin. I’ll be right back.” [MASK] ran to the cabin, almost knocking down one of the lakers, he was so excited.
<name>Lucynell</name>	Lucynell	Barracuda	“Why, I’m on strike, [MASK]. I refuse to budge from this bed till my husband treats me better than he treats the coloreds around here.” “Now, I’m gon tell you one mo time. Git out dat bed!”
<name>Scyld Berry</name>	Scyld Berry	Sadists	“What on earth is that, son?” “Something to do with whips. But sometimes screws. [MASK] have closets full of lashes. They trade fettering devices.” “But we do that all the time down here, son.”
<name>Abe</name>	Abe	Hoosier	Said ‘Good luck, [MASK].’ Now I know what he meant.” “It was a close call, when the Confederates came up to the house just now. You should have seen the secret service men in the next carriage scramble from the Queen Mary.
<name>Maude</name>	Maude	Jack	“Hold on, whatever you are,” said [MASK]. “You know it’s not even been determined whether you’re a human being. I pay my taxes. Contribute to the March of Dimes. Someone has to get the goods to the market.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Swille	[MASK] is at the liquor cabinet reaching for the Old Crow, when, zing! a bullet comes from the direction of the window and shatters the bottle. The contents spill to the floor. “Why, I’ll be . . .”
<name>Ethan</name>	Ethan	Harriet	[MASK] made enough money on someone else’s plot to buy thousands of silk dresses and a beautiful home, “One of those spacious frame mansions of bland and hospitable mien which the New England joiners knew so well how to build. ’’
<name>Von Humboldt Fleisher</name>	Von Humboldt Fleisher	Tennyson	And do you know what he subsists on?” “What, sir?” “Slave mothers’ milk.” “What?” “It’s supposed to reverse the aging process. Said he got the idea from some fellow named [MASK].
<name>Mardi Gras</name>	Mardi Gras	Endymion	It was the idea of being ravished. Decadent and Victorian writing both use the romantic theme of fair youth slumbering. Fair youth daydreaming. Fair youth struck down. In the New Orleans Mardi Gras, that great Confederate pageant, the cult of [MASK] has a whole evening.
<name>Rock</name>	Rock	Lincoln	“Look, [MASK], if you don’t want to be a duke, it’s up to you. I need a man like you up in my Canadian mills. You can be a big man up there.
<name>God</name>	God	Quickskiiiillll	“Oh, [MASK].” She’d draw it out. His finger moved underneath her short white panties, which were embroidered around the edges with lily designs. He dug that, the contrast. Those denims and those panties. The denims now down over her ankles.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Leechfield	You writing poems. [MASK] with that Jew . . .” “Listen, I’ll have none of that.” “He is, though. He is a Jew. He call me a Mint, why come I can’t call him a Jew?
<name>Chief Bromden</name>	Chief Bromden	Robin	Sure was lively out in the woods when they had them horn cults, blacks dressed up like Indians. Everybody could act a fool, under controlled conditions.” “I dpn’t follow you sometimes, [MASK], but what you say makes a lot of sense.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	asa	Do you want to make me jealous? [MASK]: Oh, no, you needn’t get your back up, you are the right sort too, but you must own you’re small potatoes, and few in a hill compared to a gal like that.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lincoln	I don’t yen for no fancy flies.” “Think about it, [MASK]. You can take an hour and a half putting on your clothes down here. Why . . . why . . . I’m thinking about taking up Meditative Transcendentalism.
<name>Mammy</name>	Mammy	Swille	Just sucking my thumb and rolling my hair up into pickaninny knots. I never even gave spooks much thought, but now that they’ve become a subplot in this war, I can’t get these shines off my mind. My dreams... She must do [MASK] a lot of good.”
<name>Father</name>	Father	Gladstone	“Why ... I don’t follow.” “[MASK] is a leading Sadist. He’s into flagellation. He . . . he whips himself. Mother, tortures and beats himself.” “Oh my God, you mean your father is mixed up with that outfit?”
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Buchanan	[MASK] said there’d be days like this. No wonder he was trembling when he shook my hand at the inaugural ceremony, and when I was sworn in—whiz— he took off down the platform steps. Said he had to catch a train.
<name>Frederick</name>	Frederick	Lincoln	But... well, sometimes I just think that one man enslaving another man is wrong. Is wrong. Is very wrong.” [MASK] pounds the table. “Well, I won’t try to influence your decision, Mr. President.
<name>Napoleon</name>	Napoleon	Barbarian	And you use lines like ‘the mountain of success.’ You ought to study the ‘masters’ and then you won’t be so given to using lines like the mountain of success. You . . . you . . .” “Go on and say it. [MASK].

<name>Fitzgerald</name>	Fitzgerald	Raven	The violet sun was setting behind the Virginia hills. Soon it would be night. A night so black the stars looked like scattered sugar crystals. That was a strange letter from [MASK] this morning. I’m glad he’s doing my book.
