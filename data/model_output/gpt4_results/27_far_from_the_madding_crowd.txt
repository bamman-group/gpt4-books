<name>Donald</name>	Donald	Coggan	"How can I help pushing ye when the folk behind push me?" said [MASK], in a deprecating tone, turning without turning his body, which was jammed as in a vice. There was a silence; then the drums and trumpets again sent forth their echoing notes.
<name>Farfrae</name>	Farfrae	Gabriel	Standing beside the sheep already shorn, they went on talking again. Concerning the flock? Apparently not. [MASK] theorized, not without truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon it.
<name>Farfrae</name>	Farfrae	Bathsheba	[MASK]'s eyes, shaded by one hand, were following the ascending multitude against the unexplorable stretch of blue till they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees spoken of. A process somewhat analogous to that of alleged formations of the universe, time and times ago, was observable.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Liddy	Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, [MASK]? I know it must be ever so much past seven. Come to my room as soon as you can; I want you to give my hair a good brushing."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Fanny	I fancy I heard his voice late last night; and so, knowing something was wrong -- -- " "Is he at home?" "No; he left just before I came out." "Is [MASK] taken away?" "Not yet.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Mechanism	[MASK] only transfers labour, being powerless to supersede it, and the original amount of exertion was not cleared away; it was thrown into the body and arms. She was exhausted, and each swing forward became fainter. At last she swayed sideways, and fell.
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Gabriel	he sitting on the top o' rick, whizzing his great long-arms about like a windmill." "He does work hard." said the young woman on horseback, looking up at [MASK] through her thick woollen veil. "I wish he was shepherd here.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Fanny	The flowers so carefully planted by [MASK]'s repentant lover began to move and writhe in their bed. The winter-violets turned slowly upside down, and became a mere mat of mud. Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Boldwood	[MASK] was standing by the fireplace, and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising from her promise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment to have observed their peculiar manner, and their looks askance. "What is it you are in doubt about, men?"
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Troy	" [MASK] duly exhibited them. "Then there's pursuing practice, in this way." He gave the movements as before. "There, those are the stereotyped forms. The infantry have two most diabolical upward cuts, which we are too humane to use.
<name>Heyst</name>	Heyst	Troy	" He handed [MASK] a small packet. "You have everything ready -- it seems that you calculated on my accepting them." said the sergeant, taking the packet. "I thought you might accept them."
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Bathsheba	" "That's a terrible wooden story." At this criticism of her statement [MASK] made an addition to her dignity by a slight sweep away from him. "Upon my heart and soul, I don't know what a maid can say stupider than that."
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Henery	This was recognized by all as the conclusion of some gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought alone during the shake of the head; [MASK] meanwhile retained several marks of despair upon his face, to imply that they would be required for use again directly he should go on speaking.
<name>Fanny</name>	Fanny	Fanny	"If I had not turned up she might have become en- gaged to you." "Hang might!"Would, then." "If you had not come I should certainly -- yes, certainly -- have been accepted by this time. If you had not seen her you might have been married to [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Liddy	"I've been through it, [MASK], and it is over. I shan't mind it again, for they will all have grown accustomed to seeing me there; but this morning it was as bad as being married -- eyes everywhere!"
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Oak	Some were beginning to consider [MASK] a "near" man, for though his condition had thus far improved, he lived in no better style than before, occupying the same cottage, paring his own potatoes, mending his stockings, and sometimes even making his bed with his own hands.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Boldwood	[MASK] compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her light laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house; and the door closed again. "Gracious heaven, I didn't know it was like that with him!"
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Boldwood	He said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it. [MASK] remained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again just audible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be distinguished coming down the hill.
<name>Leggatt</name>	Leggatt	Poorgrass	said [MASK]. "I looked hard at en, as if I would read his very soul; and there was mercy in his eyes -- or to speak with the exact truth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was towards me."
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Fanny	"Because she's dead in the Union." "[MASK] dead -- never!" "Yes, ma'am." "What did she die from?" "I don't know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was from general weakness of constitution.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Oak	said [MASK], "that his life is a total blank whenever he isn't hoping for 'ee; but I can't suppose-i hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy. His natural manner has always been dark and strange, you know.
<name>Abel</name>	Abel	Cainy	By this time [MASK] was nearing the group of harvesters, and was perceived to be carrying a large slice of bread and ham in one hand, from which he took mouthfuls as he ran, the other being wrapped in a bandage.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Oak	wouldn't think of giving such trouble to neighbours in washing up when there's so much work to be done in the world already." continued [MASK] in a moister tone, after recovering from the stoppage of breath which is occasioned by pulls at large mugs.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Gabriel	"[MASK], will you stay on with me?" she, said, smiling winningly, and not troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end, because there was going to be another smile soon. "I will."
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Bathsheba	What woman in [MASK]'s position, not naturally timid, and within call of her retainers, would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear a price? "All in good time; it will soon be done, I perceive," said her cool friend.
<name>Stranger</name>	Stranger	Miss	She seemed to prefer a less tragic probability; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of such a deed -- and she shunned it. "I believe you saved my life, [MASK] -- -- I don't know your name.
<name>Today</name>	Today	Inwardy	The gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style, in a new coat and white waistcoat, quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of grey. [MASK], too, he was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional degree.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Frank	"Only such a few weeks ago you said that I was far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that you would give them all up for me; and now, won't you give up this one, which is more a worry than a pleasure? Do, [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Liddy	" she went on, allowing herself to be further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously forbidden. "But you know they think so?" "No -- that is -- I certainly have heard [MASK] say they do, but -- --" She paused.
<name>Legree</name>	Legree	Troy	"I wish to speak a word with you." he said. "What about?" "About her who lives just ahead there -- and about a woman you have wronged." "I wonder at your impertinence." said [MASK], moving on.
<name>Donald</name>	Donald	Hullo	She was no otherwise than a girl mind, and how could she tell what the man was made of? If 'tis really true, 'tis too hard a punishment, and more than she ought to hae. -- [MASK], who's that?
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Ay	"[MASK], and she wore a beautiful gold-colour silk gown, trimmed with black lace, that would have stood alone 'ithout legs inside if required. 'Twas a very winsome sight; and her hair was brushed splendid.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Bathsheba	Many of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing being quick and short, whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended. "O, what can I do, what can I do!" said [MASK], helplessly.
<name>Costigan</name>	Costigan	Turpin	" "I can't." But the play must proceed." "Do you give out that [MASK] has got a bad cold, and can't speak his part, but that he'll perform it just the same without speaking." The proprietor shook his head.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Oak	And yet I trust my hope. It is faith, not hope. I think this time I reckon with my host. -- [MASK], my hands are a little shaky, or some- thing; I can't tie this neckerchief properly. Perhaps you will tie it for me.
<name>David</name>	David	Oak	[MASK] could pipe with Arcadian sweetness and the sound of the well-known notes cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers. He played on with spirit, and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute man.
<name>May</name>	May	Ma'-ay	I sow'-ed the'-e seeds' of love', I-it was' all' i'-in the'-e spring', I-in A'-pril', [MASK], a'-nd sun'-ny' June', When sma'-all bi'-irds they' do' sing. "Well put out of hand.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gabriel	"Perhaps she's not there." [MASK] shook his head. The soldier turned a little towards the east, and the sun kindled his scarlet coat to an orange glow. "But it is a nice old house.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Miss	"Well [MASK]-excuse the words-I thought you would like them But I can't match you I know in napping out my mind upon my tongue. I never was very clever in my inside. But I thank you. Come give me your hand!"
<name>He</name>	He	Boldwood	"It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!" she said, fairly beaten into non-resistance. [MASK] pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap. "I am happy now." he said.
<name>Javert</name>	Javert	Troy	" said [MASK]. "Is it she?" "It is." He had originally stood perfectly erect. And now, in the wellnigh congealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient movement, as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a while.
<name>Singleton</name>	Singleton	Oak	He sat down. His head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, [MASK] decided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall asleep.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Laban	"I didn't like to ask for her after all." [MASK] faltered out. "They were all in such a stir, trying to put a little spirit into the party. Somehow the fun seems to hang fire, though everything's there that a heart can desire,
<name>Estella</name>	Estella	Bathsheba	"Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed; a blissful loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage -- O [MASK], say them!" he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of mere friendship any longer.
<name>Job</name>	Job	Coggan	added [MASK], "that whenever he do really make up his mind to do a noble thing in the shape of a good action, as I could see by his face he. did to-night afore sitting down, he's generally able to carry it out.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Troy	you were miles away, or dead! Why didn't you write to me?" said [MASK] to the woman, in a strangely gentle, yet hurried voice, as he lifted her up. "I feared to." "Have you any money?"
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Gabriel	He jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy dawn, and ascended the hill. The forward ewes were kept apart from those among which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred of the latter class in [MASK]'s flock.
<name>Lenora</name>	Lenora	Fanny	Stopping the home, he listened. Not a footstep or wheel was audible anywhere around, and the dead silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from a tree through the evergreens and alighting with a smart rap upon the coffin of poor [MASK].
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Bathsheba	Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words, and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in- structor as he spoke. "That will do." exclaimed [MASK]. "Loose my hands. I won't have them held! Turn the winch."
<name>Jan</name>	Jan	Jan	"It might have been a little more true to nater if't had been spoke a little chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just now. "That improvement will come wi' time." said [MASK], twirling his eye.
<name>Leafy</name>	Leafy	Matthew	"Ten and twopence halfpenny is the sum put down to you, I see?" "Yes, mis'ess." said [MASK], as the rustle of wind among dead leaves. "Here it is and ten shillings.
<name>Jan</name>	Jan	Jan	"Ye be a very old aged person, malter." attested [MASK] must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able to live so long, mustn't he, neighbours?" "True, true; ye must, malter, wonderful," said the meeting unanimously.
<name>Dorothea</name>	Dorothea	Oak	said [MASK], slowly. "In fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en under any condition, that is, your not caring about him -- for I may suppose -- -- " "Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting.
<name>Tess</name>	Tess	Liddy	said [MASK], with womanly dignity of a diminutive order; "but I don't wish to stay with you. And, if you please, I'll go at the end of the harvest, or this week, or to-day....
<name>Sheep</name>	Sheep	Sheep	"[MASK] are such unfortunate animals! -- there's always something happening to them! I never knew a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape or other." "There's only one way of saving them."
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Gabriel	"I think she's took against ye -- that I do." "O no -- not at all." replied [MASK], hastily, and a sigh escaped him, which the deprivation of lamb skins could hardly have caused.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Bathsheba	In her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the window, and began laying them around the dead girl's head. [MASK] knew no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by giving them flowers. She knew not how long she remained engaged thus.
<name>Godfrey</name>	Godfrey	Gabriel	It hardly was credible that such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a diabolical sound. "How terrible!" she exclaimed, and clutched him by the sleeve. [MASK] turned, and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding her arm.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	T'hor	Now -- the first man in the parish that I hear prophesying bad of our mistress, why" (here the fist was raised and let fall as [MASK] might have done with his hammer in assaying it) -- "he'll smell and taste that -- or I'm a Dutchman."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bathsheba	Perceiving that she hesitated, he added, "I myself shall not stay to see it: I've seen it before." Now [MASK] did care a little to see the show, and had only withheld her feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joseph	etc., etc. It was a relief to [MASK]'s heart when the friendly signboard came in view, and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to fulfil an intention made a long time before. His spirits were oozing out of him quite.
<name>Jude</name>	Jude	Oak	Voices were to be heard inside. [MASK]'s hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to an Elymas-the-Somerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap, which he pulled. This lifted a wooden latch, and the door swung open.
<name>He</name>	He	Troy	You knew what married life would be like, and shouldn't have entered it if you feared these contingencies." [MASK] had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in her throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full.
<name>Jan</name>	Jan	Gabriel	"Chok' it all! I lived through the summers, didn't I? That's my question. I suppose ye'll say next I be no age at all to speak of?" "Sure we shan't." said [MASK], soothingly.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Coggan	But how was we to know, if you left no account of your doings?" expostulated [MASK], "and ladies don't drive at these hours, miss, as a jineral rule of society." "I did leave an account -- and you would have seen it in the morning.
<name>Lucetta</name>	Lucetta	Miss.	"The tailboard of the waggon is gone, [MASK]" said the waggoner. "Then I heard it fall." said the girl, in a soft, though not particularly low voice. "I heard a noise I could not account for when we were coming up the hill."
<name>Unity</name>	Unity	Oak	So down she sat, and down sat he, the fire dancing in their faces, and upon the old furniture all a-sheenen Wi' long years o' handlen, that formed [MASK]'s array of household possessions, which sent back a dancing reflection in reply.
<name>Lucetta</name>	Lucetta	Fanny	The clocks struck the hour, and no [MASK] appeared. In fact, at that moment she was being robed in her grave-clothes by two attendants at the Union poorhouse -- the first and last tiring-women the gentle creature had ever been honoured with.
<name>Ted</name>	Ted	Gabriel	She might have looked her thanks to [MASK] on a minute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt none, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we know how women take a favour of that kind.
<name>Joseph</name>	Joseph	Jacob	"And you mean, ma'am, excusing my words, that a young woman would hardly go to see her young man without dressing up." said [MASK], turning his mental vision upon past experiences. "That's true -- she would not, ma'am."
<name>Eleanor</name>	Eleanor	Fanny	Perhaps I am a bad man -- the victim of my impulses -- led away to do what I ought to leave undone. I can't, however, marry them both. And I have two reasons for- choosing [MASK].
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Joseph	"A pretty maid as ever I see! But what's yer hurry, [MASK]? The pore woman's dead, and you can't bring her to life, and you may as well sit down comfortable, and finish another with us."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bathsheba	[MASK]," he said, tenderly and in surprise, and coming closer: "if I only knew one thing -- whether you would allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after ali-if I only knew that!" "
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Troy	[MASK] was full of activity, but his activities were less of a locomotive than a vegetative nature; and, never being based upon any original choice of foundation or direc- tion, they were exercised on whatever object chance might place in their way.
<name>Jan</name>	Jan	Liddy	"I wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a harpsichord, dulcimer, pianner, or whatever 'tis they d'call it?" said the maltster. "[MASK] saith she've a new one." "Got a pianner?" "Ay.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Liddy	If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they say there's no chance at all." "I do so hope his life will be spared." said [MASK]. "If it is not, she'll go out of her mind too.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Oak	Occupied this, with eyes stretched afar, [MASK] gradually per- ceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no such thing. It was an artificial light, almost close at hand.
<name>Lucetta</name>	Lucetta	Fanny	He could put off the consideration of any particular spectre till the matter had become old and softened by time. The planting of flowers on [MASK]'s grave had been perhaps but a species of elusion of the primary grief, and now it was as if his intention had been known and circumvented.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Liddy	"What a heavy rain we've had in the night, ma'am!" said [MASK], when her inquiries about breakfast had been made. "Yes, very heavy." "Did you hear the strange noise from the church yard?" "I heard one strange noise.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Oak	Will you sit down, please? Here's a chair, and there's one, too. I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and are rather hard, but I was thinking of getting some new ones." [MASK] placed two or three for her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bathsheba	[MASK], suppose you had real complete proof that you are what, in fact, you are -- a widow -- would you repair the old wrong to me by marrying me?" "I cannot say. I shouldn't yet, at any rate."
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Bathsheba	Deeds of endur- ance, which seem ordinary in philosophy, are rare in conduct, and [MASK] was astonishing all around her now, for her philosophy was her conduct, and she seldom thought practicable what she did not practise. She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers are made.
<name>Pegasus</name>	Pegasus	Poppet	"I think you do." "Think if you will, and be -- -- " The sentence was completed by a smart cut of the whip round [MASK]'s flank, which caused the animal to start forward at a wild pace. No more was said.
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Bathsheba	Beyond the first enclosure was a hedge, and on the other side of this a meadow belonging to [MASK]'s farm. It was now early spring -- the time of going to grass with the sheep, when they have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid up for mowing.
<name>Coggan</name>	Coggan	Coggan	And you be now going down to the clerk." "Yes; you may as well come with me." "I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away." said [MASK], as they walked along.
<name>Gabriel</name>	Gabriel	Gabriel	"We hear that ye can tell the time as well by the stars as we can by the sun and moon, shepherd." "Yes, I can do a little that way." said [MASK], as a man of medium sentiments on the subject.
<name>Rawdon</name>	Rawdon	Liddy	Heaven and my Love forgive me. And don't you know that a woman who loves at all thinks nothing of perjury when it is balanced against her love? There, go out of the room; I want to be quite alone." [MASK] went towards the door.
<name>Levin</name>	Levin	Coggan	"Twill help us." A light was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before, and the ex- amination made, "Hurrah!" said [MASK]. "She walked up here -- and well she might. We shall get them in two miles, for a crown."
<name>Clerval</name>	Clerval	Bathsheba	Indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel. I shall shortly leave the army because of the same conviction. Now after that revelation of how the land lies with [MASK], 'twould be a mistake to kill me, would it not?"
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Bathsheba	The air was big with [MASK]'s fortunes to-night: every word everywhere concerned her. When they were quite out of earshot all by one instinct paused. "It gave me quite a turn -- his face."
<name>Lydgate</name>	Lydgate	Oak	Where the issue of an interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better, any initial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of failure. [MASK] went up to the door a little abashed: his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of opening.
<name>Lucetta</name>	Lucetta	Oak	"So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that." said [MASK], pausing. "Yet I must tell him to- night, I suppose, for he's working so far off, and leaves early."
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Bathsheba	A rusty patch immediately upon the verse, caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon, told that this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the purpose. "Now keep steady, and be silent." said [MASK].
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Gabriel	" said [MASK], gently. He wondered that the request should have come at this moment, for the strife was over, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human habitation, and the hour was getting late.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Bathsheba	"No, indeed." said [MASK], with serene indifference "His pew is exactly opposite yours, miss." "I know it." "And you did not see his goings on!," Certainly I did not, I tell you."
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Bathsheba	"Well, what is your opinion of my conduct." she said, quietly. "That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek, and comely woman." In an instant [MASK]'s face coloured with the angry crimson of a danby sunset.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Bathsheba	He liked saying `[MASK]' as a private enjoyment instead of whistling; turned over his taste to black hair, though he had sworn by brown ever since he was a boy, isolated himself till the space he filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness.
<name>Oak</name>	Oak	Gabriel	At her third ascent the rick suddenly brightened with the brazen glare of shining majolica -- every knot in every straw was visible. On the slope in front of him appeared two human shapes, black as jet. The rick lost its sheen -- the shapes vanished. [MASK] turned his head.
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Bathsheba	"Quite ready." said [MASK]. "Though I didn't tell them to send." "It is a stranger, ma'am." said the man by the door. "A stranger?" she said. "Ask him to come in."
<name>Oyvind</name>	Oyvind	Gabriel	There was then a silence everywhere for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars, as [MASK] hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly heard. He thought the crisis of the storm had passed. But there came a burst of light.
