<name>the officer</name>	the officer	Blackbeard	If you’ve got nothing to hide—” “ ‘You’ve got nothing to fear’?” I said. “I know that one, and it’s never true.” I shoved [MASK]’s hand off my shoulder and turned to face him.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Camlach	He seemed concerned more for my son than for himself. It was all he said.’’ “So I heard.” said [MASK]. The silence came back. They stared at one another. She said: “You would not.” He didn’t answer.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Cadal	The sun was warm. [MASK] nodded on his bench, half asleep. From across the yard a movement caught my eye; in a shadowed doorway the girl was standing, watching my mother’s door as if waiting for me to come out.
<name>Stanhope</name>	Stanhope	King	If my lord [MASK] would have patience, the pumps had jammed, but the engineers were working on them and meanwhile the men had rigged a windlass and were passing buckets ... All was well again, the pumps were going now and the level was dropping sharply . . .
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Uther	But she paid no attention. She slid out from the shadows and, quickly and lightly, ran up the steps to [MASK]’s door. I heard the sentry challenge, then a murmur, and a soft laugh from the man.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Demetrius	“I’ll have to go! [MASK] won’t say anything, but if I’m late for supper they’ll ask why." “And you don’t intend to tell them?” “No, or they’d stop me coming again."
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Puzzled	I could see in the King’s face nothing that was not at once ferocious and innocent, a kind of eager satisfaction like a child’s, or a wild beast’s when it sees its prey loitering nearer. [MASK], I held my tongue and waited.
<name>Tormund</name>	Tormund	Ambrosius	[MASK] laughed. “If you ride that poor beast of yours in your usual fashion you’ll be warm enough without. And if your cloak is dabbled with the blood of the Bull, then it’s not for you, tonight, is it?”
<name>God</name>	God	Mithras	If she’s still there, of course.” Then, with a savagery that broke through me so suddenly that I had hardly known it was there: “By [MASK], I’d give a lot to know who did that up yonder!”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Uther	I can feign sickness here, until [MASK] finds he has to let me go home. We could go home without insult, and without bloodshed.” I said sharply: “You said you would listen. Time runs short.” She was still again.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name to fill in the [MASK] token.)	Belasius	This isn’t just a question of sacrilege, then? Your ceremonies are so very secret? Is this a matter of a mystery, [MASK], or is what you do illegal?” “It is both secret and illegal. We meet where we can.
<name>Cicero</name>	Cicero	Uther	He picked up the stilus, looked absently down at the wax, and added a word. I waited. He scowled down at what he had done, scored it out again, then threw the stilus down and said abruptly: “[MASK] has been to see me.”
<name>Cersei</name>	Cersei	Gorlois	She smiled a little wryly. “I was preparing the way, too, not to sit beside the King at the feast.” “So far, good. You will tell [MASK] that you are pregnant.” ‘‘That I am pregnant?"
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Gorlan	Even to myself I had hardly admitted what came sometimes with light and fire; dreams, I had told myself, memories from below memory, figments of the brain only, like the voice which had told me of [MASK], or the sight of the poison in the apricot.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rocked	He shot me a look, scowled, and then grinned. ‘You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. You stood up to them a fair treat. Beats me how you thought of all that stuff quick enough. [MASK] ’em proper.
<name>Morgause</name>	Morgause	Olwen	At first I thought the woman in the high-backed chair on the other side of the hearth was [MASK], the Queen, but then I saw it was my mother. She had been sewing, but her hands had dropped idle in her lap, and the white stuff lay still over the brown robe.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Maugan	“They tell me,” he said, “that a king’s stronghold should be built on blood." “They are talking, of course, in metaphors?” I said politely. [MASK] suddenly struck his staff on the floor of the dais.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Ulfin	As we passed I saw the curve of a bare shoulder and a tumble of straight brown hair. She looked very young. I raised my brows at [MASK], and he nodded, then jerked his head towards the shut door with a look of enquiry.
<name>Eric</name>	Eric	Cadal	“Only since I rode in tonight. It was something [MASK] said, then I remembered things, and how your brother stared tonight when he saw me wearing this.” I touched the dragon brooch at my neck. He glanced, then nodded.
<name>Catti-brie</name>	Catti-brie	Cadal	“By the dog, so it is.” [MASK] looked him up and down. “You look a sight better than you did then. What happened to the druid? Died of a curse? Come along then, and get something to eat.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Cadal	He was honourably received and acquitted himself well, but soon afterwards, in some minor engagement, received wounds of which he later died. As for me, I never saw him again.) [MASK] shut the door behind him.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Camlach	But it was an accident, and he’s dead . . . and you with all your friends were a good twelve miles away. So you’re King now, [MASK], and there is no man can point a finger at you and say, ‘He wanted his father dead.’ ”
<name>Rooster</name>	Rooster	Cadal	[MASK]’s voice said, low and urgent: “This way." A hoof sparked on stone. “I got you a quiet one,” he said, and put a hand under my foot to throw me into the saddle. I laughed a little.
<name>Tyrion</name>	Tyrion	Cerdic	Then I ran back to [MASK], pulled aside the coverlet, and, kneeling, fumbled at his hip. They had left his dagger. I tugged at the clasp with fingers that were clumsier even than the darkness made them, and it came undone.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Belasius	If you ask me, [MASK] has the right ideas. His servant doesn’t even dare to speak, let alone argue. I ought to treat you the same way— in fact I’ll start straight away . . . What are you grinning at?”
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Vortimer	I understand he has married a young wife, and it may only be that he kept within walls all winter to keep her warm. Or that he foresaw what would happen to [MASK], and preferred to serve my cause by staying safe and apparendy loyal to the High King.
<name>John</name>	John	Belasius	It sliced its way uphill through the forest to a crest from which, momentarily, one could see the glimmer of the town’s lights. Then it plunged downhill again, and after a while we rode out of the forest on to the salt plains that fringed the sea. [MASK] neither slackened speed nor spoke.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Merlin	You don’t sleep even then?” “No.” He set down the goblet beside him, and knitted his hands together. “It’s no use. Nothing is any use. You must bring her to me, [MASK]. You have the arts.
<name>Scudamore</name>	Scudamore	Cadal	I waited beside the stone. He left the troop some little way off, and rode forward with only one companion. I did not think they had yet seen me, though they must have seen the flicker of [MASK]’s dying fire in the hollow.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Galapas	He was looking down at the thing under the blackthorn bushes. “[MASK]?” I nodded. “I saw the mess down by the cave. I guessed." “I hadn't realized I had been here so long." “Leave this to me.”
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Moravik	He choked over his beer, then with deliberation wiped the foam away, set down the horn, and regarded me with exasperation. “Now how in middle-earth do you think I know that?” “I thought [MASK] might have told you.”
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Ambrosius	She was playing some game of her own, and was secure in her own mind that this would avert whatever danger threatened me. I knew, for certain, that she would say nothing of [MASK]. But still, everywhere in the hall, was death.
<name>King Uther</name>	King Uther	Vortigem	So [MASK] held council with his wizards, who told him that he must search for a lad who never had a father, and when he had found him should slay him and sprinkle his blood over the foundations, to make the tower hold firm.
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Vortigern	It was not clear exactly what had happened, but the rumour was that he had died of poison treacherously administered by a familiar of the Queen. Whatever the truth of the matter, he was dead, and [MASK] his father was once more in command.
<name>Mr. Rochester</name>	Mr. Rochester	Aster	I had a few falls, but got nothing worse than bruises, and managed to attract no attention, good or bad, from anyone who mattered. Nor did I find what I was looking for; I saw nothing, and nothing happened except that my horsemanship improved, and [MASK]’s manners along with it.
<name>Renfield</name>	Renfield	Belasius	Across his head [MASK] said to me: “I shall tell the Count of your progress. He will be pleased.’ The expression on his face was as near a smile as he ever showed. Made bold by this, I turned on my stool.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Uther	“Is all well?” I heard him exclaim, and he took a pace, pressing closer to the horse’s shoulder, peering upwards in the dark. Behind me [MASK]’s grey hoisted itself up the track and thudded to a halt.
<name>Aragorn</name>	Aragorn	Cadal	It was no wonder they left no sentries here. And the path to the secret gate could be held by one man against an army. [MASK] was saying: “I’ll get the horses in there, under the overhang, in what shelter there is.
<name>you</name>	you	Alun	“I have not said it. I’m just telling you that the quarrels here are over. The kingdom’s yours—and now it’s as [MASK] says, you had better go and speak to the people.” “To you first.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Uther	We are bound to stay until he gives us leave to go. If we go in that manner, for whatever reason—” I stopped her. “[MASK] can do nothing on the day of the crowning. He must stay here for the days of feasting.
<name>child</name>	child	boy”—I	“No matter of that, you should be wed, and soon. I’m an old man, and these are troubled times. As for this [MASK] froze again—“forget him. Whoever sired him, if he hasn’t come forward in six years, he’ll not do so now.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Camlach	A wasp, disturbed from the tree, droned past between us. [MASK] flapped at it with a queer, abrupt gesture, and said to me in a voice that was suddenly all venom: “Keep away from me after this, you devil’s brat.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Cadal	There was silence except for an owl starting up, and far away on the edge of sound another, like its echo. “It’s pitch dark twenty feet away,” said [MASK]. “I can’t see a thing. Did you hear him stop?"
<name>The Beast</name>	The Beast	Uther	"Quite true. I knew it straight away, before I even thought you might be my son, when I saw how you faced [MASK] that night in the field, with the vision still in your eyes, and the power all over you like a shining skin.
<name>Joffrey</name>	Joffrey	Dinias	His father had thrashed him with his own hands, and afterwards given him a dagger with a gilded hilt. [MASK] claimed the title of Prince— at any rate among the rest of the children—from then on, and treated his fellow-bastard, myself, with the utmost contempt.
<name>Edie</name>	Edie	Keri	“Oh, if that’s all, come here. It’s all right, I’ll show you, just come here.” “No.” I tried to put her aside gently, but I was shaking. “No, [MASK]. Leave me.
<name>Kurtz</name>	Kurtz	Vortigern	“The pool is empty?" asked [MASK]. “Yes, sir." “And what lies beneath?" The officer paused. He should have been a bard. He need not have paused to gather eyes: they were all on him already.
<name>Juliet</name>	Juliet	Ygraine	I drew breath, and wiped the sweat from my face. I straightened up from where I had leaned against the ramparts. My body was stiff, but the ache had gone. I looked up at [MASK]’s darkened window where, now, they slept.
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Vortigern	[MASK] leaned forward. “You are certain of this? You drained it to the bottom?” “Indeed, sir.” He signed to the men beside him, and three or four of them stepped forward to tip a clutter of objects in front of the platform.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Uther	They’re talking about it in there, but you could hardly call it a trial. The Count’s said nothing as yet, but [MASK]’s roaring to have him killed, and the priests want a bit of cold blood to round the day off with.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Keri	When I took leave of her she was still sitting staring past the winking amethysts on the wall to something distant in place and time. [MASK] was not waiting, and I lingered for a while before I crossed the outer yard, slowly, towards the gate.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Ambrosius	I had the freedom of the camp and the town, and with [MASK]’ name to back me I took to this freedom like a hungry young wolf to his first full meal. I learned all the time, from every man or woman I met.
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Tremorinus	“It is something that every old wife swears she can do. And you—you have power beyond any man living. You lifted the Hanging Stones. You lifted the king-stone where [MASK] could not.” “My mathematics are better, that is all.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gorlan	Well, go on.” The brown mare was pushing at me, snuffing sweet breath at my neck. I handed her away. “That’s all. [MASK] is angry, but they’ll give him something.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Galapas	I gave him the slip, along with the others. But I could have trusted him, even about you. [MASK], if I’d stayed—if I’d been there—perhaps I could have done something.’’ “No. You counted for nothing.
<name>Blackie</name>	Blackie	Rufa	I said impatiently: “I’m going, anyway. You can follow or not, as you choose.” I jerked [MASK]’s head up and away from him, and kicked her with my good foot, so that she plunged forward past the grey pony.
<name>Bonaparte</name>	Bonaparte	Gilloman	The second battle was short, and bloodier than the first. But it took place in the night, and in the confusion of the melee [MASK] himself escaped once more, and galloped away with a handful of men, this time nobody knew where.
<name>the boat</name>	the boat	Cadal	Except for the driving arcs of white foam, the bay where [MASK] waited was invisible under darkness. It had stopped raining now, and the clouds were running higher and thinner. The wind had veered a little, slackening. It would drop towards dawn.
<name>Prince</name>	Prince	Ygraine	Then I said: “What do you want of me, [MASK]?” She answered crisply, with no pretense: “I have sent for you, Prince, because I want your help.” 1 nodded. "In the matter of the King.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Merlin	“[MASK]—” “Yes?” “You’d be wise if you said no more of this to anyone. Not to anyone. Do you understand?” I said nothing. “These are matters that a child doesn’t understand. High matters.
<name>Orpheus</name>	Orpheus	Galapas	I said, trying it out on the emptiness. “[MASK]?” There was the faintest of whispers from the crystal cave, a ghostly sweet humming like the music I had once listened for in the night. Nothing human; I had not expected it.
<name>Strephon</name>	Strephon	Cadal	Men that have god’s-sight, I have found, are often human-blind. I said to [MASK]: “Everybody knows?” He nodded. He didn’t ask what I meant. “It’s rumoured. You’re very like him sometimes.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gorlois	The only other woman’s room that I had seen was my mother’s, with the plain wooden bed and the carved oak chest and the loom, and the cracked mosaics of the floor. I walked forward and stood at the foot of the bed, looking down at [MASK]’ wife.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Blackbeard	And let me tell you, sir, I’m mightily glad to see you safe. It was feared you’d died in the fire." [MASK] hadn’t even glanced at him. He was directly between me and the door. He never took his eves off me.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Galapas	And [MASK] with them. I went slowly towards the mouth of the cave. I paused by the spring. I could see why there had been no sound; someone had filled in the basin with stones and earth and more wreck- age thrown out of the cave.
<name>Dumbledore</name>	Dumbledore	Belasius	The expression on his face was as near a smile as he ever showed. Made bold by this, I turned on my stool. “[MASK]—” He stopped halfway to the door. “Well?” ‘You must surely know . . .
<name>Black Beauty</name>	Black Beauty	Cadal	If you look at my pony when he comes in—” “Oh, yes, that was true. I’ve no doubt I’ll find he’s lame. And if I send men back up the path they’ll find [MASK] leading him home.
<name>Moses</name>	Moses	Vortigern	His eyes narrowed. “Yes.” “Then what [MASK]’s prophet said must still hold good.” “I can tell the men this?” “If they need it. When do you plan to march?” “In three days.”
<name>The pilot</name>	The pilot	Hanno	I expect they’ll put the fire out before it reaches the King’s apartments.” He regarded me in silence for a minute. We were still racing with the turning tide, well out in the estuary now. [MASK] gave no sign of steering to the further bank.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Cerdic	I gave the torch back to [MASK]. He hadn’t spoken. He was watching me all the time with that sidelong, white-eyed look. I touched his arm. “We can go back now. This thing’s nearly out anyway. Come on.”
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Merlin	“Thanks, but no. I came for your help, [MASK], for my wife.” The quick eyes peered under the grey brows. “Aye, no one could ever tell what you were thinking, but you’ve heard, haven’t you?”
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Vortigern	I’ll come. But first I must go and help [MASK] uncover the dragons." I made for the door, but he got there ahead of me, and paused with his hand on the latch. His eyes were scared.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Tremorinus	It was after supper when [MASK] came to me. I could see the torches and the fires still lit at the top of the hill, throwing what was left of the Dance into relief. His face was grimy, and he looked tired.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Cerdic	I slipped from the saddle at the stableyard gate, fully prepared to find myself locked out, but even as I reached to try it the gate opened, and [MASK], with a shaded lantern in his hand, beckoned me in. “I heard you coming.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Cadal	For the rest I read, and walked on the hills, and gathered plants and made medicines. I also made music, and sang a number of songs which made [MASK] look sideways at me over his tasks and shake his head.
<name>bed</name>	bed	Cerdic	“Where is she?” “She went with my mother.” “Then you’d best come with me. I’ll fix it up.” So it was that the cut on my cheek-bone was dressed with horse-liniment, and I shared [MASK]
<name>Theodora</name>	Theodora	Ulfin	The whisper faded into the flutter of the torch and the sound of the storm outside. I was alone on the stairway, and above me a shut door. [MASK] had not moved. I lowered my empty arms and went back to the fire.
<name>unknown</name> (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	unknown (There is not enough information in the passage to determine the proper name that fills in the [MASK] token.)	Merlin	But you, [MASK], if you move or speak again before I give you leave, you will be taken from the hall.” The sword withdrew from my side, but the man still held it ready. The guards stood back half a pace from me.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Uther	I’d come myself, only I’m keeping out of his way.” “Why?” “When we tossed for the girl, he lost,” said [MASK] cheerfully. “He’ll have plenty of time to look after you. In fact, all night.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Uther	When his brother bothered such a lot with you, had you in his house and set me to look after you and all that, [MASK] thought that’s what must be going on, and he didn’t half like it.” “I see.
<name>Igor</name>	Igor	Cadal	The heating system certainly worked here; the water was steaming hot, and thawed my frozen body in three painful and ecstatic minutes. The man who had carried me home—it was [MASK], who turned out to be one of the Count’s personal servants— bathed me himself.
<name>Jon</name>	Jon	Merlin	I saw him slant a look at me. “I have spoken to you tonight as I have spoken to no man before. Do you hold the past against me, [MASK] the bastard?” “I hold nothing against you, my lord.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Cadal	The spring ran crystal clear, and crystal clear through the water of the well could be seen the silver gravel at the bottom. Above it, in its ferny niche, stood the carved figure of the god; [MASK] must have found it when he cleared the rubbish from the well.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Cadal	Haven’t you scared the toe-nails off me a score of times with what you say and the things you see that no one else can see?” “You used to be scared of me, didn’t you, [MASK]?” “In a way.
<name>Paris</name>	Paris	Uther	It cannot be taken from the land, and it cannot be approached by sea. If you wish to shut me away for ever from [MASK], this is the place to send me.” “So I have heard.
<name>my father</name>	my father	Ambrosius	Twenty minutes later, in a dark blue tunic clipped at the shoulder by the dragon brooch, I went to see my father. The secretary was in the anteroom, rather elaborately doing nothing. Beyond the curtain I heard [MASK]’ voice speaking quietly.
<name>Grindelwald</name>	Grindelwald	Galapas	“Perhaps,” said [MASK]. ‘You’re more likely to be clapped in your cage sooner than you expected.” But he said it absently, as if his mind were elsewhere, and I went back to what concerned me most.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Belasius	The boy obeyed, trying, I could see, not only to excuse himself, but to gauge the strength of [MASK]’ anger. “My lord, please believe me, I said nothing. I’ll swear it by any gods there are.”
<name>France</name>	France	Winchester	“The first time you stood beside this stone in the night, men say you saw visions. Now they tell me in [MASK] that as he lay dying he spoke to you as if you were there in his bedchamber, standing at the foot of the bed.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Camlach	The town was alive with torches, men running to meet the galloping horse, but [MASK] paid no heed to them. He drove the spiked spurs into the horse’s sides, and galloped straight through the town, down the steep street, and into the outer yard of the palace.
<name>he</name>	he	Dinias	It was time to be gone. I nodded, and he withdrew. As [MASK] glanced to see whom I had signalled to I threw again, and flicked a settling six over with my sleeve. One and three.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Camlach	“[MASK]? He was a fool. I told him which way the wolf would jump.” But as he spoke I saw his eyes slide sideways towards the shadows. It seemed that men watched their tongues these days in iWaridunum. His eyes came back to me, suspicious, wary.
<name>Caspian</name>	Caspian	Vortigern	“For [MASK]’s men will come back this way,” I told them. “They are not to know that the High King is already fleeing eastwards: they will come back by this road, so we will wait for them here, and you will be wise to wait with us.”
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Ulfin	But they moved one to each side of the head of the steps, and their swords were still in their hands. Behind me, I heard the faint whisper as [MASK]’s blade loosened in its sheath. Under my cloak, mine was half-drawn.
<name>Calypso</name>	Calypso	Galapas	Then I told him everything, up to the quarrels in the palace and my mother’s tears. “It was the same cave, [MASK], that I’ll swear! But why? There was nothing there. And nothing else happened, nothing at all.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Cadal	Yes, I’m finished, take it away.” I pushed the tray into his hands, and threw back the bed-covers. “[MASK], are you trying to tell me I said this in my— delirium?” “Aye.
<name>T'Challa</name>	T'Challa	Vortigern	The stream was a full three hundred paces off, dark under its oaks and willows. [MASK] signed to me to take my place on the platform beside him, and I mounted it to stand at his right, on the opposite side from the priests.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Uther	“I am not [MASK].” “Well, it takes both sorts, as they say.” He dumped the blankets on the bed. “What are you smiling at?” “Was I? Never mind.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Gorlois	“I see. Has anything yet been said between you and [MASK]?” “No.” “But he must know.” “It is the same with him as with me. If once this thing comes to words, nothing can stop it.
<name>Melchizedek</name>	Melchizedek	Ambrosius	Tell me what I said?” “You gave me a kingdom. And you gave me immortality. What more is there? Drink now, [MASK]’ prophet. “Not wine. Is there water?” “Here.” He got to his feet.
