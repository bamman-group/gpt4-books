<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Emma	You might know the healer. She's one of [MASK]'s granddaughters. Over a period of weeks, she regenerated the stump that I had left into a new hand. Even now, ten years after my transition, I don't understand how she did it.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Vivian	Actually, I only sensed a human shape beside her—a body. I was aware of it in the way I was aware of the lamp on the night table beside it. 1 could read [MASK]'s thoughts with no effort at all.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Rachel	Alive, you could grow into something impressive and worthwhile." "All seven of us," said [MASK] bitterly. "If you survive as a group, you won't be only seven long. Your numbers are small because I've deliberately kept them small.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Doro	"If that's what you felt, I'm surprised you didn't go ahead and take the rest of us." "It's possible that she was only saving the rest of you for another time," said [MASK]. "But I don't think so.
<name>Millicent</name>	Millicent	Rachel	She swallowed, nodded. "Do you understand what [MASK] does? Do you see that you are to her, and to the others, what she is to her congregations?" "A kind of mental vampire draining strength... or something from people. Strength?
<name>John</name>	John	Seth	He had lived on the property as a recluse until his death, a few months back. [MASK] had bought the property from his surviving daughter, now an adult. He had bought it in the hope that his latent brother might finally find peace there.
<name>Rachel</name>	Rachel	Doro	"You're right. I want to bring latents through for my own satisfaction. I admit that. I want them here around me. But as for why...." I shook my head. "You don't have to kill," said [MASK] quietly.
<name>Myfanwy</name>	Myfanwy	Mary	"I finished my transition this morning," said [MASK]. "And then, as if that wasn't enough, this other thing, this pattern, just sort of snapped into existence. Suddenly I was holding six other actives in a way that I didn't understand.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jesse	When the "noise" finally lessened, when it didn't fill every part of [MASK]'s mind, he realized that he was on the ground. He started grog-gily to get up, and the man whose anger he had mentally encouraged kicked him in the face.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Ada	He frowned. "I don't see why." "Everything was too new. You were all on short fuses. You and [MASK] hadn't gotten together and mellowed each other, so one or both of you would have been against me.
<name>Thrax</name>	Thrax	Doro	If anything happened to her, the pattern would die with her. It was possible that her actives, new and old, would revert to their old, deadly incompatibility without it. [MASK] would lose a large percentage of his best breeding stock.
<name>Chappie</name>	Chappie	Clay	Instead of doing that, I think you might have turned your ability inward a little and caused your own heart to stop." [MASK] shook himself. "I could have. I didn't know what I was doing, most of the time."
<name>Devlin</name>	Devlin	Seth	"That your brother's not a latent any more," I said. "That he's headed toward transition." There was a moment of complete silence. Then came quick, bitter disappointment radiating from both men. They didn't believe me. [MASK] spoke quietly. "
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Doro	If she had not married him, she might be saying these things to her parents—her stepparents—the only people besides [MASK] whom she could ever remember loving. It had been very important once—that she protea her parents from what she had become.
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Momma	"I talk as decent as you taught me, [MASK]! Besides, what do you want me to say? 'Make love to him?' I wouldn't have loved it. And if he had managed to do it, I would have made sure I killed him."
<name>John</name>	John	Doro	Now, dead, he was again a burden in spite of all her efforts to see that he was safe. If only [MASK] had not insisted that she have children. She had been looking forward to his return for so long.
<name>Ruby</name>	Ruby	Rachel	That was why the taxi driver, who was black too and who knew the church at the address she gave, asked her sympathetically whether she was going to see "that traveling faith healer." "I'm going to see her, all right," said [MASK] through her teeth.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Jesse	It kept him on his feet when he should have fallen, kept him fighting, well after he was beaten. When he finally did collapse to the ground, it kept him conscious and aware—aware solely of pain. [MASK] walked away and left him lying there.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Jesse	[MASK] was only vaguely aware of the beating his body was taking as he struggled to close out the mental blast. But there was no way to close it out. No way to dull it as it screamed through him.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Mary	I should be telepathic, like [MASK]. If I were, I would have created a pattern and fed off live hosts instead of killing. As it is, the only time I can feel mind-to-mind contact with another person is when I kill.
<name>Alonzo</name>	Alonzo	Doro	I remember once when I was about six years old I was sitting on his lap frowning up into his latest face. "Shouldn't I call you 'Daddy'?" I asked. Until then, I had called him [MASK], like everybody else did.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Doro	"But, then, you're no stranger to ugly stories." He paused. "She was an alcoholic, my mother. And she wasn't exactly normal— sane—during those rare times when she was sober. [MASK] says she was too sensitive.
<name>John</name>	John	Seth	The place was isolated, all right. It was a bad place to get sick. And [MASK] was getting sick. It wasn't the heat—or, if it was, the wind blowing through the van window wasn't helping. He felt worse than ever.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Mary	"I've got to see it for myself, [MASK]. I've got to be certain. I can't... do what you're asking until I've seen for myself that it's necessary." I read him, saw that he was telling the truth.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rina	And sometimes even if he knocked her around and called her names that trash like him didn't have the right to call anybody. I used to wonder how [MASK] could live with herself. Now, apparently, I was going to find out.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Em	He had never commanded her again. "Will you take the mother and child, [MASK]?" "Yes. You know I will. Poor things." "Not so poor if I'm successful." She made a sound of disgust. He smiled.
<name>Marvin</name>	Marvin	Seth	"Why did I give you...? How could you make me...? What's going on here?" [MASK] shrugged. "Nothing now." "How do you know who I am? Why did I hand you...?"
<name>He</name>	He	Vivian	"Is she going to be all right?" [MASK] asked. "I think so." "Are you going to be all right?" "If she is, I will be." She got up, came to rest one hand on his shoulder.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Doro	It had been two weeks since their marriage, two weeks since she had called him back to her bed, he hadn't gone out of his way to hurt her since then. He watched [MASK] maneuver the car into the right lane so that they could get on the Forsyth Freeway.
<name>Talia</name>	Talia	Jan	[MASK] resisted the temptation to reach into her thoughts and leam at once what was wrong. That part of her ability was still underdeveloped, because she did not like to use it. She enjoyed touching inanimate objects and winding back through the pasts of the people who had handled them before her.
<name>Elayne</name>	Elayne	Karl	They spend most of their lives sharing other people's pain and slowly going crazy. Why should they have to go through that if I can give them a better way?" "Are you so sure it is better?" asked [MASK].
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Dangerously	I've made him wary and uncomfortable. I've been moving too fast, and letting him see me too clearly." "It sounds as though you're saying he's afraid of you. And if you believe that, you're deluding yourself. [MASK].
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Rachel	"I don't like this one damn bit. And this is the kind of thing you want me to handle?" "There are too many of them for me," said [MASK]. "The more help I get, the fewer of these bad ones will die."
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Nubians	"I don't know of any of my people who are descended from [MASK]. Certainly none of them were descended from my parents." "You were an only child?" "I was one of twelve. I survived, the others didn't.
<name>Pattem</name>	Pattem	Seth	"You would anyway. But, all right, I'll do your dirty work for you." She turned and went down the driveway. She was a rare Pattemist. Like [MASK], she cared what happened to the people she had left behind in the mute world.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jan	1 remembered [MASK] suddenly and looked at her. She stared back, round-eyed. "How about you?" I said. "No!" 1 thought she was going to get up and run out the door again. "No."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Emma	I could hear her and her company yelling at each other way out on the sidewalk. 1 walked around the corner and knocked on [MASK]'s door. She opened it, looked at me, stood back from the door. I went in and sat down in the big overstuffed chair near the door.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Rachel	The totally deaf child gained hearing, but the one-armed man— he had come to get help in his fight against alcoholism—did not grow a new arm. He could have. It would have taken weeks, but [MASK] could have handled it.
<name>Seivarden</name>	Seivarden	Jan	The fragment has been buried for most of the time between our lives and hers. That's the only reason there was any of her left in it at all." "Now there's nothing but her. How did you get rid of the others?" [MASK] frowned.
<name>Healer</name>	Healer	Rae	And healers were very efficient at getting rid of irritants. "What kind of call did you receive, [MASK]?" he asked. "Was it like a verbal command, or like—" "It was like getting hit with a club at first," she said.
<name>Thonolan</name>	Thonolan	Rachel	That was true enough, but it was going to hurt her if she didn't stop emphasizing it. [MASK] had already all but dismissed her as having no real importance. She was an irritant. No more. And healers were very efficient at getting rid of irritants.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Clay	A slender, fragile-seeming thread, like a shadow of one of the comparatively substantial strands of my actives. But it was a pattern strand. Somehow, [MASK] had become a member of the pattern. How? I could think of only one answer.
<name>He</name>	He	Mary	I'll do the best I can." "I had intended to stay." She didn't bother hiding her relief He got up and went to her. [MASK] There were incidents as my actives straggled in.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Rachel	"Work?" "Right. Jobs, interests, goals." I had been thinking about it for days now. "They can make their own jobs. It will give them less time to bitch at me. [MASK] can have a church if she wants one.
<name>the MASK</name>	the MASK	Clay	But what could I do? I shifted my attention back to [MASK]. There was a glimmer of something just as I shifted—like the glimmer of a fine spider web that catches the light just for a second and then seems to vanish again. I froze.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jamie	Now he watched to see how she handled it. He seemed surprised when, days later, she gave him charge of her cousin [MASK], but he accepted the responsibility. After that, he seemed to relax a little.
<name>Yolanda</name>	Yolanda	Rachel	He's the last member of our 'family' to come in. He came in a little madder than the rest of you." I could feel [MASK] sweep the downstairs portion of the house with her perception.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doro	"Of course you were. The trick is not to tell everyone about it." She looked at him again, frowning, her small, expressive face a mask of concern. "[MASK], 1 saw them in my mind and they didn't scare me.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Clay	We'll need one." "What we?" demanded [MASK]. "Well, you, then. You don't want to have to fight with that thing every time you want to eat, do you?" "Never mind the stove.
<name>he</name>	he	August	And I planted some instructions that she wouldn't need or remember until [MASK] showed signs of approaching transition. I didn't want her panicking then, and taking him to a doctor or a hospital. Maybe 1 needn't have worried.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doro	He looked at me. "You've got to tell us how you know... how after all these years this could happen." So they were beginning to believe me. "I'll have to talk to you after I see what [MASK] wants," I said.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Emma	"Wait a minute! He may have left me more clues to whatever the hell he's doing than I thought." "What?" "I'll get back to you in a minute." I reached out to the old neighborhood, to [MASK].
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Clay	"[MASK] lost any chance he had for becoming an active over ten years ago," he said. "Ten years ago he didn't have the pattern to help him along." "I find it hard to believe the pattern is helping him now.
<name>Myron</name>	Myron	Doro	Even then I knew that was a hell of a put-down to the guy. Our house was a shack compared to what he was used to. Anyway, [MASK] wanted to find out whether the guy was stealing, having real trouble, or was just plain incompetent.
<name>Rowan</name>	Rowan	Doro	Somehow, though, when [MASK] said the same thing in different words, it didn't bother me as much. Well, why did I want to see as many latents as possible brought through transition? So I could be an empress? I wouldn't even say that out loud.
<name>Chigurh</name>	Chigurh	Doro	The rest of the floor was bare wood—no carpeting. [MASK] took in all this without surprise, without changing his neutral expression. He uncovered the child, saw that she was sleeping nude, saw the bruises and welts on her back and legs.
<name>Alai</name>	Alai	Ada	Finally it was done. She had learned the needs of the children and overcome her own shyness enough to meet those needs. On paper, mutes still owned the school. But [MASK] and her Pattemist assistants owned the mutes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jan	The neighborhood had changed little in the three years since [MASK] had seen it. New cars, new children. Two small boys ran past her; one of them was black. That was new too. She was glad her mind had not been open and vulnerable when the boy ran past.
<name>Alaric</name>	Alaric	Jan.	"She was all I ever wanted to sense," said [MASK] "The fragment has been buried for most of the time between our lives and hers. That's the only reason there was any of her left in it at all."
<name>Frances</name>	Frances	Mary	There was another long silence. "You always want so damn much. Shall I give up men, too?" "If I come back and find [MASK] black and blue again, I'll take her. If anything worse happens to her, I'll kill you."
<name>He</name>	He	Em—"He	"But she's mine." "You wouldn't be thinking about killing her if you believed that was enough." "[MASK] got up and went to sit on the arm of her chair. "What are you afraid of?" "Your Mary."
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Doro	[MASK] came up behind me, put his hands on my shoulders, and massaged gently. "Calm down a little," he said. "I know you feel good, but calm down." "High," I said. I grinned at him.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Doro	But he knew he had about as much chance of getting a lie past [MASK] as he did of getting one past me. He closed his mouth for a moment, then said, "Easier or not, I don't like it any more now than I ever did.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Jan	Nothing went back further than a decade. Nothing carried real historical memory. Everything was sterile and perilously unanchored to the past. A little girl of no more than seven was standing in one of the yards watching [MASK] walk toward her.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Eli	Thus it seemed only reasonable that [MASK] take her place and preach the sermon today. And it was only reasonable that she stay at the hotel, relaxed, semiconscious, so that her body did not shake from this one illness that she was helpless against.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Doro	I didn't want her panicking then, and taking him to a doctor or a hospital. Maybe 1 needn't have worried. Maybe [MASK] would see that he was taken care of. And maybe not. I went home and managed to get through a fairly ordinary day.
<name>Elara</name>	Elara	August	Now, you can go on playing the part of their savior if you do as I've told you. Or you can destroy them by plunging on headlong as you are now." "Are you saying I have to stop recruiting until [MASK] is old enough to replace me if anything happens to me?"
<name>Medusa</name>	Medusa	Rachel	She paused for a moment. "Now I know—I just found out—that [MASK] can give me a heart attack or a cerebral hemorrhage or any other deadly thing she wants to. So I know. So what?"
<name>Trillian</name>	Trillian	Ada	The woman met [MASK]'s eyes and realized that she was really being offered a choice. "I'd rather stay," she said. "I'll have to handle this again." "All right."
<name>Alvar</name>	Alvar	Mary	His silence and his obvious anger. He wondered why he had brought her with him. Then he remembered. "You're not leaving me," he said. "But if [MASK] came through transition all right—" "I said you're not leaving!"
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Doro	Son of a bitch! I threw a fit. I finally did the yelling and screaming [MASK] had warned me 1 would do. I couldn't help it, I just went out of control. The whole thing was so Goddamn humiliating!
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Rina	1 went to the kitchen and got one of our small cast-iron skillets—the size just big enough to hold two eggs. Then I went to the door. The stupid bastard was drunk. "Hey," he mumbled. "Where's [MASK]?
<name>John</name>	John	Karl	Large, businesslike kitchen. Large, businesslike cook. She was friendly, though, and she was a black woman. That helped. Formal dining room. Small, handsome study—why the hell couldn't [MASK] work there? Game room with billiard table.
<name>Waldo</name>	Waldo	Karl	At the same time, I told her to keep her hands off [MASK]. I didn't have that good a grip on him myself at the time, but I had already decided that, whether I got him or not, she wasn't going to.
<name>Destiny</name>	Destiny	Doro	But since [MASK] is on my side, shouldn't we at least try to get along?" She turned and walked away from me. Nothing was settled and I had one more strike against me. But at least I was starting to learn to heal.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Clay	It was slow because, in spite of everything, [MASK] did not want to die. He was just becoming less and less able to tolerate the pain of living. So now a lonely piece of land. A so-called ranch in the middle of the Arizona desert.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Clay	"Looks fine. Just waiting for some electricity." "How about you?" He knew exactly how [MASK] was, but he wanted to hear his brother say it aloud. "I'm all right too.
<name>Valentine</name>	Valentine	Doro	What about me?" "Enough about you so that I'll have a chance to understand why you want us." "Why does anyone want a family?" "Oh, come on, [MASK]. Families! Dozens of them. Tell me, really.
<name>Miles</name>	Miles	Doro	"You bet I do. Or are you going to stop me from doing that, too?" "No. It will make things more difficult for you, but that's your problem." "You seem to do all right handling harems." [MASK] shrugged.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Karl	"Tell me about it while you're having breakfast," he said. "Hasn't [MASK] already told you?" "Yes. Now I want to hear it from you." I told him. 1 didn't add in any of my suspicions.
<name>Barlow</name>	Barlow	Doro	For a moment [MASK] was intoxicated with it. It filled him, blotted out all thought. The fiery threads of her Pattern surrounded him. And before him... before him was a slightly smaller replica of himself as he had perceived himself through the fading senses of his thousands of victims over the years.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Emma	Do you want us to go to prison! [MASK]: Can't you think for once in your life? Why'd you leave him here? Why didn't you at least—at least—come and get me? For God's sake, girl...
<name>Clay</name>	Clay	Eli	The power, the energy she used in a healing service had to come from somewhere. [MASK] had called her a parasite, a second Doro. He had talked her into forgoing her usual "price." She had tried, and that was why she was sick now.
<name>Matilda</name>	Matilda	Rachel	Never dared to try, because he knew that, even if he managed to succeed a time or two with great help from the sick person's own suggestibility, he would never equal [MASK]. He could never perform one tenth of the healings she performed, because she never failed.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Doro	Without another word, he turned and went back to his chair. [MASK] got up, came closer in to join the group. He sat down beside me, spoke to me softly. "I warned you." "I know," I said.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Mary	Property. [MASK]'s property. He strained against the seemingly fragile thread. It stretched easily. Then he realized that he was straining against himself. The thread was part of him. A mental limb. A limb that he could find no way to sever.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Rachel	[MASK] was conscious then. But she didn't say anything. Curiosity reached me through my private haze. I looked at her. She was crying. She wasn't making any noise at all, but her whole body shook.
<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Doro	As they grew in size and experience, they became more able to handle their own problems. [MASK] still visited them from time to time, though. Sometimes he asked favors of them. Sometimes they asked favors of him. This was one of the latter times.
<name>me</name>	me	Rachel	I let her go, opened my eyes again. Evidently, closing them was some kind of reflex. Now the others were looking at [MASK], were turning to look at me. I felt better than ever. But steadier now. No more shaking.
<name>Amber</name>	Amber	Jan	"[MASK] all over again." "Thanks." "I'm not criticizing you. Telepaths are always the worst possible parents. 1 thought the Pattern might change that, but it hasn't. Most actives have to be bulldozed into even having children.
<name>Orual</name>	Orual	Doro	"I guess the dangerous thing about her is the one you hinted at just before we went up. That if she can heal the sick, she can probably make people sick too." "I didn't say you should guess," said [MASK]. "
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Doro	"For the sake of the fifteen hundred, you'd better sayyestoit." "Yeah. I just wish I could be sure that saying yes was enough." "Why wouldn't it be?" "I might be too much like [MASK]."
<name>Rhett</name>	Rhett	Jesse	She knew she could only have him until someone else caught his eye. When that happened, he would send her home to her husband and her turn might not come again for months—might not ever come again. [MASK] smiled to himself as he read her thoughts.
<name>Dorcas</name>	Dorcas	Ada	A mute guardian who was programmed to notice such things had reported that one of her latent foster children—a fifteen-year-old girl—was having serious pretransition difficulties. From the office, [MASK] looked out at the walled grounds of the school.
<name>He</name>	He	Karl	He didn't know what he was doing. Neither did she. [MASK] caught her and held her down, thankful, not for the first time that night, that she was small. He managed to catch her hands before she could slash him again with her nails.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Doro	Now, cautiously, I started to reach into [MASK]'s mind. It was like stepping off a cliff. I jerked back instantly, thickening my screen to a shield and struggling to regain my balance. As fast as I had moved to draw away, I had the feeling I had almost fallen.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Doro	Or something was about to be wrong. Really wrong. I was picking up shadows of crazy emotions. "Why should we go?" he asked. "My head... !" I could feel myself losing control. "[MASK], please...." I screamed.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Doro	Usually, though, he prevents himself from getting into that situation by changing often and keeping to healthy, young bodies. I seem to prefer young minds—not necessarily healthy." "But with so many young minds already here, there's no reason for you to defy [MASK] and go after more."
<name>Miss Honey</name>	Miss Honey	Ada	She hides things too well sometimes. But now that I do know, I'm not going to walk out on her." "And how could I leave the school?" said [MASK]. "All the children... .
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Mary	"And the noise... mental static like the worst moments of transition. Maybe I was picking up the last of [MASK]'s transition. Then I was drawn here. There may have been words. I was only aware of images that let me see where I was going.
