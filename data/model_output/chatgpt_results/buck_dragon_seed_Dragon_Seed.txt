<name>Baba</name>	Baba	Pansiao	Behind her [MASK] trembled. “Now I have made her angry,” she whispered. Her heart caught in her breast and she wanted to weep. “Of all things I wish not to make her angry,” she thought, and was bewildered by her ignorance.
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Jade	[MASK], now, she did not grow up at your side, and so she is used to seeing with her own eyes and not yours.” “Is this my fault?” she asked, and held the comb, ready to be grieved.
<name>Mollie</name>	Mollie	V	And best of all those bold poor did who risked their lives to stay in the city and [MASK] to go into the emptied houses of the rich and take what they liked from them. These people poured like a flooding river out from the city over the countryside.
<name>Ariadne</name>	Ariadne	Pansiao	It would set her mind on such things and make her more ready for her own time and we must arrange that too.” At first they could only think of [MASK] as a small quiet creature sitting at the loom, and how could she do such a large thing as this?
<name>she</name>	she	Jade	He was so sure that [MASK] was with him somehow that he looked to see if she were at his side but she was not. For a moment he was taken aback, and all his hot blood turned cold and he felt faint with weariness and hunger.
<name>Bessie</name>	Bessie	Jade	None could have that flag here for fear of death if the enemy found it, but some had it and hid it. “Oh,” [MASK] whispered, “the free flag! You are as bold as this!”
<name>Doris</name>	Doris	Orchid	And of [MASK] she thought, “A soft good soul and I must not be so hard on her.” And she took her own little daughter’s hand and looked at the calluses that the threads had made and said, “Tomorrow you shall not weave.
<name>Aravis</name>	Aravis	Jade	His jaw fell down as he perceived her meaning. “But she is so high,” he said, “how will she ever look down on one of us? And besides, what is she to the enemy?” [MASK] looked grave then.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Jade	But there were none, and only the two pale young men, so he sat down to listen to them and there were others there and among them his third cousin and his wife and their only son, who had loved [MASK].
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	SS	“You old turnip,” she said, and searched for something she could do for him. “Come here, old man, and let me [MASK] see that spot on your cheek and see if you are to have a boil after all these years.”
<name>he</name>	he	Pansiao	If she found the man what [MASK] had said, why, then, who could tell what would happen? If the man was only a hind, she had but to go away again and call it adventure and pleasure. She took no risk on herself, whatever came about.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Jade	Without touching her he felt nearer to her than he ever had. “Then tonight we will speak together,” he said. “Yes,” she said. Her voice was so soft that it was not like [MASK]’s voice, but he heard it.
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Mayli	So she rose and opened her gate. “Oh,” she said, and then made haste to be more courteous. “I swear I am too loutish—but I am so—I did not expect you—” “Why should you?” [MASK] said.
<name>Hester</name>	Hester	Pansiao	This shame had put a cloud upon the child, and since in the village, nothing was hidden from anyone, [MASK] knew that her birth had brought mockery upon her mother. Her very name carried the mockery, though this had not been meant.
<name>pragmatic</name>	pragmatic	Chinese	“I am not a traitor. I am a realist. If we recognize the truth, that these East-Ocean people have conquered half our country, the only hope for our future is to work with them. Besides, what I am doing is thoroughly [MASK].
<name>Miss Brodie</name>	Miss Brodie	Mayli	Books were precious anc this one could be mended. But [MASK] was tramping in full fury back to the classroom “I cannot stay here,” she muttered. “I will not be paid tc stay here. I must get out.”
<name>Betsy</name>	Betsy	Jade	Then she put her hand into her bosom and took out a small piece of bright folded silk and she shook it out, and [MASK] saw the flag of the free people—blue and red, the sun upon it white and pure.
<name>Tiresias</name>	Tiresias	Mayli	A thought of cunning had come into her mind, and she crept toward a certain knowledge as a cat creeps to a mouse. “She told me of each one,” [MASK] said, “so when I saw you I knew your names.”
<name>he</name>	he	Jade	She looked so full of ease and calm that no one could have known how her heart twisted and beat inside her breast, and [MASK] did not know. And yet she told her husband afterward, “I knew it was no common day.
<name>Zero</name>	Zero	Jade	And he praised his parents that they had had the sense to dig the hole and he said to [MASK] before he slept, “We must work on that hole and dig it deep and strengthen it with posts and beams under the court and make it like a secret fortress.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Pansiao	These lashes she lifted when she had read the letter. Then she folded the letter and gave it back to [MASK] without speaking. “Where else in the world could this happen?” she thought to herself. “Who could believe it who had not seen it?
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Jade	[MASK] mused. As she spoke she peered into the bright barrel of the gun she 226 held. It was a new gun taken not long ago from some enemy and placed here with the others. She put a rod into it and moved it slowly up and down.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Pansiao	She saw [MASK] looking at her and hoping for more answer than this, and she shook her head. “Dear child,” she said. “It is all strange to me and like a story out of a book. Now you must go to bed.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Mayli	There is not one left.” “But will you be blamed for it?” [MASK] asked him. “Naturally, somewhat,” he replied. “They know I cannot help such savagery from my own people, and yet I feel its effects.”
<name>Raskolnikov</name>	Raskolnikov	Jade	If [MASK] were with this cousin of his, he would kill them both and lay their bodies in the open street for all to see. His blood came rushing up the veins of his throat and swelled into his cheeks and eyes and his right hand twitched.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Orchid	“They came to buy some foreign things, and they paid their money like any one else and they were two-legged as we are and they had all their features, and only their color and their smell were strange.” “Could they speak?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Jade	she cried, trying to be angry. But secretly in her heart she was pleased for [MASK] was beautiful and she knew against her wish that the girl was no ordinary one. “Both of you are stubborn wilful women and it is the only sort I like,” he said.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Pansiao	Now, as [MASK] grew, she had grown like her name, and she was a gentle, half-smiling, half-sad young girl, never feeling herself wholly welcome anywhere, and eager, therefore, to do all she could to win welcome.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Jade	And yet this night a little later he thought [MASK] hung back from him somewhat. “Now what?” he asked her, and stayed himself to find out what was in her mind to hold her body back.
<name>Santa Claus</name>	Santa Claus	Pansiao	The door opened and she saw [MASK] and she smiled one of her lavish rich smiles, and welcomed the child. “Sit here,” she said, pulling a stool to the brazier full of charcoal. “It is so cold.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Mayli	“That is the lesson assigned for English to-lay,” she said. “They have been learning it for a fortnight ind today the whole is to be finished.” “Why have they had such a stupid assignment?” [MASK] lemanded.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jade	This he did, and under his arm he held the book for [MASK], wrapped up in the strip of blue cotton which he wore otherwise around his neck to wipe the sweat from his face if he were hot.
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Pansiao	And [MASK], who spent her days at the loom, who never went to the city, she could not imagine the thing she had heard and it was so strange it went out of her mind like a dream told. In the house she had been kept a child.
<name>Laurie</name>	Laurie	Jade	176 And she burst out with words as though a lid had been taken from a jar: “Our house is like a grave and now I know we ought never to have let our second son and [MASK] go away from it.
<name>Susan</name>	Susan	Jade	Day after day they waited to find whom they wanted and one day there came by a party of forty or more young men and women. The women had feet as free as men, which had never been bound, and [MASK] liked them as soon as she saw them.
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Mayli	The tears filled her eyes. “I, who would have died before I made you angry with me!” Her adoration shone like a candle through her tears. She put out a timid hand and took the edge of [MASK]’s robe.
<name>than</name>	than	thaij	“I take your side,” she told her daughter, “for a more 92 helpless man [MASK] yours I never did see, though a mild temper, and that is something to be glad for, too.
<name>Corinne</name>	Corinne	Jade	Sons could not be trusted, because in a house women were stronger than men. Thus, she thought, who could believe that her second son would beat [MASK] when he found her? “He will not beat her,” she muttered into the flame.
<name>Deception</name>	Deception	Wu	She smiled and made a courteous answer, “I trouble you by coming.” “No, you do not,” he said, but he was troubled because his sons were hidden in his house. He thought to himself that it was like [MASK].
<name>life</name>	life	Heaven	How can I do it?” “How can you?” she repeated coldly. She saw within her heart that bold young face. “You cannot,” she said. . . . Thus its own way [MASK] moves toward its end.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Mayli	I have had no time for anything else.” And yet no such son-in-law had appeared. Young men had fallen in love with [MASK], but she herself had refused them, and her father had had nothing to do with it.
<name>He</name>	He	Heaven	“How he stopped like a story teller at the point to make men want more and come back tomorrow!” he said. “Still, he looked happier than ever I saw him, and let him be. We will tell no one what we know. [MASK] uses the useless.”
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Jade	“My second brother!” that one cried, “and is he here?” “Yes, and [MASK], too, and they have a fine child. Still I would not wish him mine, that child, for he is marked for an early death.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Jade	“Ought we not to understand our son and [MASK]?” he asked. “They are like us.” “I always did say our second son was more like you than any of the others,” she answered.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Jade	“I know all I want to know,” she said, beginning to comb her hair again, and making her eyes mischievous. “You do not know this,” he said. “It is because she is so much like you.” __ “That [MASK]!”
<name>Mulan</name>	Mulan	Mayli	“But I cannot stay here safe and be happy when the East-Ocean people are taking our country,” [MASK] now told her father in that foreign country. She spoke her own language badly, but she had recently determined to speak it.
<name>Miss Sullivan</name>	Miss Sullivan	Pansiao	[MASK] thanked her and took the book, and though she could not read enough yet to know what it said, it stood to her a goal to be reached some day, and she went through the book with a bit of charcoal and marked every character that she knew.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Jade	“It is only [MASK],” he told himself and yet it seemed to him that she was more strange to him than she had been on their wedding night. The flesh he could see and comprehend but what was hidden behind her pretty face and her smooth body?
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Mountains	[MASK], I come home to you! ” She stood a moment, then remembered that she was very hungry and that the old servant who had led her to the room from the gate had told her the classes would be out in a few minutes.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Jade	Her father had been richer than most men, an owner of land he rented as well as farmed, and he had a concubine and so [MASK] grew up among two women’s children and they numbered seventeen in all.
<name>Psyche</name>	Psyche	Pansiao	As for [MASK], when she found her goddess gone she wept secretly and long. Where was that goddess, and had she made her go, because she had besought her to be the wife of so human a creature as her third brother? Who could say?
<name>Jo</name>	Jo	Jade	The next morning [MASK] took those ducks into the city and gave them to the fat cook. She said nothing until she was paid, and then she said in a low voice, “Make your sauce rich for the ducks and put in extra oils and wine.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Jade	We are more lucky than the many who had all burned to ashes around them, or those who died in the ashes of their houses.” “But how did it come about with you?” [MASK] asked. “Were there bombs that fell on you?”
<name>Winnie</name>	Winnie	Jade	It was because they must be free of all that was past, that they might be ready for what was now and to come. His sons had gone beyond him. . . . “Do you hate me?” [MASK] whispered to her husband.
<name>nothing</name>	nothing	Bis	We have a handful of Chinese prls here educating them for who knows what? But not for [MASK]!” She seized the book and tore it in half and threw the pieces in the waste basket beside the desk.
<name>feeling</name>	feeling	Jade	The feeling was there, strong and stubborn, and he knew she was wrong, but how could he tell her so and make her feel as he did? This [MASK] was so mixed with large and small, and he must be sure to pluck the right part in her now.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Heaven	As for the cousin, he did not see from day’s end to day’s end a face he knew, and at last he was truly free. Thus [MASK] used this man, too, worthless as he was.
<name>Goat</name>	Goat	Ducks	[MASK] and hens, pigs and cows, all are taken, and that we have our old buffalo is only because it is so thin and old, and yet the enemy stares at it, too, and your father says one of these days it will go.”
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Jade	He took his life in his hands often, but such danger must be, and day after day that autumn [MASK] bade him farewell in the night and each knew that this might be the time when they parted never to meet, and yet neither said so.
<name>Cathy</name>	Cathy	Pansiao	“I have made you angry,” [MASK] whispered. The tears filled her eyes. “I, who would have died before I made you angry with me!” Her adoration shone like a candle through her tears.
<name>Evangeline</name>	Evangeline	Pansiao	Yet she was one of them, for her hair was black and her skin, though fair, was still their skin. [MASK] was dazed with her beauty. Under the bare board table her small chilblained hands were clasped together. She felt the sweet hot love from nowhere rush into her bosom.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Jade	“This is no usual child,” he said to his son. “Look at his face, how square it is, and he has a square mouth.” Then he saw his son look proudly at [MASK] and she as proudly at him, and he took pleasure in their mutual pride.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Orchid	But still I do grow weary with [MASK] who does nothing if I .do not tell her, and with our elder daughter who cries at me like a sheep from morning until night, ‘M-ma, what shall I do next?’
<name>Sarah</name>	Sarah	Orchid	[MASK] was one of those women who live long when they are loved and cared for, but in trouble they die soon. Now as she looked into the black faces of these lust-filled men she was weak already.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Jade	“The women buy it for themselves, be sure,” the man said quietly, and though he looked at her very closely he asked her nothing. He measured out the stuff and he sold it cheap, and [MASK] put it in her bosom and went homeward.
<name>Miranda</name>	Miranda	Pansiao	“I must not be a fool,” she thought, and went to bed. XVII She avoided [MASK] for days and often, when by chance she met the young girl’s waiting eyes, she smiled quickly and turned her head away. What those eyes asked was impossible.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mayli	Indeed they were not different, these women, except in where they had spent their lives and how. “He loved you when he first saw you,” she said. “Some men are so,” [MASK] said, and tried to smile, and wondered at how stiff her lips were.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Jade	When they had read it, [MASK] had shaken her head. “We who are young, we ought to go on and not go back,” she said. “We left that place because of the child and shall we take him there now?”
<name>Uncle Remus</name>	Uncle Remus	Mayli	When such small creatures leave a house luck goes with them.” “You are an ignorant fool,” [MASK] said, “and the enemy is welcome to such as you. What good is it to our country to have such old images as you?”
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Orchid	He rose and opened it and when he saw [MASK] he cried aloud: “Why, this woman was one who sheltered here!” “Why did you let her out?” the men groaned. “I did not,” the gateman swore, “I let no woman out.”
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Jade	Now [MASK] that day was not at work of any sort, for she moved too clumsily to be at ease. She was large with this child and she wondered that it could be so large, but so it was.
<name>God</name>	God	Heaven	That year the yield was only half what it had been the year before, and the farmers told the enemy that some years it was so with them that the straw grew very thick and strong but there was little grain in the heads, and could they help it if now [MASK] had sent such a year?
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Pansiao	Here by the time the letter reached [MASK] it was winter again, and the caves were chill and the water stood in drops on the rocks and would have frozen Aad there not been a fire burning in the middle of the cave on the rocky floor.
<name>God</name>	God	Heaven	She said with great thankfulness: “How can I refuse one into whose hand [MASK] has put me?” So without a word more he walked ahead of her toward his father’s house and she followed him, carrying her bundle of goods tied into a coarse blue cloth.
<name>Mrs. Grose</name>	Mrs. Grose	Jade	He showed her a back gate, and she went through it and so into the empty streets again. Now [MASK] had put the thought of poison into the cook’s mind as she might have cast a seed into the ground, though beyond it she herself had no clear thought.
<name>Mulan</name>	Mulan	Orchid	So when [MASK] heard how well her sister-in-law did, she thought to herself: “The city is at peace again and there is no reason why I cannot steal out the gate some morning and see what there is in the shops.
<name>Antonia</name>	Antonia	Mayli	“So when I came here,” [MASK] said, looking about the court, “I seemed to know what I saw. She had told me everything. The child was fond of me—how do I know why?
<name>Jing-mei</name>	Jing-mei	Mayli	[MASK] laughed too loudly for a Chinese girl. “That you are alone is only your own fault, father,” she said, and rose from her chair as she spoke. “Are there not at least three ladies who long to comfort you?”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Jade	All had been done and still the child would not be born, and [MASK]’s courage was beginning to fail. “This child is too big—she whispered, and in her own heart she began to doubt whether or not she could bring it to birth.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jade	But [MASK] was quick and she did know it. So she rose and opened her gate. “Oh,” she said, and then made haste to be more courteous. “I swear I am too loutish—but I am so—I did not expect you—” “
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	VII	“Does a cock still crow?” he thought and wondered that it could, and he sat on until the dawn broke and he saw the pale light fall upon his sons, sleeping in the ruins of his house. [MASK]
<name>Juliana</name>	Juliana	Jade	As for the cousin’s wife she went home and cursed her husband that her son had not wed [MASK] and that this was 206 not their grandchild and that their son had died and that they had no more children and that when they died they would be dead indeed with no son to live after them.
<name>daughter</name>	daughter	Jade	“Do I not love this earth?” he thought. “And is this earth not my 98 country? The young have left the land and gone to save themselves as my son and [MASK] have, but I love my country too well to leave it.
<name>Siddhartha</name>	Siddhartha	Pansiao	There were not seats for them and they sat on straw mats on the floor, such as Buddhist priests use to keep their knees from the dampness of the tiles when they pray. [MASK] looked at every face and saw no goddess, and that day it was hard to listen to her teacher.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Orchid	[MASK] smiled and went her way into the building and she came out the other door and behind a wall she went to the gate and she knew beforehand that this was a time when the gateman barred the gate and went inside his little house to eat his meal.
<name>Wakinyan</name>	Wakinyan	Heaven	In the kitchen of her home if the wind blew from the northwest as it often did in winter the smoke came back from the chimney. So it had done since the time of her ancestors, and knowing that [MASK] sent the winds they had always borne the smoke.
<name>Miss</name>	Miss	Pansiao	[MASK] put down her chopsticks and stared. Whispering rippled over the crowd of girls, “It is the new teacher—the new teacher.” They rose as they always did when the principal entered and remained standing until she sat down.
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Orchid	and she said: “I wish that poor [MASK] could see this, for she was so fat and yet when she had a child to nurse all she ate so heartily went to herself, and her big round breast that you would have said were full of milk were empty and only fat.”
<name>Ma Joad</name>	Ma Joad	Jade	Now there could scarcely have been a worse moment for them to come than the one they had chanced upon. For 328 early that morning [MASK]’s child had begun to come, and her labor had gone through the whole day and the child for some reason clung to the womb and would not come out.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Jade	“[MASK]!” he called the moment he came into their room. Sometimes she was there and oftener not. He seldom found her twice in the same place in the house or out of the house and never waiting for him in his bed.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Jade	“I do pot see why [MASK] should go off like this,” she said. “Who will look after her when her time comes and why should our grandchild be born somewhere out in a field like a wild hare?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jade	“But it is not thought good now,” [MASK] said bravely. “I bought a little book in that upper river city that told of how to care for children, and this it spoke against, that food should be put from one mouth to another.”
<name>he</name>	he	Jade	“I never saw a woman who is like a goddess,” she said. “There are none, doubtless,” [MASK] said, “but of we can find the one he thinks is one, it will do as well.”
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Pansiao	45 st tie your smallest son to your back and iree for once and you must prepare the food, u shall keep the fire going for her so that the -iot harm my grandson’s eyes, and as for [MASK] weave as she ever does, except that if your father Wi.
<name>Baba</name>	Baba	Jade	There the soldier shouted to the cook, “Here is an old woman with a basket full of something better than gold, and all I ask is a taste of the dish when it is done!” He laughed and went away, and there [MASK] was at the kitchen door.
<name>Miss Amelia</name>	Miss Amelia	Mayli	Before she was finished other girls came in and so [MASK] said, “I must hear this for my mother was born in that city. Come to my room, child, this evening, before you sleep.”
<name>Wangero</name>	Wangero	Mayli	“He has not learned only because he saw no good in it. Nobody reads or writes in our village except one old cousin, and he is a fool.” She examined [MASK]’s face anxiously. “If you wished him to learn he would learn.
<name>Marianne</name>	Marianne	Mayli	“Oh, I pray you—will you marry my brother?” Now of all the things which [MASK] might have heard from this young girl, here was the last she could have expected. She dropped her pretty lower jaw and stared at her.
<name>Milady</name>	Milady	Jade	This second son laid his schemes far and wide, and if in carrying them through he had to kill, he killed, but he thought of the end and not of the moment. And in this scheming no woman could have helped him more than [MASK] did.
<name>Sister</name>	Sister	Jade	He smiled a melancholy smile as he measured out the white powder. “There are many who buy this medicine these days,” he said, “and they are nearly all women.” “Do they buy it for themselves, too?” [MASK] asked to deceive him.
