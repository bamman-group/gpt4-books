<name>Juliette</name>	Juliette	Suzanne	[MASK] blushed again; she had lost count of time and of place whilst she had stood beside the fire, allowing the handsome young Englishman's eyes to dwell upon her sweet face, and his hand, as if unconsciously, to rest upon hers.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Marguerite	Buried in her thoughts, [MASK] had found this hour in the breezy summer night all too brief; and it was with a feeling of keen disappointment, that she suddenly realised that the bays had turned into the massive gates of her beautiful English home.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Marguerite	“Yes, yes, darling--indeed I am,” said [MASK] with an effort, forcing herself to smile. “I love to hear you talking . . . and your happiness makes me so very glad. . . . Have no fear, we will manage to propitiate maman.
<name>Biddy</name>	Biddy	Sally	“Now then, [MASK], me girl, now then!” he said, trying to force a frown upon his good-humoured face, “stop that fooling with them young jackanapes and get on with the work.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marguerite	“I wonder now . . .” Suddenly he paused, after a few moments of deadly silence, he gave forth a long, low, curious chuckle, while once again [MASK] felt, with a horrible shudder, his thin fingers wandering over her face.
<name>Lucasta</name>	Lucasta	Lud	“[MASK], then,” she said with affected merriment, “since 'tis one of your imaginary plots, you'd best go back to your own seat and leave me enjoy the music.” And with her hand she began to beat time nervously against the cushion of the box.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Percy	“I cannot say.” He was evidently trying to get away, whilst she was straining every nerve to keep him back for a moment or two. “[MASK],” she said, “will you not tell me why you go to-day?
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Grospierre	unless he be the devil himself. But [MASK] was a fool. The market carts were going through the gates; there was one laden with casks, and driven by an old man, with a boy beside him.
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Chauvelin	It all was so neat, so ingenious. [MASK] was still absolutely helpless, far more so than he could even have been under a blow from the fist, for now he could neither see, nor hear, nor speak, whilst his cunning adversary had quietly slipped through his fingers.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Odd	“[MASK]'s fish!” he rejoined quietly, “then certainly the game would have been up. I could but take the risk. I know human nature pretty well by now,” he added, with a note of sadness in his cheery, young voice, “and
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Marguerite	He had evidently been much startled when he heard who his lady visitor was, for he looked anxiously--even suspiciously--at [MASK], whilst performing the elaborate bows before her, which the rigid etiquette of the time demanded.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	But the keen brain, which had planned and carried through so many daring plots, was too far-seeing to take unnecessary risks. This place, after all, might be infested with spies; the innkeeper might be in [MASK]'s pay.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Madame	“Danger? I? . . . Nay, [MASK], your solicitude does me honour. As you say, I have some influence; my intention is to exert it before it be too late.” “Will you allow me to thank you at least?”
<name>Jean</name>	Jean	Brogard	When the table was set--such as it was--[MASK] surveyed it with evident satisfaction. He then dusted one of the chairs with the corner of his blouse, gave a stir to the stock-pot, threw a fresh bundle of faggots on to the fire, and slouched out of the room.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Percy	She did not know!-- She did not know whether [MASK] was even now, at this moment, in the hands of the soldiers of the Republic, enduring--as she had done herself--the gibes and jeers of his malicious enemy.
<name>Esmeralda</name>	Esmeralda	Marguerite	It was very obvious that he was exhausted from sheer physical pain, and when at last the rope gave way, he fell in a heap against the rock. [MASK] looked helplessly round her. “Oh! for a drop of water on this awful beach!”
<name>Thistle</name>	Thistle	Thistle	He said you would understand.” “At 'The Rose and [MASK]'? What was he doing?” “He was waiting for the coach, your ladyship, which he had ordered.” “The coach?” “Yes, my lady.
<name>Armande</name>	Armande	Marguerite	Nay! [MASK] herself could not have told that. Not at this moment at any rate; perhaps her pride had sealed her mind against a better understanding of her own heart. But this she did know--that she meant to capture that obstinate heart back again.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Marguerite	[MASK] uttered a little cry of astonishment, at thus hearing her own familiar maiden name uttered so close to her. She looked up at the stranger, and this time, with a cry of unfeigned pleasure, she put out both her hands effusively towards him.
<name>Varney</name>	Varney	Chauvelin	She could not see [MASK], but she could almost feel those keen, pale eyes of his fixed maliciously upon her helpless form, and his hurried, whispered words reached her ear, as the death-knell of her last faint, lingering hope.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	[MASK], with a muttered oath, which boded no good to her, who had dared to upset his most cherished plans, had hastily shouted the word of command,-- “Into it, my men, and let no one escape from that hut alive!”
<name>Merlin</name>	Merlin	Jutley	“Absolutely clear, citoyen.” “Very well, then. Go and see [MASK] at once. See the reinforcements start off for the patrol duty, then ask the captain to let you have a half-a-dozen more men and bring them here with you.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Marguerite	She stooped to pick it up. It was a solid gold ring, with a flat shield, on which was engraved a small device. [MASK] turned it over in her fingers, and then studied the engraving on the shield.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	“Now listen very attentively, all of you,” continued [MASK], impressively, and addressing the soldiers collectively, “for after this we may not be able to exchange another word, so remember every syllable I utter, as if your very lives depended on your memory.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	CHERIE	I may have to curtail our time together to-day. . . . I may have to go away--you'll understand?” “I understand that something has happened, [MASK], and that you want to be alone. I won't be a hindrance to you.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Reuben	Will your Excellency deign to look.” “I don't want to see it. How far can you drive me in it?” “As far as the Pere Blanchard's hut, your Honour, and further than [MASK]'s nag took your friend.
<name>Leatherstocking</name>	Leatherstocking	Marguerite	“Thanks, honest friend,” said [MASK], who was still smiling at the thought of what the worthy fellow must be thinking at that very moment, “we shall require nothing more; and here's for all the trouble you have been put to on our account.”
<name>Swann</name>	Swann	Percy	But those mute and ugly things seemed to say to her that they were waiting for [MASK]; that soon, very soon, he would be here, that the squalid room being still empty, they would be alone together.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	I knew that when I slipped through [MASK]'s fingers at the 'Chat Gris,' that he would lie in wait for me here, whichever way I took. I wanted to keep an eye on him and his doings, and a British head is as good as a French one any day.”
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Marguerite	[MASK]'s fresh young cheeks became a touch more pale and she bit her under lip, for she would not let him see that the shaft had struck home. “That is beside the question,” she said at last with indifference.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Marguerite	“We ought to weigh anchor before half an hour, your ladyship,” replied the old man, pulling at his grey forelock. Linking her arm in his, [MASK] led her brother towards the cliffs. “Half an hour,” she said, looking wistfully out to sea, “half an hour more
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Desgas	She had heard [MASK] giving orders to his men, and then starting off towards the fort, to get a reinforcement of a dozen more men: six were not thought sufficient to capture the cunning Englishman, whose resourceful brain was even more dangerous than his valour and his strength.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Marguerite	“Quite well, thank you,” he said at last, drily. There was a pause, during which [MASK] could watch these two antagonists who, evidently in their minds, were measuring themselves against one another.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Chauvelin	“Pick that up,” said [MASK] to the sergeant, pointing to this white scrap, “and bring it to me.” It was a crumpled piece of paper, evidently forgotten there by the fugitives, in their hurry to get away.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Armand	But [MASK] must be saved at any cost; he, first of all, for he was her brother, had been mother, father, friend to her ever since she, a tiny babe, had lost both her parents.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Marguerite	[MASK] knew him well enough to guess what was passing in his mind. He had no fear for his own person, although he certainly was alone in a lonely inn with a man who was powerfully built, and who was daring and reckless beyond the bounds of probability.
<name>Blakeney</name>	Blakeney	Madame	“You desired my presence, [MASK],” he said frigidly. “I take it that it was not with the view to indulging in tender reminiscences.” His voice certainly was cold and uncompromising: his attitude before her, stiff and unbending. Womanly decorum would have suggested
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marguerite	[MASK], with dainty affection, had kissed her hand to the ladies, as they disappeared through the door, then a humorous smile began hovering round the corners of her mouth. “So that's it, is it?” she said gaily.
<name>he</name>	he	Jellyband	“Everything, thanks, honest friend, and as I am famished and dead with fatigue, I pray you see to the rooms.” “Now tell me,” she said eagerly, as soon as [MASK] had gone from the room, “tell me all your news.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Louise	“Does your ladyship wish for anything else?” she asked, when that was done. “No, nothing more. Put out the lights as you go out.” “Yes, my lady. Good-night, my lady.” “Good-night, [MASK].”
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Armand	In a moment she had guessed the danger. Papers? . . . Had [MASK] been imprudent? . . . The very thought struck her with nameless terror. Still she would not let this man see that she feared; she laughed gaily and lightly. “Faith!
<name>Marguerite</name>	Marguerite	Madame	His whole attitude was one of intense longing--a veritable prayer for that confidence, which her foolish pride withheld from him. When she remained silent he sighed, and said with marked coldness-- “Faith, [MASK], since it distresses you, we will not speak of it. . . .
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Marguerite	For the moment [MASK]'s sweet face had become as white as the soft fichu which swathed her throat, and a very keen observer might have noted that the hand which held the tall, beribboned stick was clenched, and trembled somewhat.
<name>James</name>	James	Sally	But my coachman and men will stay the night, and probably several days longer, so I hope you will make them comfortable.” “Yes, my lady; I'll look after them. Shall [MASK] bring your ladyship some supper?” “Yes, please.
<name>Yasha</name>	Yasha	Chauvelin	er . . . Begad!--a friend of mine died once . . . er . . . choked . . . just like you . . . with a spoonful of soup.” And he smiled shyly, good-humouredly, down at [MASK].
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	One or two of the men, who had run after the fugitives, were now slowly working their way up the cliff: one of them reached [MASK]'s side, at the very moment that this hope arose in the astute diplomatist's heart.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Chauvelin	she might have asked him, had she thought of it! Anyway, she had no fears that the unknown and brave hero would fall in [MASK]'s trap; his death at any rate would not be at her door.
<name>possible</name>	possible	HEAVENLY	I had never loved any one before, as you know, and I was four-and-twenty then--so I naturally thought that it was not in my nature to love. But it has always seemed to me that it MUST be [MASK] to be loved blindly, passionately, wholly . . .
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lucile	“And you, child, run within. Tell [MASK] to get ready. I fear that I must send you home, child. And--stay, tell one of the maids to prepare a travelling dress and cloak for me.”
<name>Althea</name>	Althea	Marguerite	Could it be that with the waning of her husband's love, [MASK]'s heart had awakened with love for him? Strange extremes meet in love's pathway: this woman, who had had half intellectual Europe at her feet, might perhaps have set her affections on a fool.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	[MASK] had sworn to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine, and now the daring plotter, whose anonymity hitherto had been his safeguard, stood revealed through her own hand, to his most bitter, most relentless enemy.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Chauvelin	There had been a long pause, during which, no doubt, [MASK] satisfied the men as to his identity, for presently, questions and answers followed each other in quick succession. “You have seen the stranger?”
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Madame	“Nay, [MASK], it is no mask,” he said icily; “I swore to you . . . once, that my life was yours. For months now it has been your plaything . . . it has served its purpose.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Tony	As for me, sir, I never fight duels,” he added, as he placidly sat down and stretched his long, lazy legs out before him. “Demmed uncomfortable things, duels, ain't they, [MASK]?”
<name>Chichikov</name>	Chichikov	Chauvelin	When the Jew was again on his feet, [MASK] said,-- “How soon can your horse and cart be ready?” “They are ready now, your Honour.” “Where?” “Not ten metres from this door. Will your Excellency deign to look.”
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Pride	She stood looking at him for a moment or two longer. He was again as rigid, as impassive, as before. [MASK] had conquered, and he cared naught for her. The grey light of dawn was gradually yielding to the rosy light of the rising sun.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Marguerite	[MASK] shuddered. She felt that from this man she could expect no mercy. All-powerful, he held the beloved life in the hollow of his hand. She knew him too well not to know that, if he failed in gaining his own ends, he would be pitiless.
<name>Wagner</name>	Wagner	Cupid	Well, well! I do believe it was [MASK] himself who stood by you, and threatened the entire Foreign Office with destruction by fire, just on purpose to make me drop love's message, before it had been polluted by my indiscreet eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marguerite	The voice drew nearer; for one brief second the wild desire seized [MASK] to rush down the steps and fly across the room, to stop that song at any cost, to beg the cheerful singer to fly--fly for his life, before it be too late.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Marguerite	[MASK] suddenly felt intense sympathy for her husband. The moral crisis she had just gone through made her feel indulgent towards the faults, the delinquencies, of others. How thoroughly a human being can be buffeted and overmastered by Fate, had been borne in upon her with appalling force.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Percy	Then he bent forward and looked long and searchingly into his wife's blue eyes. “[MASK],” she whispered, while a deep blush suffused her delicate cheeks and neck, “if you only knew . . .” “I do know, dear . . .
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Tony	You have no idea, [MASK]. . . .” “No! I haven't,” interrupted his friend pleasantly, “but I'll take your word for it. And now,” he added, whilst a sudden earnestness crept over his jovial young face, “how about business?”
<name>Challenger</name>	Challenger	Marguerite	“I pray you,” said [MASK], “keep the creature in a good temper, so that he may answer the questions we must put to him.” “I'll do my best, but, begad! I'd sooner scrag him than question him.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	“Bring the cowardly brute here,” commanded [MASK]. He certainly felt exceedingly vicious, and since he had no reasonable grounds for venting his ill-humour on the soldiers who had but too punctually obeyed his orders, he felt that the son of the despised race would prove an excellent butt.
<name>Marguerite</name>	Marguerite	Marguerite	she exclaimed. “Himself, citoyenne, at your service,” said the stranger, gallantly kissing the tips of her fingers. [MASK] said nothing for a moment or two, as she surveyed with obvious delight the not very prepossessing little figure before her.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	[MASK] stood beside her, his shrewd, pale, yellow eyes fixed on the pretty face, which looked so sweet and childlike in this soft English summer twilight. “You surprise me, citoyenne,” he said quietly, as he took a pinch of snuff.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Odd	She had no knife, her fingers were numb and weak, but she worked away with her teeth, while great welcome tears poured from her eyes, onto those poor, pinioned hands. “[MASK]'s life!”
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	She had betrayed him to his enemy--unwittingly 'tis true--but she HAD betrayed him, and if [MASK] succeeded in trapping him, who so far was unaware of his danger, then his death would be at her door. His death!
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Marguerite	The bold singer, too, had become silent, warned, no doubt, of his impending danger by [MASK]'s frantic shrieks. The men had sprung to their feet, there was no need for further silence on their part; the very cliffs echoed the poor, heart-broken woman's screams.
<name>Sally</name>	Sally	Sally	And a chorus of pewter mugs, tapped with impatient hands against the oak tables of the coffee-room, accompanied the shouts for mine host's buxom daughter. “[MASK]!” shouted a more persistent voice, “are ye goin' to be all night with that there beer?”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Marguerite	“Oh, lud!” said [MASK], as she advanced into the room, holding her handkerchief to her dainty nose, “what a dreadful hole! Are you sure this is the place?” “Aye! '
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Desgas	“Will your horse and cart be safe alone, here, do you think?” he asked roughly. “I fancy, citoyen,” here interposed [MASK], “that they will be safer without that dirty, cowardly Jew than with him.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Percy	She could see [MASK] almost full face where he sat at the table not ten yards from where she herself was crouching, puzzled, not knowing what to do, or what she should think. She had quite controlled her impulse now of rushing down and disclosing herself to her husband.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	Now she blamed herself terribly for not having gone down to him sooner, and given him that word of warning and of love which, perhaps, after all, he needed. He could not know of the orders which [MASK] had given for his capture, and even now, perhaps . . .
<name>Lucilla</name>	Lucilla	Marguerite	[MASK] did not feel equal to another dance; there is a limit to the most enduring of self-control. Escorted by a Cabinet Minister, she had once more found her way to the tiny boudoir, still the most deserted among all the rooms.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Lud	“[MASK]! they alter a man so . . . but . . . begad! I hope you don't mind my having made the remark? . . . Demmed bad form making remarks. . . . I hope you don't mind?”
<name>Clayton</name>	Clayton	Chauvelin	We waited.” “I heard the men creep out of the hut, not many minutes after we took cover, and long before the woman screamed,” he added, as [MASK] seemed still quite speechless with rage.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marguerite	“They told me you were in the garden,” she went on prattling merrily, and throwing herself with a pretty, girlish impulse into [MASK]'s arms, “so I ran out to give you a surprise. You did not expect me quite
<name>Jacques</name>	Jacques	Reuben	“He took the words out of my mouth, your Excellency: when I was about to offer the wealthy Englishman my horse and cart, to take him wheresoever he chose, [MASK] had already spoken, and offered his half-starved nag, and his broken-down cart.”
<name>Blakeney</name>	Blakeney	Odd	“[MASK]'s life! but I wish those demmed fellows had not hit quite so hard!” This time it was quite unmistakable, only one particular pair of essentially British lips could have uttered those words, in sleepy, drawly, affected tones.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	she feared--now with a deadly fear that [MASK] HAD failed, and that the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel had proved elusive once more; then she knew that she need hope for no pity, no mercy, from him. He had pronounced his “Either--or--” and nothing less would content him:
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Chauvelin	But [MASK] was not the man to trouble himself about these social amenities, which he called mere incidents in his diplomatic career. He was blindly enthusiastic for the revolutionary cause, he despised all social inequalities, and he had a burning love for his own country:
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	[MASK] was evidently devoured with impatience. Apparently he trusted no one: this last trick played upon him by the daring Scarlet Pimpernel had made him suddenly doubtful of success, unless he himself was there to watch, direct and superintend the capture of this impudent Englishman.
<name>He</name>	He	Brogard	Good luck to you, friend! Have no fear for me.” Lightly she mounted the rickety wooden steps that led to the attic. [MASK] was taking no further heed of her. She could make herself comfortable there or not as she chose.
<name>Margot</name>	Margot	Percy	“But surely . . .” “There, there, dear, don't distress yourself on my account. [MASK] is very good . . .” “Nay!” he interrupted energetically, “I will distress myself on your account, my Margot.
<name>Percy</name>	Percy	Armand	For a moment her thoughts wandered away from the loved one who was in danger, to that other man who also had a claim on her confidence and her affection. She felt lonely, frightened for [MASK]'s sake; she longed to seek comfort and advice from someone who would know how to help and console.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	Do you understand?” “We understand, citoyen.” “The man who is tall above the average is probably also strong above the average; it will take four or five of you at least to overpower him.” There was a little pause, then [MASK] continued,--
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Desgas	[MASK] turned a little pale. There was so much rage and hatred in his superior's whole attitude. “The tall stranger, citoyen--” he stammered. “Was here, in this room, five minutes ago, having supper at that table. Damn his impudence!
<name>Marguerite</name>	Marguerite	Margot	“You might have saved me, [MASK]!” he seemed to say to her, “and you chose the life of a stranger, a man you do not know, whom you have never seen, and preferred that he should be safe, whilst you sent me to the guillotine!”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chauvelin	Suddenly, as she watched [MASK], a sound caught her ear, which turned her very heart to stone. And yet that sound was not calculated to inspire anyone with horror, for it was merely the cheerful sound of a gay, fresh voice singing lustily, “God save the King!”
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Armand	Oh, [MASK]! will you ever know the terrible sacrifice of pride, of dignity, of womanliness a devoted sister is making for your sake? “Nothing of importance,” she said, staring mechanically before her, “but it might prove a clue.
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Chauvelin	“One was, 'I start myself to-morrow,'” she said quietly, “the other--'If you wish to speak to me, I shall be in the supper-room at one o'clock precisely.'” [MASK] looked up at the clock just above the mantelpiece.
<name>Marguerite</name>	Marguerite	Marguerite	The whole of this sordid abode was dimly lighted by an evil-smelling oil-lamp, which hung from the rickety rafters of the ceiling. It all looked so horribly squalid, so dirty and uninviting, that [MASK] hardly dared to cross the threshold.
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Chauvelin	For the moment she could do nothing but follow the soldiers and [MASK]. She feared to lose her way, or she would have rushed forward and found that wooden hut, and perhaps been in time to warn the fugitives and their brave deliverer yet.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Chauvelin	what was that?” All three men listened attentively. In the far, very far distance, could be heard faintly echoing and already dying away, the quick, sharp splash of half a dozen oars. [MASK] took out his handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his forehead.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Chauvelin	“Have you ever heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel, Citoyenne St. Just?” asked [MASK], abruptly. “Heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel?” she retorted with a long and merry laugh, “Faith man! we talk of nothing else. . . .
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Chauvelin	With a final, most abject and cringing bow, the old Jew shuffled out of the room. [MASK] seemed pleased with his interview, for he rubbed his hands together, with that usual gesture of his, of malignant satisfaction.
<name>She</name>	She	Marguerite	At dawn I will send an escort for you; until then, I feel sure that you will find him devoted, though perhaps a trifle slow.” [MASK] only had the strength to turn her head away. Her heart was broken with cruel anguish.
<name>Blakeney</name>	Blakeney	m'dear	“But how?” she gasped, “I do not understand.” “Yet, 'tis simple enough, [MASK],” he said with that funny, half-shy, half-inane laugh of his, “you see!
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Desgas	quick!--did any of you see him?” “Where, citoyen?” asked [MASK], in surprise. “Here, man! through that door! not five minutes ago.” “We saw nothing, citoyen! The moon is not yet up, and . . .”
