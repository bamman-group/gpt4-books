<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ryle	[MASK] walks over and reaches for my hand to help me up. I don’t know how I’m supposed to last until my due date when I can’t even get out of a chair without grunting. Once I’m standing, he doesn’t immediately release my hand.
<name>the TV</name>	the TV	Allysa	My mother’s hand falls down on my shoulder and she leans in and kisses me on the cheek. “I have to go,” she says. “Open house tonight.” I tell her goodbye and watch her walk outside, then turn my attention back to [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Lily	I walk over to him and take his hand. I place it on my stomach and hold it there. He smiles at me, brushing his thumb back and forth. It’s a beautiful moment. One of our better moments. “Thank you, [MASK].”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ryle	I’m not sure I’m in the mood to explain how we already know each other. [MASK] touches my ankle and inspects it. “Can you move it?” I try to move it, but a sharp pain shoots all the way up my leg.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Ryle	“He is such an idiot,” she says with a laugh. “He wrote the address to our floral shop on the back.” She takes the card out of my hands. Wow. [MASK] just bought me flowers. Not just any flower.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Allysa	but she’s wearing white capris. A disaster waiting to happen in this dust bowl. “Can I help you?” She tucks her purse beneath her arm and walks toward me, holding out her hand. “I’m [MASK],” she says.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Atlas	[MASK] steps inside the bathroom with me and locks the door. His back rests against the door as he stares at me, focused on the cut near my eye. “What happened?” he asks. I shake my head. “Nothing.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ryle	I have to stop comparing us to them. We’re our own individuals in an entirely different situation. My father never had an excuse for his anger, nor was he immediately apolo- getic. The way he treated my mother was much worse than what’s happened between [MASK] and me.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ryle	I didn’t think she liked me, either, but yesterday she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. I think she’s just hoping for free flowers, though. She’s very opportunistic.” [MASK] laughs and leans against the refrigerator.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Ryle	She still means a lot to me! ” I put the newspaper on the counter. “I don’t want to read anymore.” My voice cracks on its way up my throat. [MASK] takes two swift steps forward and grabs the newspaper.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Atlas	The waiter leans around [MASK] and says. “The chef. The owner. Sometimes waiter, sometimes dishwasher. He gives a new meaning to hands-on.” The next five seconds go unnoticed by everyone at our table, but they play out in slow motion to me.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Rylee	Come see us tomorrow when you get home from work. She sent a picture of her and [MASK], and it makes me smile. Then cry. Damn these emotions. I wait until my eyes are dry again before I walk into the living room.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Lily	She sighs heavily, and then, “[MASK]! What in the hell is going on? Oh my God, you can’t do this to me, I’m pregnant!” I start my car and set the phone to Bluetooth while I drive toward the store.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allysa	“Oh, God,” I say, looking at the options. “This is my new favorite restaurant,” [MASK] says. We pick out three desserts for the table. The four of us spend the time waiting for it to be served discussing baby names.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Ryle	I squeeze [MASK]’s hand with every push. At one point, I think about how important the hand I’m squeezing is to his career, but he says nothing. He just allows me to squeeze it as hard as I possibly can, and that’s exactly what I do.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allysa	“You have to believe that. [MASK] wanted me to tell you all of this because since that happened, there are things I can’t control. I get angry. I black out. I’ve been in therapy since I was six years old.
<name>Butterfly</name>	Butterfly	Lily	He presses a gentle kiss there and it feels just like the first time he kissed me there all those years ago. He brings his mouth to my ear, and in a whisper, he says, “You can stop swimming now, [MASK].
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Ryle	I’m able to hop all the way to the table with a lot of assistance from [MASK]. He helps me pull myself up until I’m seated on top of it, leaning against the wall with my leg stretched out in front of me.
<name>He</name>	He	Ryle	I’m supposed to hate him. I’m supposed to be the woman my mother was never strong enough to be. But if I’m emulating my mother’s behavior, then that would mean [MASK] is emulating my father’s behavior. But he isn’t.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ryle	Not asleep.” About ten seconds later, I get another text. [MASK]: Good. I’m walking up your stairs right now. Be there in twenty seconds. I grin and jump out of bed. I go to the bathroom and check my face.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allysa	I almost feel a little relieved that she reads me so well. I walk to her bed and take a seat on it. “[MASK],” I whisper. “Sit down.” I know this is going to hurt her almost as much as it hurt me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allysa	I watch him as he bends over the card and writes on both sides. I know I don’t have a right, but I’m brimming with jealousy. “Are you bringing this girl to my birthday party Friday?” [MASK] asks him.
<name>Prim</name>	Prim	Ryle	I nod and somehow mutter, “Thank you.” When I hear the front door close, I turn back and face the crib. My eyes fill with tears, and not for myself this time. Not for the baby. I cry for [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lily	I wish you all the success in the world.” He doesn’t respond to my goodbye. He silently stares down at me with somewhat of a frown, and then says, “Yeah. You too, [MASK].” Then he rolls away from me and stands up.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ryle	It bothers me that she doesn’t seem excited about the prospect of me dating [MASK]. It makes me wonder if that has more to do with her feelings toward me or her feelings toward him. Twenty minutes later, I flip the sign to closed.
<name>She</name>	She	Allysa	“Well, as your brother, I would hope you had a little more faith in me than you do. That’s what siblings do.” He walks out of the kitchen, shoving the door open. When he’s gone, [MASK] takes a deep breath.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allysa	She points to my phone. “Text me when you get home. And call me if you need anything. I won’t count favors as work-time.” “Thank you, [MASK].” She smiles. “No, thank you.
<name>Stargirl</name>	Stargirl	Ellen	The doors opened on the bus and he let me walk on first. I didn’t say You’re welcome because I was kind of shocked by my reaction. His voice gave me chills, [MASK]. Has a boy’s voice ever done that to you?
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Ryle	His body comes down against mine and he takes my wrists with one hand above my head, pressing them against the mattress. “[MASK], please.” I’m sobbing, trying to push him off of me with any part of my body. “Get off me.
<name>Hayden</name>	Hayden	Brad	He glances over at me and winks, and I drown in guilt for the way that wink makes me feel. Especially at a time like this. Why is my heart doing this to me? “Aw, that’s sweet,” [MASK] says.
<name>he</name>	he	Ryle	I’m not sure [MASK] or my mother even notice, though, because she’s having no issue firing question after question at him. He takes it like a champ. He’s very charming with my mother in all the right ways.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Allysa	“You guys deliver?” “[MASK] and I don’t,” I reply. “We have a delivery driver on standby. We weren’t sure if we’d actually need him today.” “Are you actually buying these for a girl?”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Devin	She twirls her way out of the kitchen, giggling the whole time. “I really like her,” [MASK] says. “She’s great, huh?” He leans against the island and says, “So.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Marshall	She was just telling me a few days ago how depressed she is that she can’t get pregnant. “I can’t have beer, [MASK].” “Then drink wine, at least. You like me more when you’re tipsy.”
<name>Emery</name>	Emery	Emmy	“Almost there, [MASK].” We make a right around the corner and I’m in such a rush, a man has to step out of our way and into the wall just to avoid being plowed over. “Sorry,” 1 mutter, ducking my head and making my way around him.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Katie	When we’re together everything else just seems to fade away, so I don’t think he even thought about other people noticing. But [MASK] noticed. She was sitting in the seat behind us and I heard her say, “Gross,” as soon as he leaned over and kissed me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ellen	She just held her head in her hands and she started to sob and all I could do was wrap my arms around her and cry with her. I’d never seen her this upset. Or this hurt. Or this scared. It broke my heart, [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lily	You know. Just trying to make it stop." He smirks and then downs the rest of his wine. “How thoughtful of you, [MASK].” He tosses his empty wineglass toward a trash can in the corner of the room.
<name>He</name>	He	Atlas	I fish around in my purse for the keys and don’t even realize my hands are shaking until my third failed attempt to open the door. [MASK] calmly takes the keys from me and I step aside as he opens the door for me.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Atlas	[MASK] was already in my room when they got home. I could hear them fighting as soon as they walked through the front door. A lot of the conversation was muffled, but for the most part, it sounded like my father was accusing her of flirting with some man.
<name>They</name>	They	Andyou	“[MASK] weren’t even trying.” He leaned forward and kissed that spot between my shoulder and my neck that he always kisses. I liked that he did it again. I don’t like much about my body, but that spot on my collarbone has become my favorite part of me.
<name>He</name>	He	Ryle	I part my hair to the side to cover up most of the bandage [MASK] had placed over my eye. The only thing visible from last night is the cut on my lip. And the hickey he gave me on my neck. Fucking irony at its best.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Ryle	I’m not sure I’ve ever laughed as hard as I have tonight. When the game is over, we all walk back to the shop to retrieve our cars. [MASK] said he caught an Uber over earlier, so he’ll just ride with me.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Ryle	You can still protect me. When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away. We’ll leave the situation until you’re calm enough to talk about it, okay? You are not a monster, [MASK]. You’re only human.
<name>Ainsley</name>	Ainsley	Lily	He leans against my car and folds his arms over his chest. There’s a long stretch of silence while I wait for what he has to say. His head is down, but he lifts it slightly, looking up at me. “Naked truths, [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Emerson	“It’s perfect, actually.” He leans down and kisses [MASK] on her forehead. After a while, I pull away from his shoulder so I can watch him hold her. It’s a beautiful thing, seeing him interact with her like this.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Atlas	I was hysterical. Hysterical. Not only did they have to take [MASK] away in an ambulance, they also had to call an ambulance for me because I couldn’t breathe. It was the first and only panic attack I’ve ever had.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Ryle	His words are full of panic. He’s kissing me, his lips gentle against my cheek and mouth. He knows what he’s done. He’s [MASK] again, and he knows what he’s just done to me. To us. To our future.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Ellen	I asked. He shook his head. “No. Me and you." I gasped, [MASK]. I hope he didn’t notice, but I definitely sucked in a rush of air. Because what the heck was I supposed to say to that?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Atlas	Me: Where are you? There are two men at your front door and I have no idea if I should let them in. I wait through more presses of the doorbell and more pounding, but [MASK] doesn’t immediately text me back.
<name>Belinda</name>	Belinda	Ellen	If he doesn’t have electricity, that means he doesn’t have a heater. I hope he at least has blankets. Do you know how awful I would feel if he froze to death? Pretty freaking awful, [MASK]. I’ll find some blankets this week and give them to him.
<name>Christian</name>	Christian	Ryle	“I’m cooking you dinner. And I’m wearing an apron.” “Oh yeah?” he says. “Just an apron.” And then I hang up. A few seconds later, I get a text message. [MASK]: Pic, please.
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Lily	“[MASK],” he whispers, still holding me tightly. “I know this is the last thing you need to hear right now. But I have to say it because I’ve walked away from you too many times without saying what I really want to say.”
<name>He</name>	He	Atlas	I’m an adult with responsibilities and a child. I can’t just allow my teenage feelings to take over. Not without a little reassurance, at least. I pull back and look up at him. “Do you donate to charity?” [MASK] laughs with confusion.
<name>He</name>	He	Atlas	“I think I need to call it a night,” I say quietly, pulling away from him. I stand up and [MASK] stands up, too. “I’ll be gone most of the day tomorrow,” he says.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Atlas	But sometimes, especially tonight, I wish you did. I just need someone to talk to about everything I’m feeling. It’s been six months since I’ve seen [MASK] and I honestly don’t know where he is or how he’s doing.
<name>Aaron</name>	Aaron	Ryle	scared. I hear the front door open and slam shut again. [MASK] appears in the doorway and I have no idea if I’m supposed to hate him. Or be terrified of him. Or feel bad for him. How can I be feeling all three?
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Allysa	After about half an hour, a booth on the top floor opens up and we all run upstairs to claim it. “Much better,” [MASK] says as we slide in. It’s much quieter up here, although still loud compared to normal standards.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Atlas	I had given [MASK] a change of clothes, and knew he not only needed to be out of the house when my parents got home, but he needed to be far away from our house. I’m sure my father would recognize his own clothes on some random teenager in the neighborhood.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ryle	“If [MASK] truly loves you, he wouldn’t allow you to take him back.” That reminder is the only thing that prevents me from running down the hallway. I keep myself busy in the kitchen for the next hour as he remains in the nursery.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ryle	The name of it. What he said in the interview. Then, of course, those thoughts lead me back to thoughts of [MASK] and the anger in his voice as he yelled the last line of the interview at me.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Atlas	They’re raisins, man, open the door!” Before I open the door and let them know [MASK] isn’t home, I text him, hoping he’s about to pull in the driveway and deal with this himself. Me: Where are you?
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Allysa	“Sweet, life, pink, spring,” I repeat. And then, “[MASK], you’re brilliant!” I stand up and begin pacing the floor. “We’ll take everything everyone loves about flowers, and we’ll do the complete opposite!”
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Ryle	I have no idea where my dress ended up last night, so I pulled on one of [MASK]’s shirts. It falls past my knees, and I wonder if he has to buy shirts that are too big for him just so they’ll fit his arms.
<name>Kevin</name>	Kevin	Atlas	and we still haven’t talked about that night. By the time the police got to my bedroom and pulled my father off of him, I didn’t even recognize [MASK], he was covered in so much blood. I was hysterical. Hysterical.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Atlas	What kind of average person knows how to shuffle cards like that?” I smile and begin to pass cards out to each of them. “I guess we’ll have to play a round to find out.” We’re on our third round of bets when [MASK] finally walks in.
<name>Ana</name>	Ana	Lily	He grimaces and pushes the keys to my apartment toward me. “Go back home, [MASK]. I won’t be there. I promise.” He turns and begins walking toward the door. It occurs to me that he didn’t even try to apologize.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Ryle	I laugh at her constant repetition. [MASK] squeezes my hand and says, “Sounds like business was good.” I shrug. “I can’t complain. I mean . . . I’m no brain surgeon, but I’m pretty good at what I do.”
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Ryle	“I don’t feel sexy right now, [MASK]. I worked all day, I’m exhausted, I smell like sweat and probably taste like dust. If you give me a little while to shower first, I might feel sexy enough to have sex with you.”
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Allysa	“Around four months,” [MASK] says with a yawn. She drops her fork and leans back in her chair, rubbing her eyes. “You want me to keep her at my place tonight so you guys can get a full night of sleep?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lily	“Is that ... is this your baby?” I nod and he walks around to the front of the stroller. He kneels down and smiles widely at her. “Wow. She’s gorgeous, [MASK],” he says. “What’s her name?”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Darin	“What the hell is wrong with you?” he yells at [MASK]. I reach over and squeeze his arm reassuringly. “Relax,” I say. “We bonded before you got here. I actually don’t mind that they’re making light of my situation.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Atlas	Tears fill my eyes and I see [MASK] roll across the wall, pressing his forehead against it. The nurse waits until I make eye contact with her again to continue speaking. “We have a certain examination for these situations. It’s called a SANE exam.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Atlas	And I know this is my only chance to get out what I have to say before he’s out of my life forever. “[MASK], wait.” I stand up so fast, my chair scoots across the room and bumps against the wall.
<name>Dr. Ramirez</name>	Dr. Ramirez	Ryle	“You okay?” I nod and force a smile, then clear my throat. “Yep. We were just talking about you,” I say, glancing back at my mother. “[MASK] assisted in an eighteen-hour surgery this week.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lily	She can see the worry on my face, so she grabs my hands in both of hers. “He’s good, [MASK]. He’s so good. I promise.” Relief washes over me in an instant, because I can see she’s telling the truth.
<name>J.D.</name>	J.D.	Ellen	I was looking at your name just now and it made me think of that. [MASK]. Is that even your real name? You could be just like my great-grandfather and using your initials as a disguise.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ryle	She threw me a baby shower today. My mother came. [MASK]’s mother even flew in for it, but she’s in the guest room sleeping off her jet lag now. The girls from the floral shop came and a few friends from my old job.
<name>Dad</name>	Dad	Atlas	My dad keeps his car in the garage and my mom keeps her car in the driveway. Well, yesterday my mom got home a little bit early. [MASK] was still at the house and we were almost finished watching your show when I heard the garage door start to open.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Ryle	No one suspects a thing when you have on a baggy sweater and a jacket. I know I need to tell someone soon, but I feel like [MASK] should be the first one I tell, and I don’t want to do that over a long-distance phone conversation.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allysa	He finally reaches a break in the crowd and makes eye contact with me again. He holds my gaze as he marches toward me. He doesn’t slow down. [MASK] has to step out of his way as he walks straight up to me.
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Bloom	“My last name ... is [MASK].” He’s quiet. I can feel him trying to hold back his pity. “I know. It’s awful. It’s the name of a two-year-old little girl, not a twenty-three-year-old woman.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Ryle	Right before we make it to the door, [MASK] rushes back to the counter and grabs the newspaper and tucks it under his arm. My hands are shaking with excitement as I lock the door. “We’re gonna be aunts!”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Ryle	“I’m fine, [MASK]. The doctor said light bed rest, not complete debilitation.” He starts to open the door, but pauses like he forgets something. He runs back toward me and leans down, planting his lips on my stomach.
<name>Katniss</name>	Katniss	Lily	I watch his reaction closely. He just shakes his head and without looking up he says, “No. Are you going, [MASK]?” I can’t tell by his voice alone if he’s hoping I’ll be there or hoping I won’t.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Allysa	I make silly faces at her to make her smile more. There have been so many times I’ve wanted to tell [MASK] about the pregnancy, but it makes it hard when the secret I’m keeping is being kept from her own brother.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Atlas	“Leave him.” Leave him? Jesus, he thinks this is something else entirely. I take a step forward and shake my head. “He’s not like that, [MASK]. It wasn’t like that.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lily	He would make the decision to leave you himself so that he knows for a fact he can never hurt you again. That’s the kind of love a woman deserves, [MASK].” I wish with all my heart that she didn’t learn these things from experience.
<name>him</name>	him	Atlas	Today I’m asking myself how it could possibly get any worse. I jump back with the sudden knock at the door. It’s only been ten seconds since he walked out, so I know it’s [MASK]. I unlock it and open it
<name>James</name>	James	Ryle	Actually, it’s ludicrous and deceptive. I think I might be really angry at him right now. [MASK] laughs and pushes off the doorframe. Now he’s filling up the entire doorway as he lifts his hands to the frame over his head and grips it.
<name>Jackson</name>	Jackson	Devin	[MASK] pops his jaw and says, “Consider it done.” He puts his hand on my lower back as he walks me out of the elevator. There’s only one visible door in the hallway, so we make our way over and ring the doorbell.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Ryle	Maybe it’s the wine. I don’t know, but I love today. Everything about it. I especially love how [MASK] looks, leaning against my car, watching me. “You’re really beautiful when you’re happy.” Ugh! This day!
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Ryle	OH! GO!” I hang up right when the first sign of pain shoots through my stomach. I wince and start dialing [MASK]’s number. He picks up on the first ring. “Do I need to turn around?” “Yes.”
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Ryle	There wasn’t one great thing I could say about that man—so I just stared silently at the crowd until my mother realized what I was doing and had my uncle remove me from the podium.” [MASK] tilts his head. “Are you kidding me?
<name>Hazel</name>	Hazel	Lily	I just start crying and crying and shaking and crying. “[MASK],” he whispers. I’ve never heard my name spoken so sadly. He urges me to look up at him. His blue eyes scroll over my face, and I see it happen.
<name>Jenny</name>	Jenny	Allysa	[MASK] laughs. “I swear, every time I talk to him, he’s lost. He can’t figure out whether to take the A-line or the B-line.” “Yeah,” I tell her. “He figured it out.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Ruined	[MASK]. I get dizzy all of a sudden from standing up too fast after having three glasses of wine. I grab the counter beside him to steady myself, just as he reaches in to pull the burnt casserole out.
<name>Back</name>	Back	Ellen	He spent the whole time we were in the grocery store telling me about how people take advantage of the government and until the government stops helping those people by giving them handouts, the problem won’t ever go away. [MASK], I believed him.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Ellen	[MASK]. I just. . . He was on top of her. They were on the couch and he had his hand around her throat, but his other hand was pulling up her dress. She was trying to fight him off and I just stood there, frozen.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lily	She was crying and I could already see the redness on her cheek from where he hit her. When I walked closer to her, wanting to make sure she was okay, she turned her back to me and gripped the counter. “I said I’m fine, [MASK].
