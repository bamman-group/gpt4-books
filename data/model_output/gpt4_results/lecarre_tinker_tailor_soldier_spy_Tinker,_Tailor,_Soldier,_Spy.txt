<name>Marlene</name>	Marlene	Ann	“And what did he say about me?” He repeated: “What did he say about me?” “Showed me a cigarette lighter. Said it was yours. Present from [MASK]. ‘With all my love.’ Her signature. Engraved.”
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Smiley	[MASK] shrugged it all aside, distrustful as ever of the standard shapes of human motive. He settled instead for a picture of one of those wooden Russian dolls that open up, revealing one person inside the other, and another inside him.
<name>Reggie</name>	Reggie	Mendel	“I got those happy snaps from the chemist, by the by,” said [MASK] finally, when he had checked it all back. “Come out a treat. Not a miss among them.” “Thanks. I’m gladi”
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Tarr	To everyone’s astonishment, [MASK] was once again blushing. “She liked to visit there. Not for services, just to sniff around. I hung around the entrance looking natural but she didn’t show. It was the first time she’d broken a date.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tarr	In this dead letter-box, [MASK] said, he found not a letter but a whole damn diary. The writing was fine and done on both sides of the paper, so that quite often the black ink came through. It was fast urgent writing with no erasures.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Roach	But [MASK] had run out of words. He had no memory any more, no sense of size or perspective; his faculty of selection in the adult world had gone. Big men, small men, old, young, crooked, straight—they were a single army of indistinguishable dangers.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Stokovsky	No overt connection with the local residency, no involvement in bread-and-butter operations, no coat-trailing, no talent-spotting—a good solid cover job. Still there, for all I know.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	George	[MASK],” she murmured, watching him proudly across the room as he took the sherry bottle from his briefcase and filled two glasses. “Of all the lovely darling men I ever knew. He walked,” she explained to the spaniel. “Look at his boots.
<name>Orwell</name>	Orwell	Smiley	The heat in the jail was appalling, [MASK] continued. The cell had an iron table at the centre and iron cattle rings let into the wall. “They brought him manacled, which seemed silly because he was so slight.
<name>Mask</name>	Mask	Control	Reports came in at the rate of two or even three a month, and the standard, according to the customers, continued excellent, but [MASK]’s name was seldom mentioned and he was never invited to comment. Occasionally the evaluators produced quibbles.
<name>Chandler</name>	Chandler	Smiley	Opening the Testify file, he tried to read it. It wasn’t all that thin, but it wasn’t fat, either. It looked pretty much like a token volume, as [MASK] had said: the first serial was taken up with a description of what wasn’t there.
<name>Alleline</name>	Alleline	Percy	“Head of London Station? He’s effectively their chief of operations, just as [MASK] used to be when Control was there. They’ve changed all the names, that’s the thing. You know how your old buddies are about names.
<name>Swede</name>	Swede	Boris	It was dark, so I moved into a table nearby. They ordered Scotch, [MASK] paid, and I sat six feet away watching the lousy band and listening to their conversation. The Chinese kid kept her mouth shut and the Swede was doing most of the running.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Percy	‘It’s not deduction at all,’ he says, ‘it’s induction.’ ‘My dear [MASK], wherever have you been learning words like that; you sound just like a beastly doctor or someone.’ My dear, he was cross!
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Smiley	The sweat had come through his silk shirt as well; he looked as if he had been under a shower. Curry not being a food he cared for, [MASK] ordered two more krugs to wash away the taste. “So that was the first part of the story.
<name>Stoner</name>	Stoner	Smiley	We got plenty of other fish to fry apart from them, don’t we? What about all the black men: are they going to be reading the gory details in the Walla Walla News in a week’s time?” Or his constituents, [MASK] thought.
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Jim	All right, he was shaken. Who wouldn’t be? He arrived knowing there’d been a God-awful shooting party and that was about all. But when I told him that it was [MASK] who’d been shot, he looked at me like a madman.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jackie	“Was that the word I used? Good Lord, how very pompous of me!” From the direction of the house came the sound of [MASK]’s continued crying. “You never had any, did you?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Gerald	And that’s why his fellow conspirators look to him to deal with [MASK] and agree to the terms, the financial terms. Because they do want money. Lots of money. I should have mentioned that. In that respect, secret services and their customers are like anyone else, I’m afraid.
<name>Witchcraft</name>	Witchcraft	Merlin	It was not till he went back to the files which appraised the Witchcraft product that he came on the solution. The house was paid for in late March. Occupancy followed immediately. From the same date exactly, [MASK] began to acquire a personality, and it was shaped here in the customers’ comments.
<name>James</name>	James	Smiley	“You’ll take the job, clean the stables? Go backwards, go forwards, do whatever is necessary? It’s your generation, after all. Your legacy.” [MASK] had pushed open the paddock gate and slammed it behind him.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Sam	You were duty officer.” [MASK] smoked brown cigarettes that smelt of cigar. Lighting one, he let the end catch fire, then watched it die to an ember. “Writing your memoirs, old boy?” he enquired. “We’re reopening the case.”
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Mo	He instructed his wife or mistress or whatever”—he said this as if he had neither—“pardon again, [MASK], to follow him in one week, which they have not yet done, apparently. This information only reached us yesterday, so we’ve a lot of footwork to do yet.
<name>Carlo</name>	Carlo	Tarr	“Why?” said [MASK] at last. The jauntiness was all gone. He had a prison pallor; he had lost weight and as he sat on the bed with the gun on the pillow beside him, his eyes sought them out nervously, each in turn, trusting nothing.
<name>Elspeth</name>	Elspeth	Millie	[MASK] might, she might not; her little hard eyes had fixed on him with scorn. He was studying the switch panel, feeling in his pocket as he did so. “What’s he doing? He’s not to do that. Stop him.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Toby	I knew straight away something was wrong but I thought it was [MASK].” She fell silent. “Damn fire,” she muttered morosely. “You only have to turn your back and it goes out.” She had lost interest. “You know the rest.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Toby	He wanted to lull them, demonstrate to them that he suspected nothing. He knew now that he was the target of what [MASK] would call a grand-slam operation. On foot they were working teams of seven. The cars changed so often he couldn’t count them.
<name>Lucien</name>	Lucien	Thomas	I would prefer to give you my life, [MASK], and naturally my body, but I think it more likely that this wretched secret will be all I have to make you happy. Use it well!’”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Percy	However, when he telephoned me half an hour ago he was positively fulsome. He even congratulated me. He regards the document as genuine and is seeking our permission—[MASK]’s, I suppose I should say—to apprise his fellow sea-lords of its conclusions.”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Guillam	“In quarantine,” said [MASK] tersely. “Oh, I’m sure. Of course. I don’t mean to pry. Merely, can he get around and so on? He did recover; he can walk?
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bill	He was already lifting an arm as he said this. “With you in a minute!” he called across the lawn. “Set one up for me!” Two girls were hovering on the other side of the wire fence. “Is that [MASK]’s joke?”
<name>Tobe</name>	Tobe	George	Disruption job to make the Circus chase its own tail. Tore my ears off for disseminating half-baked rumours. I said to him, [MASK]: ‘Old boy,’ I said. ‘Tobe, I was only reporting, old boy.
<name>Slav</name>	Slav	Jim	Because the General didn’t want them to, said the Slav. They drove for half an hour by [MASK]’s watch, heading north east at an average of thirty kilometres an hour. The track was winding and steep and tree-lined.
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Smiley	and I was travelled to death.” Out of a sense of manners rather than appetite, [MASK] set to work on his food, eating several mouthfuls joylessly before resuming his narrative. “There,” he muttered, “that shouldn’t offend the cook.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Guillam	Beside it, a six-foot wardrobe safe, new. [MASK] wondered how on earth the floor took the strain. On its top, bottles of South African sherry; glasses, plates. Tuesday, he remembered: London Station’s informal lunch meeting.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Jim	He was supposed to catch the thirteen-eight arriving Brno sixteen-twenty-seven. It was cancelled, so he took some wonderful stopping train, a special for the football match, which called at every other lamp-post, and each time [MASK] reckoned he could pick out the hoods.
<name>enfold</name>	enfold	Smiley	The night landscape seemed to [MASK] suddenly innocent; it was like a great canvas on which nothing bad or cruel had ever been painted. Side by side, they stared down the valley over the clusters of lights to a tor raised against the horizon.
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Jim	Her signature. Engraved.” “Did he mention how he came by it? What did he say, [MASK]? Come on, I’m not going to weaken at the knees just because some Russian hood made a bad joke about me.”
<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	Lacon	Then he promptly bounded off again, gaining ground. They completed two laps in this way before [MASK] broke the silence. “When you came to me a year ago with a similar suggestion, I’m afraid I threw you out. I suppose I should apologise.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Lacon	“Do you want these back,” [MASK] demanded, “or have you done with them? They can’t be very enlightening, since they don’t even contain the reports.” “Tonight, please, if you don’t mind.”
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Ellis	First he would deny everything and stick to his cover. After a fight, he would admit to being a British spy and give his workname [MASK], so that if they published it, the Circus would at least know he was alive and trying.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Smiley	“After all, you could hardly leave them behind to the mercy of that inquisitive Frenchman, could you?” Waiting, [MASK] appeared to examine the lexicon cards, reading off the words longways and sideways. There was nothing to them: they were random words.
<name>Janet</name>	Janet	Jefferson	An extra switch was fitted in each finger panel. Any time [MASK] or one of the boys, as she put it, wanted to go over to record, he had only to get up and turn down the left-hand light switch.
<name>Cherviakov</name>	Cherviakov	Fawn	That the surveillance on his flat did not begin till last night—he was sure of it. That over the weekend he was in the clear unless [MASK], the captive baby-sitter, had doubled, which would have been hard for him.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Percy	It just happens that I don’t believe it; I don’t believe [MASK] is capable of going out and buying himself a top Russian spy and manning his own boat from then on. I think he’d mess it up.”
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Smiley	Leaving the cage, the white figure strode towards a glazed kiosk, built between two iron pillars, and with his fine head beckoned [MASK] to follow. As he went, he pulled the gloves off his hands. They were leather gloves, hand-stitched and quite expensive.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Smiley	And, as if he were royalty: “We have dubbed his product ‘Witchcraft.’ ” He had used the identical form of words, [MASK] noticed, in a top-secret and personal letter to a fan at the Treasury, requesting for himself greater discretion in ad hoc payments to agents.
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Ann	In the afternoon, quite against the local by-laws, he lit a coal fire and sat before it reading among his German poets or writing letters to [MASK], which he seldom completed and never posted. When the telephone rang, he went to it quickly, only to be disappointed.
<name>Macmillan</name>	Macmillan	Mendel	The lower part was panelled, the upper part glass. Lifting the receiver, he laid the file at his feet and heard [MASK] tell him he needed a new gear-box; the job could cost anything up to a hundred quid.
<name>George</name>	George	Guillam	In that moment, [MASK] felt not merely betrayed but orphaned. His suspicions, his resentments for so long turned outward on the real world—on his women, his attempted loves—now swung upon the Circus and the failed magic that had formed his faith.
<name>Aschenbach</name>	Aschenbach	Ann	His attention had settled on a tiny van Mieris head in chalk. “And I fancy this very much,” he said. “[MASK] gave it me.” “Amends?” “Probably.” “Must have been quite a sin.
<name>Williamson</name>	Williamson	Bland	I cannot honestly say which of my three assistants deserves most praise. The energy of [MASK] has been an inspiration to us all...” He was replying to the Minister’s suggestion that those responsible for Witchcraft should be honoured in the New Year’s list.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jim	Big men, small men, old, young, crooked, straight—they were a single army of indistinguishable dangers. To say no to [MASK] was more than he could bear; to say yes was to shoulder the whole awful responsibility of disappointing him.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Roach	But the whole tangled shape of him was stock-still, he was like an animal frozen against its background: a stag, thought [MASK], on a hopeful impulse; something noble. “Who the hell are you?” asked a very military voice.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Jim	“The facts were known,” [MASK] repeated, glaring. “He ordered me not to approach anyone or try to get my story heard, because it was all being taken care of at the highest level and anything I did might spoil the kill.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Bill	Isn’t he a cousin of hers, or something? I always thought you’d have been so good together, you and [MASK], if it could have worked. You’d have brought back the old spirit. Instead of that Scottish twerp.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Millie	From then on, the system was voice-activated; that is to say, the tape deck did not turn unless somebody was speaking. “And where are you while all this goes on, [MASK]?” She remained downstairs, she said, as if that were a woman’s place.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Roach	“Call out when she moves, right? North, south, whichever way she rolls. Understand?” “Yes, sir.” “Know which way’s north?” “That way,” said [MASK] promptly, and struck out his arm at random.
<name>Case</name>	Case	Jim	“Who did you want to get it? Have a candidate, did you, [MASK]?” And after a long pause: “And they didn’t tell you what happened to the Aggravate network, by any chance?
<name>McDunn</name>	McDunn	Toby	He was crossing the hall when the house bell rang, exactly on time. He lifted the phone and heard [MASK]’s distorted voice howling in the earpiece. He pressed the button and heard the clunk of the electric lock echoing in the stairwell.
<name>Christopher</name>	Christopher	Gerstmann	I sent out for several packs of them—‘packs’ is the American word?—and I remember feeling very strange as I handed money to a guard. I had the impression, you see, that [MASK] saw something symbolic in the transaction of money between myself and the Indian.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Sam	He was surrounded by a sea of files, his skin was yellow, and as he talked he kept breaking off to wipe his forehead with a handkerchief. He scarcely bothered with the usual fan-dance at all, said [MASK].
<name>Exactly</name>	Exactly	Alcoholism	“So that’s what they sacked you for: lying?” “[MASK]. The janitors got a bit of their own back. They’d counted five beer cans in the waste-basket in the duty officer’s lair and reported it to the housekeepers.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Connie	Gradually, [MASK] began humming, then swaying to her own music. He stayed, trying to cheer her up. He gave her more drink and finally it brightened her. “Come on,” she said, “I’ll show you my bloody medals.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Thursgood	When she questioned him, he avoided her eye. “It’s that wretched father of his,” she told [MASK]. “He’s getting him down again.” And by the Friday: “You must write to the mother and tell her he’s having a spell.”
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Alwyn	That would be very kind.” And at the door, as [MASK] let them out: “Your opinion he wants, actually,” he remarked with the officiousness of a small but rising man. “He wishes to consult you for an opinion.”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Haydon	Once or twice, for the hell of it, said [MASK], he had written the odd report himself. It was an amusing exercise to receive, evaluate, and distribute one’s own work. The advantages of Witchcraft in terms of tradecraft were, of course, inestimable.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Camilla	But for that moment it was one of those long, mournful notes which made up [MASK]’s practice scales. She played exactly when she felt like it. At midnight, in the early morning, or whenever. She didn’t give a damn about the neighbours; she seemed quite nerveless altogether.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Mendel	In a gesture of frustration, the Minister slapped his hand on [MASK]’s table, leaving a moist imprint on the polish. “God damn it, I do not understand,” he declared. “That Witchcraft stuff is bloody marvellous!
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	Smiley	There was too much of it; it was like tears all over. The cards no longer interested [MASK]; his eye had settled on a different game. It was a toy, made of two steel rods like the shafts of a pair of tongs.
<name>Haydon</name>	Haydon	Haydon	One’s work, one’s old buddies.” He was a string bean of a man, graceless and boyish: church and spy establishment, said [MASK], the Circus wit. His father was a dignitary of the Scottish church and his mother something noble.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boris	It was eleven-thirty when he made [MASK]’s room. He left at one-thirty with a promise of a meeting next night. By then the situation was all the other way: “We weren’t doing anything improper, mind.
<name>Guillam</name>	Guillam	Percy	“Clear a foreign letter-box, prime a safe house, watch someone’s back, spike an embassy. [MASK]’s Director of Operations, after all. You might think he was acting on instructions from the fifth floor. I can see that happening quite reasonably.”
<name>Lucette</name>	Lucette	Danny	“Has he mentioned his daughter [MASK]?” “Over the weekend he did a lot. Now he’s sort of cooled off about them. I think he’s shut them out of his mind, in view of the emotional side.”
<name>Karla</name>	Karla	Toby	“Running his master spy inside the Circus?” “Sure. They take him off regular work, give him a free hand so’s he can handle [MASK], master spy. We work it all out; hours on end I sit with him.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Jim	Eight minutes. Odd to be pinching files about one’s predecessor. Odd to have [MASK] as a predecessor, come to think of it, and a secretary who held a wake over him without ever mentioning his name.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Bland	On the table, soaked from the earlier rain fall, was a cruet set left over from lunchtime, with a bunch of paper-wrapped cellulose toothpicks in the centre compartment. Taking one, [MASK] spat the paper onto the grass and began working his back teeth with the fat end.
<name>He</name>	He	Smiley	Perhaps the music had been going on a long time and [MASK] only noticed it now. He heard it in imperfect fragments from different parts of the house: a scale on a flute, a child’s tune on a recorder, a violin piece more confidently played.
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Guillam	Brisk and blank. We of London Station have more important friends, said the tone. It was a question of washing some dirty money, [MASK] explained, to finance a ploy against a French diplomatic courier who seemed to be for sale.
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Esterhase	They were groomed and slender—all but the knuckles, which were very broad. Now, at the mention of [MASK], he turned the palms slightly inwards and made a light cage of them as if he had caught a butterfly. “What the hell?”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Connie	Don’t look that way, it’s all neon lights and Sodom. Kiss me. All over the world, beastly people are making our time into nothing; why do you help them? Why?” “I’m not helping them, [MASK].”
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Roach	On Sunday night, an hour after lights out, he had gone noisily to the lavatory, probed his throat, gagged, and finally vomited. But the dormitory monitor, who was supposed to wake and raise the alarm—“Matron, [MASK]’s been sick”—slept stubbornly through the whole charade.
<name>Heaven</name>	Heaven	Lord	I would never have dreamed of letting him take it in the ordinary way; but this was not the ordinary way. Indeed I thought it thoroughly appropriate that he should take her lighter; I thought it—[MASK] help me—expressive of the bond between us.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Connie	I wrote, ‘yes repeat no’ on the bottom and sent it back to him.” She switched to her sergeant-major voice: “ ‘You’re losing your sense of proportion, [MASK]. Time you got out into the real world.’ ”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Peter	The janitors’ returns for the same night were also missing, as were the signals’ returns. “[MASK] thinks it was done recently. There’s a note scribbled on the next page, saying, ‘All enquiries to Head of London Station.’
<name>Stevie</name>	Stevie	Roach	Instead of digging, he had knelt at one corner of the patch and laid the spade on the earth, as if aligning it with something that was out of sight to [MASK]: for instance, the church spire.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Lacon	“Oh, indeed,” [MASK] agreed lavishly. “All that’s a complete mystery. I’m seeing the Minister at eleven,” he confided, in a lower tone. “I have to put him in the picture.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Alwyn	You might just give transport a buzz and ask them to take that thing over for me, will you?” “Will do, sir,” said [MASK]. “Will do. Mind the step, sir.”
<name>Control</name>	Control	Polyakov	Give him ten minutes, he thought. Give him twelve; he’ll have to stop and phone [MASK] on the way. Then he thought, Don’t be silly, he’s done that already from the Circus.
<name>Marlene</name>	Marlene	George	As a good capitalist, I’m sticking with the revolution, because if you can’t beat it spy on it. Don’t look like that, [MASK]. It’s the name of the game these days: you scratch my conscience, I’ll drive your Jag, right?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Guillam	“A Pole in the fur trade who you think might run courier for us.” “Due here any minute.” “Do we know him? I had my people look up the name but they found no trace.” My people, thought [MASK]: I must remember to use that one.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Roach	With all the names, sir, where we sit.” And where the staff sit, too, thought [MASK] sickly. “Anybody sees him again, let me know. Or any other sinister bodies, understand?”
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Sarratt	He spoke fast and angrily, with that same military shortness which was his refuge from intellectual incursions. For four days [MASK] was limbo, he said: “Ate a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot. Walked round the cricket ground.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Guillam	He was a quirkish, loping tracker of a man, sharp-faced and sharp-eyed, and [MASK] had a very precise picture of him just then, leaning over his policeman’s notebook with his pencil poised.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Smiley	She played with it constantly, pitching it at all odd levels. “I’ll give you a whole free hour, dear, all to himself: will you? One of my dunderheads,” she explained to [MASK], long before the boy was out of earshot.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Thomas	She loved sightseeing, she loved foreign kids; why couldn’t she have a kid of her own? A kid born free, not in captivity. She kept saying that: born in captivity, born free. ‘I’m a jolly person, [MASK].
<name>Treasure</name>	Treasure	Merlin	Because they do want money. Lots of money. I should have mentioned that. In that respect, secret services and their customers are like anyone else, I’m afraid. They value most what costs most, and [MASK] costs a fortune. Ever bought a fake picture?”
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Smiley	Then the slam of the door, the explosive anti-climax: if you can hear it, it’s not for you. But [MASK] heard it, and it was for him. He heard the tread of one pair of feet on the gravel, brisk and vigorous.
<name>She</name>	She	Ann	And that’s because you want to.” Or have to? [MASK] would furiously deny it: coercion, she would say, is just another word for doing what you want; or for not doing what you are afraid of. Middle children weep longer than their brothers and sisters.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Pribyl	And after a long pause: “And they didn’t tell you what happened to the Aggravate network, by any chance? To [MASK], to his wife, and brother-in-law? Or the Plato network?
