<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Jonas	It was good to run, and good to come back again to our house and see the kitchen door standing open and the warm light inside. When [MASK] and I came in I shut the door and bolted it and we were ready for the night.
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Constance	“I was weeding the vegetables,” [MASK] said. “I could hear you all laughing.” “I was quite entertaining; I am happy for that now.” He was quiet for a minute, folding and refolding his hands.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Constance	I think, on the whole, it was a pleasant day for all of them; and of course it is much better that they never supposed it was to be their last. I think I am chilly, [MASK].”
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Constance	We had pancakes for breakfast, tiny thin hot pancakes, and my brother had two fried eggs and my wife—although I did not encourage her to eat heavily, since we were living with my brother—took largely of sausage. Homemade sausage, made by [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jonas	I did not look at him; I looked at [MASK], who was looking at him. “I haven’t quite decided what I’m going to do with you,” he said. “But whatever I do, you’ll remember it.”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Jonas	Since they had not found the cellar door they had not found the cooler just inside, and I was pleased that they had not discovered eggs to mix into the mess on the floor. At one time I found three unbroken chairs and set them where they belonged around the table. [MASK] sat in my corner.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	John	The sooner you’re out of it the better.” “—will not be told to shut up by my own brother. We will leave your house, [MASK], if that is really your desire. I ask you, however, to reflect.
<name>Miss Havisham</name>	Miss Havisham	Constance	After I had closed the shutters on both tall drawing-room windows I went along the porch and in, formally, through the front door and into the drawing room where [MASK] stood in dimness now, without the sunlight.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Charles	I was thinking of [MASK]. I could turn him into a fly and drop him into a spider’s web and watch him tangled and helpless and struggling, shut into the body of a dying buzzing fly; I could wish him dead until he died.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Helen	[MASK] said to tell you-—” “Listen.” I could feel them pushing against the door. “No one’s going to bother you. Just tell us, are you all right?” “We’re not going to keep coming, you know.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Constance	I would not touch our mother’s jewelry, but [MASK] had not said anything about our father’s jewelry, had not even come into this room to neaten, so I thought I could open the box and take something out.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Constance	Every day I looked over the boards across the kitchen windows and when I found small cracks I nailed on more boards. Every morning I checked at once to make sure the front door was locked, and every morning [MASK] washed the kitchen.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Constance	[MASK] had cleaned the room where he was living. It looked very empty, because all she had done was take things out; she had nothing to put back because I had carried all of it to the attic. I knew the dresser drawers were empty, and the closet, and the bookshelves.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Ethel	“They’d hold you down and make you eat candy full of poison; I heard that dozens of bad litde boys have gone too near that house and never been seen again. They catch little boys and they—” “Shh. Honestly, [MASK].”
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Constance	They waited; I could feel them pressing their faces close to the glass, longing to see inside. [MASK] looked at me across the table and smiled a litde, and I smiled back; our safeguards were good and they could not see in.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Constance	I thought of the jars and jars so beautifully preserved lying in broken sticky' heaps in the cellar, but [MASK] went down a step or two and said, “No, it’s all right; nothing here’s been touched.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Stella	I saw an opening in the circle around us, and ran again for the trees, but all the Harris boys were there, one on the ground with laughter, and we stopped. I turned again and ran for the house but [MASK] came forward and we stopped.
<name>Elise</name>	Elise	Constance	you may very well ask; was it thoroughly washed? I can reassure you at once. My niece [MASK] washed it before the doctor or the police had come, and you will allow that it was not a felicitous moment to wash a sugar bowl.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Constance	That night we found on the doorsill a basket of fresh eggs and a note reading, “He didn’t mean it, please.” “Poor child,” [MASK] said, putting the eggs into a bowl to go into the cooler.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Constance	Our mother had always served tea to her friends from a low table at one side of the fireplace, so that was where [MASK] always set her table. She sat on the rose sofa with our mother’s portrait looking down on her, and I sat in my small chair in the corner and watched.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Charles	“That young man is not to put a finger on my papers.” “I haven’t even seen your father’s study,” [MASK] said. “We don’t use it. Nothing in there is ever touched.”
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Charles	and I thought I should ask him once. Even the garden had become a strange landscape with [MASK]’ figure in it; I could see him standing under the apple trees and the trees were crooked and shortened beside him. I came out the kitchen door and walked slowly toward him.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Merricat	I wished they were all lying there dead on the ground. “Down in the boneyard ten feet deep.” “[MASK]!” Once when I was going past, the Harris boys’ mother came out onto the porch, perhaps to see what they were all yelling so about.
<name>Mrs. Ramsay</name>	Mrs. Ramsay	Constance	In the morning [MASK] decided to make spice cookies for dinner; that was too bad, because if any of us had known we could have told her not to bother, that Thursday was going to be the last day.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Constance	[MASK] came up behind me and looked out over my shoulder. “They are the children of the strangers,” I told her. “They have no faces.” “They have eyes.” “Pretend they are birds. They can’t see us.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Constance	We had to walk carefully because of the broken things on the floor. Our father’s safe lay just inside the drawing-room door, and I laughed and even [MASK] smiled, because it had not been opened and it had clearly not been possible to carry it any farther than this.
<name>Doc</name>	Doc	Heart	“[MASK],” the doctor said on the porch, and I went another step. No one turned to look at us. Car doors slammed softly and motors started. I looked back once. A little group was standing around the doctor on the steps.
<name>Norma</name>	Norma	Merricat	“Don’t you ever want to leave here, [MASK]?” “Where could we go?” I asked her. “What place would be better for us than this? Who wants us, outside? The world is full of terrible people.”
<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Constance	“But I’ll have to if I—” and [MASK] stopped suddenly, and turned back to the sink and the potatoes. “Shall I put walnuts in the applesauce?” she asked. I sat very quietly, listening to what she had almost said.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Connie	“You’ll have to find something else for her to do, [MASK].” I had made sure of what to say to him before I came to the table. “The Amanita phalloides,” I said to him, “holds three different poisons.
<name>God</name>	God	Constance	“I want to talk to [MASK],” he said outside, the way they always did. It had been a long time since any of them came, but I had not forgotten how they made me feel.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charles	As though she were happy to be doing it at last she came to the table to brush away the dirt and leaves that [MASK] had left there. She brushed them into a paper bag and threw the bag into the wastebasket, and then she came back with a cloth and scrubbed the table.
<name>Charles</name>	Charles	Connie	“It was a sad and horrible time and it’s not going to do [MASK] here any good at all to keep talking about it.” “Young man, you are speaking slightingly, I believe, of my work. A man does not take his work lightly.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Jonas	[MASK] came back and forth with me, amused at our walking silently w hile everyone slept. When I altered our father’s room I took the books from the desk and blankets from the bed, and I put my glass and metal and wood and sticks and leaves into the empty places.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Arthur	“[MASK]’s dead, too. That’s why I’m here.” “He died wealthy, I trust? I was the only brother with no knack for money.” “As a matter of fact.
<name>her</name>	her	Constance	Come back into the world.” Once, even a month ago when it was still winter, words like that would have made [MASK] draw back and run away; now, I saw that she was listening and smiling, although she shook her head.
<name>Simon</name>	Simon	Jonas	“I could have worn this scarf,” he said irritably, and I heard him from the vegetable garden where I had found [MASK] sleeping in a tangle of young lettuce plants. “It’s an expensive thing, and I like the colors.”
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Constance	Without turning I could hear from her voice that she was quiet. I saw the car turn into the driveway and then saw that there were two people in it instead of one; “[MASK],” I said, “she’s brought someone else.”
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charles	“That reminds me,” [MASK] said. “One of these days I’d like to look over the rest of his clothes.” He was quiet for a minute; I thought he was probably sitting down on my bench. Then he went on, very lightly.
<name>George</name>	George	Charles	He looked for a minute as though he might wipe his eyes or blow his nose, but the other man said, “Hurry up” and [MASK] looked back once more, raised his hand sadly, and got into the car.
<name>Assef</name>	Assef	Charles	When I was sure that he could never start it ticking again I put it back gently where I had found it; one thing, at least, had been released from [MASK]’ spell and I thought that I had at last broken through his tight skin of invulnerability.
<name>Uncle Julian</name>	Uncle Julian	Charles	“I’ve told you,” she said to me, “I’ve told you and told you that I won’t hear any more silliness about [MASK]. He is our cousin and he has been invited to visit us and he will probably go when he is ready.”
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Jonas	Shall I make a rhubarb pie?” “[MASK] and I dislike rhubarb.” “But it has the prettiest colors of all; nothing is so pretty on the shelves as rhubarb jam.” “Make it for the shelves, then. Make me a dandelion pie.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Constance	Not that evening, of course. She was not able to play that evening. In the morning we thought she would play in die evening as usual. Do you recall that I was very entertaining in the garden that morning, [MASK]?”
<name>Brinker</name>	Brinker	Charles	and I went into the hall and looked upstairs. [MASK] had left the door to our father’s room standing open and I could see the movement of fire inside. Fire burns upward, I thought; it will burn their things in the attic.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Constance	Then I heard the sound of dishes smashing and at that minute realized that we stood outside the tall windows of the dining room and they were coming very close. “[MASK],” I said, “we have to run.” She shook her head, her hands over her face.
<name>Merricat</name>	Merricat	Constance	And the sun is going to shine after yesterday’s rain. And I am going to make a chocolate mousse for your dinner, my Merricat.” “I love you, [MASK].” “And I love you. Now what will you have for breakfast?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Charles	“But no one wants it.” “One of the links is smashed,” [MASK] said, mourning over the chain. “I could have worn it; what a hell of a way to treat a valuable thing.
<name>Betty</name>	Betty	Ethel	The other child drew near. “They hate little boys and little girls. The difference is, they car the little girls.” “[MASK], stop. You’re terrifying the children. It isn’t true, darlings; she’s only teasing you.”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Constance	as though we might be somewhere in the woods, up a tree perhaps, or under the lettuce leaves, or waiting to spring out at her from behind a bush. When we heard their car start, distantly, we came up out of the cellar and [MASK] turned off her soup
<name>Phaedra</name>	Phaedra	Jonas	[MASK] found me after a while and we lay there together, protected from the rain by the trees crowding overhead, dim and rich in the kind of knowing, possessive way trees have of pressing closer. I looked back at the trees and listened to the soft sound of the water.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Constance	“What took you so long?” he asked when I sat down at the table. “What have you been doing up there?” “Will you make me a cake with pink frosting?” I asked [MASK]. “With little gold leaves around the edge?
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Merricat	“First, however, my lazy [MASK], you will get a pot of water and scrub that mattress clean. And I will wash the kitchen floor again.” We were going to be very happy, I thought.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Charles	I cannot think why it seemed to me that I might simply ask [MASK] to go away. Perhaps I thought that he had to be asked politely just once; perhaps the idea of going away had just not come into his mind and it was necessary to put it there.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Stella	I wished he would not sit so close to me; [MASK] came toward us on the inside of the counter and I washed she would ask him to move so I could get up and leave without having to struggle around him.
<name>Montag</name>	Montag	Charles	It was [MASK]’ fire. When I listened particularly for the fire I could hear it, a singing hot noise upstairs, but over and around it, smothering it, were the voices of the men inside and the voices of the people watching outside and the distant sound of cars on the driveway.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Constance	I thought of my mother’s jewels, since this was a day of sparkling things, but they might not be strong on a dull day, and [MASK] would be angry if I took them out of the box where they belonged, when she herself had decided against it.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Constance	[MASK] stirred, and the leaves rustled. “The way you did before?” she asked. It had never been spoken of between us, not once in six years. “Yes,” I said after a minute, “the way I did before.”
<name>him</name>	him	Charles	I wondered if he would drop it; I would like to have seen [MASK] on the ground, scrabbling after my silver dollars. “It’s not her money,” he was shouting, “she has no right to hide it.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jonas	By the time I found the book he had probably already left his suitcase in the post office and was asking directions. All [MASK] and I knew then was that we were hungry, and we ran together back to the house, and came with the breeze into the kitchen.
<name>Mr. Farraday</name>	Mr. Farraday	Charles	“I thank you; I am not able myself to leap across a room and kneel on the floor and I am gratified to find someone who can. I believe that you are a year or so older than my niece?” “I’m thirty-two,” [MASK] said.
<name>Mrs. DeWitt</name>	Mrs. DeWitt	Constance	When he said good morning back his voice was old and I knew that he was not well. [MASK] would have to stay near him all day. “Is your father home yet, child?” he asked her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Jonas	“And will you make that little cake for [MASK] and me? Pink frosting, with gold leaves around the edge?” She shook her head, and for a minute I thought she was not going to answer me, and then she took a deep breath, and stood up.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Constance	Mondays we neatened the house, [MASK] and I, going into every room with mops and dustcloths, carefully setting the little things back after we had dusted, never altering the perfect line of our mother’s tortoise-shell comb.
<name>they</name>	they	Constance	We had to get down the steps and into the woods to be safe; it was not far but the headlights of the cars shone across the lawn. I wondered if [MASK] would slip and fall, running through the light, but we had to get to the woods and there was no other way.
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Charles	“Young man, you are speaking slightingly, I believe, of my work. A man does not take his work lightly. A man has his work to do, and he does it. Remember that, [MASK].”
<name>the sun</name>	the sun	Jonas	And dumplings with his chicken tonight.” “Do you need me?” “No, my Merricat. Run along, and wear your boots.” The day outside was full of changing light, and [MASK] danced in and out of shadows as he followed me.
<name>Mrs. Grose</name>	Mrs. Grose	Constance	“But I won’t have you frightened.” “Sooner or later,” she said, “sooner or later I will have to take a first step.” I was chilled. “I want to send them away.” “No,” [MASK] said.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Jonas	I ran until I was in the field of grass, in the very center where it was safe, and I sat there, the grass taller than my head and hiding me. [MASK] found me, and we sat there together where no one could ever see us.
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Constance	She washed the sugar bowl.” “There was a spider in it,” [MASK] said. “She told the police those people deserved to die.” “She was excited, madam. Perhaps the remark was mis- construed.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Constance	A spark from his pipe had left a tiny burn on the rose brocade of a chair in the drawing room; [MASK] had not yet noticed it and I thought not to tell her because I hoped that the house, injured, would reject him by itself.
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Charles	I was sorry because he was spending more and more time in his room, taking both his breakfast and his lunch on a tray and only eating his dinners in the dining room under the despising eye of [MASK]. “Can’t you feed him or something?”
<name>curiously</name>	curiously	Constance	My brother sometimes remarked upon what we ate, my wife and I; he was a just man, and never stinted his food, so long as we did not take too much. He watched my wife take sausage that morning, [MASK]. I saw him watching her.
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Jonas	All cat stories start with the statement: “My mother, who was the first cat, told me this,” and I lay with my head close to [MASK] and listened. There was no change coming, I thought here, only spring; I was wrong to be so frightened.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Constance	“/ would care, if you looked more beautiful.” [MASK] laughed, and said, “I’m silly now. Why should I want to wear pearls?” “They’re better off in the box where they belong.”
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Charles	I saw faces laughing, and faces that looked frightened, and then someone called out, very near to us, “What about the women, and the old man? Anyone see them?” “They had plenty of warning,” [MASK] shouted from somewhere, “they’re all right.”
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Constance	I wanted to run; if I could have run to the end of our land and back I would have been all right, but [MASK] was alone with them in the drawing room and I had to hurry back.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Jonas	I ran all the way to the creek, but [MASK] was faster, and was waiting for me when I got to my hiding place. It was good to run, and good to come back again to our house and see the kitchen door standing open and the warm light inside.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Charles	I supposed I could bury the box again after he had gone, but I was not pleased. I came to the top of the stairs and watched [MASK] proceeding down the hall to the study; he was clearly going to put my silver dollars into our father’s safe.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Constance	I chose the library books with care. There were books in our house, of course; our father’s study had books covering two walls, but I liked fairy tales and books of history, and [MASK] liked books about food.
<name>Ernest</name>	Ernest	Constance	I know my brother was home for lunch.” “We had a rarebit,” [MASK] said. “I had been working with the vegetables all morning and I had to make something quickly for lunch.” “It was a rarebit we had.
<name>Okonkwo</name>	Okonkwo	Charles	“But I go to the village on Tuesday,” I said, startled. “You do?” He looked at me across the table, big white face turned directly at me. I was quiet; I remembered that walking to the village was the first step on [MASK]’ way home.
<name>her</name>	her	Constance	I asked [MASK]. “Four or five hours, I think,” she said. “He came by bus to the village, and had to walk from there.” “Then it will take him four or five hours to get home again?”
<name>She</name>	She	Constance	“I am going to put up wild strawberries this year,” [MASK] said to me. “I noticed a considerable patch of them near the end of the garden.” “It’s terribly tactless of her, and she’s keeping we waiting.”
<name>Mrs. Rachel</name>	Mrs. Rachel	Constance	The basket sat on the doorstep, covered with a napkin. I brought it inside and locked the door while [MASK] took the basket from me and carried it to the kitchen. “Blueberry,” she said when I came. “Quite good, too; it’s still warm.”
<name>Momma</name>	Momma	Charles	Time was running shorter, tightening around our house, crushing me. I thought it might be time to smash the big mirror in the hall, but then [MASK]’ feet were coming heavily down the stairs and through the hall and into the kitchen.
<name>my mother</name>	my mother	Constance	Where’s my cat?” “He went off chasing butterflies because you were late. Did you remember eggs? I forgot to tell you.” “Of course. Let’s have lunch on the lawn.” When I was small I thought [MASK] was a fairy princess.
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Charles	“Run,” [MASK] said, at the front door now, wrenching at the lock, you fool.” “I have not done much running in the past few years, young man. I see no cause for this hysteria; there is time to gather my papers.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Constance	Perhaps, I told myself, I might try my hand at mending the broken step. “What are you laughing about now?” [MASK] asked me. “I am thinking that we are on the moon, but it is not quite as I supposed it would be.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Jonas	I could feel them pushing against the door. “No one’s going to bother you. Just tell us, are you all right?” “We’re not going to keep coming, you know. There’s a limit to how much friends can take.” [MASK] yawned.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Constance	I lay near him on the marble bench our mother had liked to sit on, and [MASK] knelt in the dirt, both hands buried as though she were growing, kneading the dirt and turning it, touching the plants on their roots.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Constance	“I do not seem to have any information on whether your father took his cigar in the garden as usual that morning.” “I’m sure he did,” [MASK] said. “That cat’s been fishing in the creek,” she told me.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Dunham	“That’s right,” [MASK] said, and he laughed. “The way they live up in their fine old private estate, with dieir fences and their private path and their stylish way of living.” He always went on until he was tired.
<name>Laura</name>	Laura	Constance	[MASK] went to the mantel and set the Dresden figurine in its place below the portrait of our mother and for one quick minute the great shadowy room came back together again, as it should be, and then fell apart forever.
<name>Fluffy</name>	Fluffy	Jonas	She was the most precious person in my world, always. I followed her across the soft grass, past the flowers she tended, into our house, and [MASK], my cat, came out of the flowers and followed me.
<name>Mrs. Hudson</name>	Mrs. Hudson	Merricat	“First we must neaten the house, even though it is not the usual day.” “The house,” she said. “Oh, [MASK].” “I had no dinner last night,” I told her.
<name>Mrs. Bains</name>	Mrs. Bains	Constance	“Do you know,” [MASK] said, looking into a pot on the stove, “I think that soon we will be picking lettuce; the weather has stayed so warm.” “On the moon,” I said, and then stopped.
<name>eat</name>	eat	Constance	“Let it burn,” the woman called. I was hungry and I wanted my dinner, and I wondered how long they could make the fire last before they put it out and went away and [MASK] and I could go back inside.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Constance	Then she said, “The preserves,” and turned to the cellar door; it was closed and I hoped that perhaps they had not seen it, or had perhaps not had time to go down the stairs. [MASK] picked her way carefully across the floor and opened the cellar door and looked down.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Charles	“If I could just talk to her,” [MASK] said. “You can get some pictures of the house, anyway, with me standing here. Or knocking at the door; I could be knocking frantically at the door.”
