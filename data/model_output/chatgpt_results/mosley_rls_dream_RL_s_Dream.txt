<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Soupspoon	[MASK] sighed and left three blank minutes on the tape. When he finally spoke again his voice was deeper and hoarse like a man who had just recently awakened from a full night's sleep. "You know I played a whole lotta music in these fifty years since he died.
<name>Jasmine</name>	Jasmine	Mavis	She closed her eyes and imagined the whiteness of the room. The last Jelly Roll record fell from the stalk-stack. Before the song was over [MASK] was far away watching a boychild play with his new spinning top. He wanted to know how flies landed upside down.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Chevette	Candles flickered around the room and the muted sound of salsa music came in through the walls. [MASK] was beautiful and knew it; but she didn't care about it. She was open and friendly and sure enough in herself that she didn't mind if somebody might not like her.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Kiki	"I can work. I might be past sixty-five, but somebody needs a sweeper or counterman. 'Cause if you can't work then you dead already." "You can stay with me as long as you want," [MASK] said.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Luther	"Sir?" "[MASK]'s sick, officer," the redheaded girl said. "I've been in the hospital and I just got out today and when I got here I found these men doing..." "Naw, naw, officer.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Atwater	And she walked with steady one-after-the-other steps, not like the regular customers ambling to and fro, seeing and being seen. [MASK] saw her at the front door and then he saw her in the bar through his flap.
<name>Eddie</name>	Eddie	RL	The small tape recorder caught the sagging springs of her sitting down and the loud scratch of the match she used to light her cigarette. . . When we finished our pint, [MASK] came up with two bits for another one and then I scraped together my change for a third.
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Mavis	One time he came home from the road and there wasn't anything cooking on the stove. Everything in the house had been painted white. The walls, the floor, the wood chairs, and even the little dolls [MASK] had saved from when she was a child.
<name>Margaret</name>	Margaret	Kiki	The dress was in an old style, maybe as far back as the sixties, and a little too short, [MASK] thought, for an older woman. She was hatless. Her hair was straightened and tied back into two interwoven braids.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Soupspoon	"Who are you?" [MASK] could hear the big Negro's fear. Big old coward when it came to white folks; even a scrawny little white girl scared him. "Are you okay, sir?"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	RL	Real money. An' no green-toof sheriff gonna dare an' take it." "I been up there," [MASK] said. "I seen it—seen it all. Me an' this other blues boy go on up there.
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Mavis	[MASK] went right up to him and jerked him by his arm. "Pick up that damn glass, boy! You think people want holes in they tires just 'cause you bored?" From the look on his face.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Soupspoon	Both men and the Rasta-boy tried to get away from her wild attack. [MASK] watched the white girl, really she was a woman past thirty, swinging her bag with one hand and holding her side with the other. Everything seemed slow to him though.
<name>George</name>	George	Kiki	Soup." "Me stayin' here an' livin' off you ain't right, [MASK]. An' I need my own place." "But how can you pay for it? You don't have money." "I can work.
<name>he</name>	he	Atwater	The blade was from a five-inch metal saw that had been shaped and sharpened by a grinding stone. It was black and jagged but [MASK] could see that it was still sharp. The haft was wadded cork wound tightly around with fly-green fishing twine.
<name>Maya</name>	Maya	Kiki	That's where you find angels. I'd no sooner spend a evenin' with an angel than I'd whore out here in these streets. I'd kill myself before I'd break bread with a angel." [MASK] was under the spell of the older woman's words.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Soupspoon	[MASK] brought them sweet rolls and hot coffee with skim milk and Sweet 'n Low just the way they liked it. Then he'd sit in the maze of cushioned chairs and bask in the slatted sunlight that came through the blinds.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kiki	[MASK] lay in her bed a long time before sleep came. That night, like every night, she would almost fall off to sleep, she would be on the edge, and then the image of a man's pale lips arose, and the smell of the dank basement under the new house.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Kiki	Then he released his hold on her mouth. She had never, before or since, tasted anything so rich and pure as the air in that deadly wood. Her lungs tingled with the beginnings of pneumonia as her father blundered around lost, unable to find her. "[MASK]!
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	Kiki	But when he played the tape back he was reminded of a hapless baby-sitter trying to tell a fairy tale that he couldn't remember. Finally he asked [MASK] to help. “Just listen to me," he said. “I'm a storyteller.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Kiki	When it was over she went up the basement stairs while he washed off his hand in the sink. Her mother stood at the door holding a tight ball of handkerchief. [MASK] tried to let her skirts hang down to cover the red welts on her legs.
<name>nurse</name>	nurse	Kiki	And," he said, taking a handful of small aluminum packets from a drawer, "give him these for any pain he might feel." "Yes, doctor," [MASK] said, taking the dozen or so packages.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Randy	To the left of [MASK]'s booth two young men had a concession where they sold bootlegged audiocassettes that were counterfeited to look like the originals. To the right a group of potters sold wares from their studio; heavy cups and wobbling plates that old ladies swooned over before passing them by.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Randy	After they were gone, [MASK]'s mother sat down at the kitchen table in a foul mood. She refused to answer any questions about the couple that had come or make guesses as to how they made the mistake.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Elma	She pulled on him until they were kissing across the table. "You better let up from him, bitch," [MASK] said in a serious tone. "I'm the one found'im. He mine tonight."
<name>He</name>	He	Randy	[MASK] supported her on the way up the stairs. She knew she shouldn't have been yelling, that he wouldn't have dropped her. But she couldn't help it. It didn't matter, because nobody came to her aid; nobody called the police.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Soupspoon	Her skin was high yellow and there was a deep brown mole riding on the words in her throat. A big fly buzzed lazily above her head. [MASK] couldn't hear its drone above the hum of the refrigerator behind the bar.
<name>Brandon</name>	Brandon	Bob	"You a homo, huh?" "We say 'gay' these days," [MASK] said. "Yeah, I know. But you know, sometimes a word just sticks in your mind and nuthin' else seems right.
<name>Janine</name>	Janine	Mavis	[MASK] exhaled and stubbed out the cigarette; she only smoked it halfway. "I used to think I liked a hard-lovin' man. Like when you see a stallion or a bull bitin' and fuckin' wit' that crazy look in they eyes."
<name>He</name>	He	Randy	I mean it's no big thing, I just, I just want to spend a little time with him. That's all. But I could come over to your place tomorrow morning after he leaves—or after I leave him." [MASK] didn't speak.
<name>Bob</name>	Bob	Kiki	" "I wouldn't leave without tellin' you, honey. I might not tell them, but I'd tell my friends." When they heard that [MASK] had been stabbed, they were all excited, wanted to know every detail.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Hamela	"When [MASK] an' me be playin' it's not like I'm old and she's a baby. We like each other an' we like to laugh. There's all these young men walkin' around cussin' an' talkin' mean.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Soupspoon	"Shit," the white moving man said. "Watch your mouth." That was the deep-voiced, soft-skinned policeman. The fat kid came over and they talked a minute. [MASK] watched the two children as they settled his fate.
<name>he</name>	he	Soupspoon	Outside a dog was lifting his leg against the big yellow sofa. The cushions were gone, somebody's bed now. The bed was still there, so filthy that [MASK] hoped they'd pass by quickly so that no one would make fun of him.
<name>he</name>	he	Soupspoon	On the ground ants made their ways haltingly, stopping now and then to rub antennae and move on. "Everybody's doin' their business. The world don't stop for you or nobody else," [MASK] said at last as he watched two hard-eyed starlings chase a sparrow away from a crumb.
<name>he</name>	he	Rudolph	He always the house in a crap game. He always makin' money." "So at least [MASK] ain't no fool, huh?" "That don't mean he ain't gonna make a fool outta me, or some other poor girl."
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Chevette	He felt the beginnings of an erection with surprise. "I better be gettin' outta here. I mean gettin' home," he said. [MASK] didn't let go of the fingers on her leg. "What do you dream about, uncle?"
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Hare	"No lie, man," [MASK] said, sounding almost like a black man talking. "She's big an' she got a twenty-two pistol—nobody mess with her. Nobody." "And she's your girl?
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cholo	"A man just left here ten minutes ago an' said he was cornin' back to settle a debt with [MASK] there. We locked the door to keep trouble away." "You should have called the police if you were threatened," the cop said.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Soupspoon	"Shhhhh! Look!" [MASK] followed the the direction of the lizard-skin finger pointing over the sill and into the room across the way. There again he saw the head lying in repose. He saw now that it was a woman's head.
<name>Willy</name>	Willy	Soupspoon	There was some time away from home, there had to be. By bus usually, but also by train and even a car now and then. Never in his whole life had [MASK] been airborne. There were times that he was away from home for two months and more.
<name>Miss Merle</name>	Miss Merle	LaToya	The door stuttered on its rails and then slid open again. A sneer of grim satisfaction passed across [MASK]'s pear face. Two more black girls came running in. One screaming, one laughing and bumping from behind.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Kiki	There was a stack of new bills, probably from a cash machine, and a wallet. [MASK] took everything and jumped up over the body and down the remaining stairs. Most of the blood was on her purple jacket, so she dropped that into a city trash can on the comer.
<name>Miss Millie</name>	Miss Millie	Kiki	[MASK] had given him a little cash to carry around. He hated to take from a woman, but he couldn't help it. He wanted to give to this big dumb white man because he had helped when nobody else seemed to care.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Kiki	His nostrils flared as if he were inhaling the breath of them. [MASK] wanted to get up and tell him to get away. But the thought of moving made her lay the palm of her hand against the soft flesh below her ribs—feeling for the dampness of blood.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Kiki	"I'll be goin' now. But lemme tell you somethin' before I do that." "Yes?" [MASK] found that she had to hold her head sideways in order to see straight. "You in the wrong business here." "What?"
<name>Trudy</name>	Trudy	Kiki	The girls sat in a bunch across the aisle. They were all large. The two latecomers wore jeans and sat on either side of the girl with the big green legs. The one on [MASK]'s left had on a bulky brown sweater from which her stomach and breasts bulged sensually.
<name>the killer</name>	the killer	Maretha	The floor around the man and his killer cleared of people. In between the screams and shouts five more shots sounded, each one like the hack of an ax into thick bark. I told you you'd never leave. That's what [MASK] had said.
<name>Soupspoon</name>	Soupspoon	Billy	"But you see." [MASK] never lost his broken smile. "I'ma be like a agent. I'ma have me a lotta guys gettin' gigs an' like that. But Soupspoon gonna need a manager. Thatta be you.
<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Mavis	I thought that if I took him in I could p'otect him." [MASK] laughed and shook her head at the white floor. "I know better now. Men like him ain't never had no chance at no normal life.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Soupspoon	There followed a long silence. In a comer of the vestibule a water beetle was dying on his back, waving his hairy brown legs at the light. [MASK] raised his foot but then put it back down. Who knows what he thinkin'.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Kiki	[MASK] could feel every step on the inside where the doctor said that the stitches would dissolve on their own. Some kind of plastic thread melting right up inside her. The local train was waiting across the track. The girls were there, also the old lady with the shopping bag.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bob	"There must'a been forty people listenin' an' dancin' to me and [MASK]. Forty poor-as-the-day-they-was-bom colored souls. We was higher than a holy roller's shout when the county sheriff come up. "
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	JD	Their bodies came together except where the knife was. Their lips touched, men's kiss. And the knife came out and went in again. “In and out," the ambulance driver had said. "He's lucky [MASK] didn't twist it."
<name>probably</name> (There is no clear indication of a proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	probably (There is no clear indication of a proper name in this sentence, so this is a guess based on the context.)	Sheldon	"I'll see if I have anything about this in the files, [MASK]." She went out to her desk and put the folder in its alphabetical place in the file cabinet. That was at ten-thirty in the morning.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Randy	"I don't need you to help me, [MASK]," she said, but she leaned against him when he put his arm around her and she didn't struggle when he took her bag. He smelled of patchouli oil and sweat, of old magazines.
<name>Joad</name>	Joad	Bob	The whole mill was up on stilts above the river. The moon was shinin' back there, half-faced and yellow. And the woods was a rough black color under it. [MASK] was naked an' sit-tin' on a empty five-gallon shine barrel.
<name>her brother</name>	her brother	Soupspoon	Ain't nuthin' they could do about cancer." The young woman stood up and threw her hair back. She took a seat next to [MASK] on the waxy paper and opened a dark folder that had ghostly X-ray photographs of his bones.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cort	I did it 'cause [MASK] needed his momma an' I couldn't go to no jail. I mean, it wasn't my fault that them people died, but they woulda taken me down to the women's prison if they wanted. So I run.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Gerry	It's better to be a big man, he always said, if you got a girl's voice. And [MASK] was big. He was barrel-chested and long-armed. His face was all pushed together and sharp like a wedge.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Bob	I wanted to yell out for that white man to put our guitars somewhere safe, but then I worried that if I said somethin' he mighta popped a string or worse just for spite. "That's when [MASK] started in. 'Ohhh, momma yeah.
<name>Dean</name>	Dean	Billy	[MASK] slaps the cushions and she just has to kiss him. Her tongue pushing against his teeth for a moment and then past, inside his mouth. She licks the stale smoke from his last cigarette. "Yeah," she answers. "Where is he?"
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Atwater	"You done made the boy sick." She moved quickly to get up off the bench and let [MASK] out. He slid over with no problem, but standing up was a whole new experience. One leg gave way and then the other.
<name>Lena</name>	Lena	Rudy	"[MASK]? What you want? I ain't got the time for you now. I'm up here wit' my flowers." "Did you get my checks, ma'am?" "Yeah. Now I told you not t'come by wit'out callin' first."
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Kiki	And the same goes for you." "Well, then that's okay. I mean, I don't care what you do either." The tears in his eyes didn't sound in his words. [MASK] fought the urge to laugh. "
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Sheldon	Huh?" [MASK] looked up at her. His shoulders were so small that no off-the-rack suit fit him right, but nobody in his family had ever had a suit tailored except for funerals or weddings. "I'm waiting.
<name>Lucius</name>	Lucius	Fez	All the operators who weren't white hated [MASK]. He called them names behind their backs; often loud enough for them to hear. But he was the big boss on the day shift, and he let all kinds of things go on.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Alfred	All I wanna know is the name'a the man that did. I want to say about us and what we did. I don't want them to forget. But I ain't blamin' you." “But I did do it," [MASK] said.
<name>childbirth</name>	childbirth	Cort	"I cain't give you no chirren, daddy," she sobbed. "I had bleed-in' after [MASK] and the doctor cut me up on the inside. He cut me an' now I cain't have no more kids."
<name>Ma Rainey</name>	Ma Rainey	Migrants	But you don't know our place back then. We was the bottom of the barrel. We were the lowest kinda godless riffraff. [MASK] and roustabouts, we was bad from the day we was bom. Blues is the devil's music an' we his chir-ren.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Soupspoon	Her face was black and streaked, but she was a white woman. "Get away from here! Go on! Git off!" The woman took a step closer, and [MASK] pushed himself up again; the pain made him see glitter in the darkening sky.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kiki	His hair, blond at birth, had whitened too from the elements and neglect. His skin was almost colorless but dark from bright sun and processed red wine. White men would have a hard time claiming this man. "Who're you?" [MASK] asked.
<name>His wife</name>	His wife	Mavis	He finally got so frustrated that he left and went down to a friend's house for two days. When he came back. [MASK] had stopped crying. She was sitting at the kitchen table, her suitcase packed and her traveling clothes on. ''Where you goin'.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Chevette	[MASK] stayed on the couch in the family living room. Everything was nice except that there was no electricity and no phone. The youngsters went around lighting candles when they got home. There were candles all over the house; in the living room, kitchen, and toilet.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Kiki	He patted [MASK]'s shoulder and said, "Oh, that's too bad, honey. You know I'd need more than a bottle of booze to open the database for a hex dump. A lot more." "You did that on purpose.
<name>Calpurnia</name>	Calpurnia	Elma	The sweetness in her voice was not lost on him. "My birfday," he whispered. "What? Talk up." "My birfday today." [MASK] showed her snaggle teeth again. "Yo' birfday?
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Rudy	When he was playing was the only time that he was ever happy. And she was only happy in the presence of memories and bright white light. The intercom cried again. "I heard ya, [MASK]! Go on home now!
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Soupspoon	"What?" "Kiki ain't a bad girl..." "I didn't say ..." "Excuse me, ma'am, but just let me say these here few words. That's all I ask." [MASK] put out his hands.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Soupspoon	Then she brought the back of her hand to her mouth. "I'm sorry, honey. I shouldn'ta said that. That was wrong." "You never really told me everything about that one time you met'im." It was all [MASK] wanted.
<name>Two-Bit</name>	Two-Bit	Randy	"No, sir. We got this. Jump in." "Naw, uh-uh, don't worry 'bout me. We goin' out. Tell Kiki that I'll be back later on." [MASK] looked at the girls and gave a quick smirk.
<name>he</name>	he	Soupspoon	You et?" He'd shake his head and then she'd kiss him for being so good and letting her sleep. More than sixty years later [MASK] still felt a pang against his heart when he thought of her rising up from the straw-filled bed.
<name>Blanche</name>	Blanche	Soupspoon	" "Help you what?" "[MASK] has to have some money." "I could lend you the rent." "Not for me, honey. I got five hundred and some dollars in the bank right now." Her voice softened then.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Soupspoon	The room was populated by half a dozen black men who smoked, drank, and were talking serious in low tones. Everybody looked up to see [MASK] as he walked up to the bar. "I'd like a beer," he told the barmaid. "
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Kiki	I can take you there tomorrow." "If you want to hear what he has to say, then go put your ear to his mouth so you could understand him," [MASK] said. "That's ridiculous."
<name>Mrs. Breedlove</name>	Mrs. Breedlove	Mavis	I'm up here wit' my flowers." "Did you get my checks, ma'am?" "Yeah. Now I told you not t'come by wit'out callin' first." [MASK] lifted her finger from the listen button but then she put it back.
<name>Bonnie</name>	Bonnie	Baby	I had a six-shooter and a big black horse posse close behind. I had a pocket fulla gold my best friend's girl beside. You know they gonna catch up to me someday. [MASK], I really don't mind.
<name>she</name>	she	Kiki	He was a coward actually, and [MASK] was ashamed at herself for ever liking him and coming in at eight-thirty and bringing him coffee, even paying for it with her own money sometimes. After that she never came in before nine-fifteen and sometimes not until nine forty-five.
<name>Miss Stephanie</name>	Miss Stephanie	Mavis	"Just a minute!" she shouted. Then she ran back to the door and opened it, fixing her hair and shaking from the desire to kill somebody. [MASK] wore a plain blue dress with dark seams and a white collar.
<name>Blind Pew</name>	Blind Pew	Soupspoon	"He was a skinny boy," [MASK] continued, "with one good eye and one dead one that floated in its socket. With that dead eye they said he could see past all what we see, into hell—where everyone knows the blues come from anyways.
<name>she</name>	she	Kiki	Her brown hair was braided tightly across the top of her head, and the twist to her lips said that she didn't want to be there. The stranger stared at her, expecting common courtesy, but [MASK] didn't say a word.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Soupspoon	The woman in the bed had turned over and was now sitting up. She was naked as far as she could be seen. Plump and the color of a dusky orange, she was young. [MASK] moved closer to the wall so as not to be seen looking.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Mavis	After the wedding [MASK] came to bed crying. He begged her to tell him what was wrong until the sun was bright through the lace curtains her cousin had given them. He finally got so frustrated that he left and went down to a friend's house for two days.
<name> </name> (There is no proper name to fill in the [MASK] token in this passage)	(There is no proper name to fill in the [MASK] token in this passage)	Soupspoon	They put him in a ward full of men in hospital beds. He was thirsty but he couldn't talk. Nurses came and doctors too. But nobody [MASK] recognized found him in his deathbed. They put needles in his arm and smiled at or ignored him.
<name>George</name>	George	Atwater	[MASK] was scared too but he thought that they'd be safe as long as they stuck together. "Come on," he said. "They ain't gonna bite you." He said it loudly to shame his friend, but he didn't expect the women to hear.
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Atwater	"I ain't crazy, you know," she went on. "[MASK] went outta town to play. He be out in the road for weeks at a time an' then he'd just be back for a coupla days. I liked it—for a while.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Kiki	She knew the feet were headed for the gun case. She wanted to get there first but she'd forgotten where it was. The steps moved faster and louder. [MASK] was afraid. She wanted to wash her hands. Her father's footfalls sounded like gunshots.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Kiki	"They're coming to get him." "The goddamn sun's going down!" [MASK] yelled. "You can't leave him out here at night! This is an old man! An old man!"
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Kiki	While he toweled the liquor from the bed he said, "If I had ever done that my a'ntees woulda hung me up by my ears . . . my wife woulda kilt me." "What wife?" [MASK] wore a light green dress with clusters of tiny red apples printed all over.
<name>Crooks</name>	Crooks	Mavis	It don't even matter that he's old an' maybe gonna die soon. An' ain't no young white girl gonna bear up under that," [MASK] said. "I'm just sayin' it. I don't expect you to hear it."
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Hare	And it wasn't soft fat that she was made of either. [MASK] had a brown paper bag in his hand that had molded itself into the shape of the bottle it carried. He offered the bottle to his date but she declined.
