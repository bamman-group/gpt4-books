<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Nan	But she had to conceal her ill-humour from everyone but [MASK], who listened patiently and with sympathetic concern to her mistress’s perpetual grumbling and sighing. “I’m so damned sick and tired of being virtuous,” she said "wearily one day as she came in from having paid several afternoon calls.
<name>Stephen's</name>	Stephen's	Melinda	“Then I went to the House of Lords for an hour or two.” He returned to his writing and she continued, automatically, to brush [MASK]’s hair. Even now that it had happened she could scarcely believe that he would lie to her.
<name>Flashman</name>	Flashman	Radclyffe	“Sixty-six thousand of ’em!” [MASK] smiled. “How perceptive,” he said, “for a woman!” For several seconds she glared at him, longing violently to smash her fist into his face.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Amber	[MASK] was completely intoxicated, trying to see everything at once, thrilled by the whole noisy, bad-smelling, ill-bred but strangely exciting conglomeration. She felt that the triumph was peculiarly her own—and did not realize they would have stared at any other pretty woman arriving late.
<name>Jennie</name>	Jennie	Sykes	[MASK] had served her purpose, but he knew that it would be foolish to trust her. “There are only a few shillings in the house—and they’ve got to be spent for food. As soon as I can go out I’ll get it for you.”
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	York	“Only that you gave my secret away to his Majesty.” “Gave it away? You lied to me! You told me it was [MASK]’s horoscope you were having cast!” “Even a lie, apparently, was unsafe with you.
<name>Lady Dedlock</name>	Lady Dedlock	Nelly	She waits below in her coach.” [MASK] glanced back at the two men from over her shoulder and screwed up her face to wink. “Speak of the Devil—here’s another one below. You’ll find sack and brandy in the cupboard.
<name>Marcello</name>	Marcello	Judith	[MASK] had heard the two of them arguing, time and again, for the past year or more, and though they had often grown so angry that they began to shout and brandish their fists, at the end they had always agreed to drink a glass of wine and talk about something else.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bruce	Her eyes turned swiftly to the corners and she saw [MASK] look across at her; his expression was sombre and a cynical half-smile touched one side of his mouth. Sick with fury she wanted to hurt him, any way she could.
<name>Lady Brandon</name>	Lady Brandon	Amber	[MASK] smiled faintly but did not answer. And at that moment the footman appeared, followed by two others, who laid before them an elaborate silver tea-table and service with little China porcelain tea-bowls and small crystal glasses for the brandy which always followed.
<name>Mr. Darcy</name>	Mr. Darcy	Amber	Husbands are always such dull fellows—the gentlemen never seem to get married, do they?” ‘‘Not while they can get—not while they can help it,” amended [MASK]. ‘‘Why not? Why don’t they?”
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Bruce	and I never see you again! I hate you! —Oh!—” She covered her face with her hands and began to cry. [MASK] stood watching her for a moment, but at last he put on his hat and started out of the room.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Nan	“Nonsense. [MASK]!” She began pulling on a pair of embroidered, elbow-length gloves. “No one could recognize me in this!” “But suppose they do, mam! You’ll be undone—and for what?”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Amber	She shuffled the cards, dealt, and they played for a while in silence. All at once [MASK] said: “I’m missing a wallet that had a deal of money in it. It was on a nail behind that chest and someone stole it.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Amber	“No, [MASK],” he said at last. “You know that. We’ve talked this all over before.” “But it’s different now! You love me—you told me so yourself! And I know you do! You must!
<name>Lord Stannis</name>	Lord Stannis	Radclyffe	“Attempting to prostitute myself! My God, but you are droll! I laid with the King long ago—while I was still at the theatre! Now, my lord, what do you make of that!” [MASK] smiled, cynical amusement on his thin pressed lips.
<name>He</name>	He	Bruce	For though she was much better she was still gloomy and pessimistic; her usual attitude was completely reversed. [MASK] was so well now that his own confidence and optimism had returned and he tried to amuse her—but it was not easy to do.
<name>Bella</name>	Bella	Amber	“[MASK]—” He continued to stare at her for a moment, his green eyes narrowed, searching. “You’re not—sick?” The words came out with slow forced reluctance. She gave a little sigh.
<name>Bertha</name>	Bertha	Sykes	He did not sleep well that night, aware of her in the parlour, for when she had found evidences of [MASK]’s illness she had refused to go into the nursery. And when he heard her get up, two or three times, and move about he lay tense and apprehensive.
<name>Bathsheba</name>	Bathsheba	Mally	“Gentlemen nowadays,” said [MASK], “you’ll find, have no patience with a woman who troubles ’em in that way. And, Lord knows, with matters as they stand a woman needs what good looks she can be mistress of.”
<name>Scheherazade</name>	Scheherazade	Frances	[MASK] was sitting in bed wearing a white-satin jacket with her hair tumbled over her shoulders, and beside her was a young man who held her hand in his. Both of them looked around in astonishment to find the King looming there in the doorway like a great and angry avenging god.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Bruce	Suddenly she flung it away and faced him squarely, her hands catching at his arms. “Don’t you think that we were meant for each other, [MASK]? You must think so—now.” “What do you mean, ‘now’?”
<name>her</name>	her	John	They were strangely compelling eyes, as though all his being had come to focus in them. Throughout her pregnancy she had hoped that this baby would have eyes like [MASK]’s, hoped with such passionate intensity she never doubted her wish would come true.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Barbara	“Say that again!” “Say what again, your Ladyship?” asked the sentry. [MASK] blew a sigh of relief. “Whew! For a moment you sounded deucedly like a gentleman of my acquaintance—whom I’m not eager to see just now.”
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Amber	His dress was careless, his manners casual, and it seemed likely that his most intellectual interests were horse-breeding and cock-training. Thank God, thought [MASK] at first sight of him, he’s nothing like his father!
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Amber	“You may think so if you like, madame.” [MASK] sprang up out of her chair. “I may think so if I like!” she jeered. Swiftly she crossed the few feet of floor between them and was standing beside her.
<name>him</name>	him	Rex	She hesitated because in her heart she still nursed an imp of ambition, and it would not let her rest. If I marry [MASK], she would think, what will my life be? He’d make me quit the stage and I’d have to start having babies.
<name>Uncle Pumblechook</name>	Uncle Pumblechook	Louis	“It’s done.” “At last. I can scarcely believe it. I’ve worked hard for this, my dear—because I thought it was what you wanted. [MASK] has often accused me of minding your interests more than his own.”
<name>Mrs. Bennet</name>	Mrs. Bennet	Lucilla	She hoped to find a husband for her. [MASK] still talked a good deal of the strictness and formality which had been in vogue during her youth and professed to be very much shocked by the new manners, but nevertheless she had acquired some of those manners herself.
<name>Prince Hal</name>	Prince Hal	Buckhurst	Our value won’t hold up much longer at the present rate of exchange.” The door into the King’s private chambers opened again and [MASK] strolled out with another young man. Two or three others crossed over to speak to them. “What’s the delay?
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Bruce	Oh, I know—you think all that doesn’t make any difference to us now. But it does. You were brought up in a different world from mine. We’re not what we look like from the outside.” “But you’re not like them, [MASK]!”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Barbara	As he turned and went to the door [MASK] sat drumming her nails on the edge of the table, her eyes taking on a dangerous sparkle, and then all at once she pulled away from the maid and got to her feet, raising her arm to secure the last bodkin herself.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Lisbeth	“My services, mad-ame,” he said, his voice and eyes lazily good-humoured, and as he looked her over slowly from head to foot [MASK] blushed crimson and found it difficult to breathe. “We’re looking for a place to eat.
<name>He</name>	He	Buckingham	Then how d’you plan to rid yourself of me?” [MASK] smiled blandly. “Get rid of you, madame? I protest. Why should I? You’re far too useful to me.” “Of course,” she agreed.
<name>Beau</name>	Beau	Beck	Over her glass of clary—a potent drink made of brandy and clary-flowers flavoured with sugar and cinnamon and ambergris—she flipped [MASK] a sly wink. “They say three months is the limit a man will keep now, for fear of losing his reputation as a wit.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Almsbury	“No.” “You’ve come by a winding stair, haven’t you?” “What if I have! I’ve done some things I hated, but that’s over now and I’m where I want to be. I’m somebody, [MASK]!
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Almsbury	The dazed almost dreamy look was gone from her face and she looked alert and challenging. “What does she look like?” [MASK] answered gently, as if afraid of hurting her. “She’s very beautiful.” “She can’t be!”
<name>Miss Harrison</name>	Miss Harrison	Barbara	Now there are just three of us who know it—his Majesty, you, and me—” [MASK] believed the lie, for it sounded plausible, and though she promised him that she would never speak a word of it to 698
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Amber	“So at last you’ve come.” [MASK] looked up in surprise, and then gave him a friendly smile. She was prepared to be no different from usual, in spite of her changed status—at least until she was more secure in her new place.
<name>Cynthia</name>	Cynthia	Frances	“No, [MASK], not more honourable—but I confess I’m glad to hear it. I’m not very much inclined to jealousy—but this time—” He shrugged his broad shoulders, his eyes brooding thoughtfully over her.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Amber	I believe such people are thought to be beautiful and desirable and generally dominated by emotion—if you believe in that kind of nonsense.” He was smiling at her, for [MASK]’s face showed her shock at this heretical statement. “Don’t you believe in it?”
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Amber	Her smocks and gowns and petticoats littered the room, ripped and slashed to pieces. There were torn fans, gloves cut in two, cloaks hacked by scissors, and she had dumped the contents of the chamber-pot onto the remnants of [MASK]’s finest gown.
<name>Beatrix</name>	Beatrix	Amber	You’re not going to fight him!” “I’m going to fight him, and kill him.” Confident that her own life was no longer in danger, [MASK] gave him a scowl of contemptuous disgust.
<name>He</name>	He	Charles	He took a chair beside her and for a moment they sat silent, smiling, looking at each other. [MASK] reached out one hand and covered both her own. “Well,” he said. “It’s done.” “At last.
<name>Madeline</name>	Madeline	Amber	I’m mightily smitten with you, I swear I am. I’m in love with you, madame!” As his impetuosity mounted [MASK] grew more coy, moving as far away as she could get and giving a low giggle in the darkness so that he made a grab for her.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Tempest	Whirling about she sped through the kitchen and up the back flight of stairs, bursting into their room without even a knock. They were lounging, looking out the windows and smoking, and they stared at her in amazement. “[MASK]!
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Amber	She gave her a friendly woman-to-woman smile, obviously trying to convey that she understood what a young wife must go through with her first pregnancy. [MASK], her face still burning from the slap, forced herself to smile in return.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nan	He was almost as much in awe of [MASK] as of his wife or mother. “Oh, heavens! I meant no offense, let me perish! He’s—oh, indeed, he’s really very handsome! Why, yes—he looks like his mother, let me perish!”
<name>my love</name>	my love	Bruce	But you are here, aren’t you? You’re really here. Oh, [MASK], it’s wonderful to have you back!” She held out her arms to him, smiling broadly, her eyes filled with brilliance. “Come here, darling.
<name>Uncle Billy</name>	Uncle Billy	Jack	Then he tossed two of the large boluses into his mouth and gave a hard swallow to get them down, shaking his head mournfully. “I’m damnably peppered-off. [MASK].” At that moment there was a stir in the room.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	9i	What might once have seemed impossible to the point of absurdity now seemed to her quite natural and logical. He let her go and stood with his arms hanging at his sides while he talked, his green-grey eyes hard and uncompromising, [MASK] watching her steadily.
<name>???</name> (Cannot be determined without further context or information)	??? (Cannot be determined without further context or information)	Amber	“What were you doing out there?” demanded [MASK]. He neither looked at her nor made an answer. She repeated the question and this time he gave her merely a sullen glare as he pulled at his coat-sleeve. “You insolent wretch!
<name>Prince Philip</name>	Prince Philip	Charles	Her priests were with her constantly, groaning and wailing and praying, and at every hour the room was filled with people. Royalty could neither be born nor die in quiet and privacy. Hour after hour [MASK] sat there beside her, anxiously watching each move that she made.
<name>she</name>	she	Amber	I’ll break your neck, d’ye hear me?” He made a short vicious kick at her and [MASK] screamed, arms covering her belly, eyes shut. He left the room, slamming the door with a crash.
<name>Milady</name>	Milady	Barbara	“Could you, madame? You’re welcome to try— But I think I please his Majesty quite as well as you— even though my methods may not be the same—” [MASK] made a sound of disgust. “Bah! You squeamish virgins make me sick!
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Frances	To him the young man seemed dull and sottish, too much given up to the bottle, and his money affairs were so bad that he could scarcely be considered a good match for a serving-woman, much less a girl like [MASK] accustomed to luxury since birth.
<name>someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Buckhurst	Slowly she rose, moving backward, and went to stand among the throng that lined the approach to the dais. For several moments she remained half-dazed—but gradually the world began to expand again beyond herself and her feelings. She glanced to the right and found [MASK] there, grinning down at her.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Buckingham	But [MASK] had temporarily lost interest in the Commons and did not care what they thought of him—he could be faithful to his own plans no longer than to a woman. Other events, less sensational but of more importance, were happening at the same time.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Bruce	Oh, [MASK]—I’m never going to look like I did before, I know I’m not! Oh! I hate myself!” He would put his arms about her, smiling as though she were a naughty child, coaxing away her fear and anguish.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Amber	Goodbye.” His hat went back to his head and both men gave a gentle slap of their reins; the horses started off. For a long moment [MASK] sat in frigid stillness, and then with a bursting sob she flung herself back in the seat.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Rex	She had scarcely realized what he was saying but now, as he started out, she looked up suddenly. “Where are you going?” All at once she understood what he had meant. “[MASK]! You’re not going to fight him!”
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Bruce	She looked at him warily, like a trapped animal. “I am, [MASK]. I am going. I’m just going now.” Her fingers, spread out on the quilt before her, moved backward a little, but she could not stir.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	John	Someday we’ll have our home and our family. Someday we’ll have each other—” “Someday, [MASK]!” Her arms caught at him desperately, her face was frightened and her eyes reckless. “Someday! But what if someday never comes!”
<name>He</name>	He	Radclyffe	is there any reason why I shouldn’t leave the house? What the devil have I done to be used like this!” [MASK] paused a long moment before he answered her, gazing reflectively at the pen he turned in his fingers. “This is 610 a strange age.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	Frances	At the Groom Porter’s Lodge they were betting that now [MASK] was a married woman she would have better sense than when she had been a virgin—they expected that she would soon occupy the place which had always been hers for the taking.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bess	By the time they had climbed the stairs and entered the Temple gardens she was beginning to feel excited and eager for whatever adventure might lie ahead; [MASK] and the spilled salt were already far out of her mind. CHAPTER THIRTEEN
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Amber	“Perhaps we’d better not, since there’s no one about.” “What of that?” demanded [MASK] in half-impatient amusement. “Well—you see, madame—his Lordship thinks it best not to dismount when we ride.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Buckingham	There was a coach waiting for him at the door and [MASK] climbed into it. It was but little over half-a-mile to the Tower and all along the way he was greeted with clamorous shouts and cries.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Amber	Please! You’ll be gone so soon!” “I can’t do it, [MASK], and you damn well know it. Anyway, I think it’s time to leave.” He sat up. “Of course!” she cried furiously.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Amber	To dream of pounding spices always foretells matrimony.” “Will I marry the man I love?” “Why, truly, madame, that I can’t say for certain.” But at [MASK]’s stricken expression he again hastened to amend his statement.
<name>Little Nell</name>	Little Nell	Frances	There were ugly red splotches and deep pock-marks on the skin that had been smooth and white as a water-lily, and one eye was partly closed. All that pure and perfect beauty was gone. But it was the misery in [MASK]’s own upraised begging eyes that struck him hardest.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bruce	“Then why don’t we all live here, sir?” [MASK] dropped down so that his weight rested on his heels and his face was almost on a level with his son’s; he put one arm about the boy’s waist.
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Lord	“[MASK], mam, are you goin’ to the play?” “I’m an actress.” “You are!” She seemed both pleased and shocked that her benefactress should be engaged in so exciting and disreputable a profession.
<name>Dr. Rieux</name>	Dr. Rieux	Almsbury	She whirled about, shouting the girl’s name, but [MASK] caught her wrist and brought her up shortly. “You’re not going—if I have to tie you to a bedpost! It is possible to have plague twice, you know.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bruce	“Yes, of course I will. Suppose, [MASK]—suppose—” Suddenly she said it. “Would you like to go with him?” He stared up at her with a look of perfect incredulity, and then he grabbed her hand.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Amber	I’ll see to that. I’ll keep you safe—” [MASK] woke early in the morning on the 5 th of April, conscious of a dull prodding ache in her back. She turned over to make herself more comfortable and then suddenly she realized what it was.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Buckingham	[MASK] heaved himself away from the wall against which he had been leaning. “There’s only one thing to do with them.” But as she started eagerly toward him he made a gesture of one hand, and shook his head. “Oh, no, my dear.
<name>Mrs. Hall</name>	Mrs. Hall	Nan	Three weeks I’ve been coursing this hare—and haven’t caught ’im yet!” [MASK] closed the warming-pan and started into the bedroom with it. “But he’s getting winded, mam. I know he is.”
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Amber	“No. Her hair’s very dark-darker than mine.” [MASK] widened her topaz eyes, politely shocked, as though he had said that she had a hare-lip or bow-legs. Black hair on a lady was not the fashion.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Barbara	“I pray your Ladyship not to take offense—but I must have the names of those gentlemen who may be considered as having had a possible share in your misfortune.” [MASK] frowned a little. “You’ll be discreet?” “Naturally, madame.
<name>Anne</name>	Anne	Nan	It would break his heart!” She turned around all at once and the two women stood staring at each other; there was a gleam of moisture in [MASK]’s eyes. “You weren’t so finical when it was the King I was playing him false with!”
<name>she</name>	she	Corinna	But slowly a resentment began to grow. When he had said it she had believed implicitly that he really meant he would see her no more if [MASK] found out. And yet he had broken one promise to his wife—why not others?
<name>Minerva</name>	Minerva	Barbara	[MASK] opened her mouth, her first impulse being to order him back—as she might once have done—and then she heard a snicker from somewhere nearby. Swiftly her eyes sought out the mocker, but all faces she met were veiled, innocently smiling.
<name>her granddaughter</name>	her granddaughter	Susanna	She spent hours with [MASK], helping her learn to walk, building block castles and playing with her, singing her the dozens of nursery rhymes she remembered from her own childhood. She adored her—but she could not build a whole life around her.
<name>Snape</name>	Snape	Charles	Because if you weren’t you wouldn’t allow yourself to be ruled by fools!” Heads turned, faces appeared at windows and then hastily retreated out of sight. All the Palace seemed suddenly to have grown quieter. “Govern your tongue!” snapped [MASK].
<name>please</name>	please	Almsbury	Then she looked up at him again. “Do you know where he is now?” “No.” Her eyes narrowed. “You’re lying. You do know! And you’ve got to tell me! Oh, [MASK]—please tell me!
<name>her nephew</name>	her nephew	Rose	Though she was paid the good wage of sixty pounds a year she spent it carelessly, entertaining friends who came to see her, buying brandy for her fat sodden mother and gifts for [MASK], tossing coins to every beggar who approached her in the streets.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Sarah	One of the women, pregnant herself, leant over the child, her eyes frightened and troubled—and then all at once the baby gasped, gave a sneeze, and opening its mouth began to yell. The women sighed, relieved. “[MASK]—” the midwife said softly.
<name>Artemis</name>	Artemis	Almsbury	I know what you are and I don’t care—so you’ll never hurt me very much either.” “Ye gods, [MASK]! Why should I want to hurt you—or anyone else? What the devil put that maggot into your head?”
<name>Cinderella</name>	Cinderella	Amber	[MASK]’s whole being filled with fierce buoyant pride. It was as though she stood in a blazing light and all the rest of the world in darkness, its eyes focused upon her. The King had sought her out, had flouted convention, had asked her to dance!
<name>King</name>	King	Charles	They fell to their knees, reaching out their hands toward him, sobbing, crying his name again and again. “God bless your Majesty!” “Long live the King!” [MASK] rode slowly, smiling, raising one hand to them in greeting.
<name>She</name>	She	Barbara	The maids were dismissed and they sat down alone, face to face, each taking the other’s measure. [MASK] knew at once that he had not changed his mind, as she had hoped he would, during that interval.
<name>Victoria</name>	Victoria	Lord	She could think of more reasons why the King had been too busy to see her than he could possibly have found himself. “Don’t be downcast, mam,” she would say. “[MASK], it takes up one’s time—being a king.”
<name>King</name>	King	Charles	The other men looked at one another sourly, annoyed that they must go walking in such weather, but the King strode along as unconcernedly as if it were a fine summer day. [MASK] walked in the Park because he liked the exercise and the fresh-air.
<name>She</name>	She	Amber	He raised his head quickly as she came in and their eyes met. [MASK] stood perfectly still, one arm braced against the doorjamb, staring at him. She felt her head begin to whirl and her heart to pound and she was suddenly paralyzed, unable to move or speak.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Gemini	“[MASK]! What else do you see? Will I have children?” “Let me see your palm again, madame. Yes, indeed, a very fair table—the line of riches well extended. The wheels of fortune are large. These intersparsings betoken children.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Amber	[MASK] leaned forward in her chair, holding tightly to her gloves with both hands, eyes narrowed and voice low and intense. “I came to tell you something. I came to tell you that whatever you may think—he loves me still.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Amber	His eyes had never seen her before. [MASK]’s throat swelled with pain and she wanted to cry: Love me again for just a minute, darling! Give me something happy to remember. Very softly she said: “I hope her Ladyship is recovered?”
<name>Mr. Stevens</name>	Mr. Stevens	Radclyffe	“You’re not thinking of going home, sir? Why, it’s still early. And her Ladyship’s the toast of the evening.” [MASK] bowed, his thin lips set in a tight ungracious smile. “By your leave, your Grace.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Amber	For a moment he looked at him without speaking. “Well?” demanded [MASK]. “How is he?” The doctor gave a faint shrug. “Madame, you ask me to answer the impossible. I do not know. Is there a bubo?”
