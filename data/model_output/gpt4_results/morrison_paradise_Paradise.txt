<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jeff	“My sister’s reputation is messed up, ain’t it?” “Uh huh. I can see that.” “Nothing can fix that, can it?” [MASK]’s question combined defiance and inquiry.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Connie	“What are you doing out here like that? Where’s [MASK]?” “Like what? She’s inside.” “You’re naked!” “Yeah. So? You want the cigar?” “Do they know?”
<name>She</name>	She	Pallas	He offered to follow her home in his Ford to make sure she didn’t stall out again. She didn’t and he waved goodbye. [MASK] brought him a present—an album—the next day and had trouble making him accept it.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Pat	and she was in the middle. Plus I am the one who washes sheets around here.” [MASK] stopped, put down her pen and, covering her eyes with her hand, tried to separate what she had seen from what she feared to see.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	David	A little? I want somebody not from around here. I hope five hundred is enough. I could go a little higher for a really intelligent girl. [MASK] will drive you back to the bus station, even if you decide not to take the job.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Harper	“All right, one of His houses. But whichever one, He demands respect from those who are in it. Am I right or am I right?” [MASK] sat down. “I apologize for the language. To Him,” he said, pointing upward.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Pat	Most of it anyway. Some of it is still aboveground, instructing their grandchildren in a level of intelligence their elders will never acquire. [MASK] sucked her teeth and pushed aside the Best file. She selected a composition notebook and without label or introduction continued to write.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Arnette	Don’t worry about that.” “I have to. I have to.” “It’s going to be all right now. [MASK]’s coming home.” “Turn the heater up. I’m so cold. How come I’m so cold?”
<name>McGarry</name>	McGarry	Deek	But since his profit depends on the sick and the dead, I’d just as soon he went bankrupt.” “[MASK]!” “Couldn’t do a damn thing for my boys. Buried in a bag like kittens.” “They had lovely coffins!
<name>Precious</name>	Precious	Pallas	I got to go.” “She got a hat on but no shoes. Okay, go ’head. See you tomorrow.” [MASK] straightened up, clutching her stomach, breathing hard through her mouth. “Listen to me. Clinic’s closing less you an emergency.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Soane	That was when [MASK] taught school—before she even noticed the singularity of the numbers. It was some time later that she saw there were only eight. By the time she understood that the Cato line was cut, there was another erasure. Who?
<name>she</name>	she	Consolata	The violent illness that followed she remembered as pleasant, because while she lay in the children’s ward a beautiful framed face watched her. It had lake-blue eyes, steady, clear but with a hint of panic behind them, a worry that [MASK] had never seen.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Seneca	“We don’t have much, but soap we do have.” “I said I’d wash them, didn’t I?” [MASK] wiped perspiration from under her chin. “Why don’t you roll up your sleeves?
<name>Sethe</name>	Sethe	Deek	What they saw was sometimes nothing, sometimes sad, and [MASK] remembered everything. Towns that looked like slave quarters, picked up and moved. Towns intoxicated with wealth. Other towns affecting sleep —squirreling away money, certificates, deeds in unpainted houses on unpaved streets.
<name>She</name>	She	Bennie	At those places [MASK] ate slowly, steadily, with repeat orders, side dishes and always something to go. She was careful with her money but didn’t seem worried about it, and shared the cost at every gas pump.
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Anna	“So what if the credit’s gone?” “It can’t be gone. We own the bank; the bank doesn’t own us.” “Aw, [MASK]. You don’t get it, do you? You don’t understand.”
<name>Rawlins</name>	Rawlins	Rector	Until twenty-nine days later. After being warned away by gunshot; offered food by some black women in a field; robbed of their rifles by two cowboys—none of which disturbed their determined peace —[MASK] and his father both saw him.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Deek	And what he does have has been there too long. That lounge chair changed colors three times sitting in the window.” “That’s why,” said [MASK]. “If he can’t move old inventory, he can’t buy new.”
<name>Thad</name>	Thad	Deek	“Brought three payments in the next day. Hope he can keep up the rest. Not enough hospital or mortuary business around here justify that overpriced buggy he got.” The coffee smell was starting, and [MASK] rubbed his palms. “Is he hurting?”
<name>Tense</name>	Tense	Vocal	He was silent, of course. But it was not the silence of the Friday noon pickups. Then the unspeaking was lush with promise. Easy. [MASK]. This silence was barren, a muteness lined with acid. And then she noticed the smell.
<name>She</name>	She	Mavis	Early Times didn’t help. The tears wet her chin, crept down her neck anyway. What it did eventually was knock her out. [MASK] woke felt-mouthed, ugly, unfocused, and knew she was ravenous because the sun, watermelon red, looked edible.
<name>Callahan</name>	Callahan	Deek	“What I want to know is what you going to do about it?” He shot his forefinger into the chair arm on the word “do.” [MASK] leaned back and spread his thighs wider, as though to welcome territory that naturally belonged to him.
<name>Obi</name>	Obi	Steward	[MASK] liked that story, but it unnerved him to know it was based on the defense of and prayers for a whore. He did not sympathize with the whitemen, but he could see their point, could even feel the adrenaline, imagining the fist was his own.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Pallas	California Christmases are always a treat and this one promised to be a marvel. Brilliant skies and heat turned up the gloss of artificial snow, plumped the green-and-gold, pink-and-silver wreaths. [MASK], laden with packages, just managed to avoid tripping off the down escalator.
<name>Miriam</name>	Miriam	Sweetie	[MASK] smiled but clearly didn’t enjoy his banter. Her eye was ever on her children. A slide. A lean. A suck of air—she bent over a crib and made quick, practiced adjustments. But her expression was mildly patroniz- ing as if to say what could there be to amuse her
<name>the woman</name>	the woman	Mavis	Tripping occasionally on gravel, she walked toward the diner. Inside, the waitress was eating crab cakes and grits behind the counter. She covered her plate with a cloth and touched the corners of her mouth before wishing [MASK] a good morning and taking her order.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Consolata	‘Tou can if you want to.” “What kind of help are you looking for?” “I can’t have this child.” Hot water splashed from the spout to the saucer. [MASK] put down the kettle and sopped the water with a towel.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Gigi	He had said “Convent,” so she thought sweet but stern women floating in sailboat hats above long black sleeves. But there was nobody, and the woman in the straw hat had disappeared. [MASK] walked through a marble foyer into another one, twice the size.
<name>Cholly</name>	Cholly	Gigi	• • 7J [MASK]. “But you free. The other one I charge,” he said, cutting his eyes away from the road. Pretending to examine the scenery through the passenger window, he looked at her navel first, then further down, then up.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Misner	Everybody pitched in. The bank idea was just a way of doing it. Families bought shares in it, you know, instead of just making deposits they could run through any old time. This way their money was safe.” [MASK] nodded and wiped his hands.
<name>Jacob</name>	Jacob	Menus	So the teenagers Misner organized who wanted to change it to “Be the Furrow of His Brow” were more insightful than they knew. Look what they did to [MASK], forcing him to give back or return the woman he brought home to marry.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Consolata	He looks at [MASK] and sees in her eyes what has been drained from them and from himself as well. There is blood near her lips. It takes his breath away. He lifts his hand to halt his brother’s and discovers who, between them, is the stronger man.
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Consolata	I came to thank you with all my heart.” She looked much the same to [MASK], except that the long hair of 1954, sticky with distress, was cut now. She carried a basket and placed it on the table.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Anna	“Still.” They were quiet for a moment, thinking about it. Then [MASK] walked around the counter and stood at the window. “You know, you right smart about weather. This is the third time I disbelieved you and was proved wrong.”
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Consolata	The Convent sold the nuts, and when pies from the harvest were made, they went as soon as posted. They made rhubarb pie so delicious it made customers babble, and the barbecue sauce got a heavenly reputation based on the hellfire peppers. It was an all-right life for [MASK].
<name>Emmeline</name>	Emmeline	Pallas	[MASK] waited on the church steps. There were no houses that she could see and no one was in the street. As the sun dipped, the air turned chilly. Only the soles of her feet, raw and burning, distracted her from the cold overtaking her marrow.
<name>Shep</name>	Shep	Ben	Her ears were soft in his fingers and he was steady with the camphor-soaked cotton. The ticks came away like coffee grounds. He put his palm under her jaw; she licked his chin. [MASK], the other collie, head on paws, looked on.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Sweetie	And [MASK]. And now the Oven site was on her mind. A few young men had taken to congregating there with 3.2 beer, people said, and the small children who liked to play there had been told to go home. Or so their mothers said.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Pallas	Only prison could be as blatant and as frightening, for beneath its rules and rituals scratched a life of gnawing violence. Those who came from peaceful well-regulated homes were overtaken by a cruelty that visited them as soon as they entered the gates. Cruelty decked out in juvenile glee. [MASK] tried.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Seneca	When the other rolled her eyes in disgust, [MASK] shot her an understanding look. Always the peacemaker. The one who said yes or I don’t mind or I’ll go. Otherwise—what? They might not like her. Might cry. Might leave.
<name>Effie</name>	Effie	Mavis	Later, in the afternoon, when she thought she would drop from exhaustion, they showed her to a bedroom with two cots. “Nap awhile,” said [MASK]. “I’ll call you when dinner’s ready. You like fried chicken?”
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Seneca	“We’ll take you,” said [MASK]. “I know where there’s a telephone. But you have to stop crying, hear?” They left then, stepping carefully through the darkness, eyes trained on the low light the candle flame shed.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Eddie	Not love. Not name it. Just feed it, play with it, then return it to its own habitat. She had five hundred dollars, and other than [MASK], no one knew where she was. Maybe she ought to keep it that way.
<name>Leon</name>	Leon	K.D.	“Halter? Looks like a starter to me.” “She the one [MASK] was messing with?” “Yep.” “I know that one there. She comes in the store. Who the other two?” “Beats me.” “Look.
<name>Jonas</name>	Jonas	Pallas	Then, in a softer voice, “Go on and get some sleep now. Stay as long as you like and tell me the rest when you want to.” [MASK] stood and wobbled a bit from the rocking and the wine. “Thanks. But.
<name>Malachi</name>	Malachi	Lone	“Finer than flour he’ll grind you.” “Say it, [MASK].” “Strike you in the moment of His choosing!” And sure enough, the masked figures wobble and collapse to the floor, while the seven families turn away.
<name>Henrietta</name>	Henrietta	July	There would be music by anyone: [MASK] on the upright piano; the Male Chorus; a Kate Golightly solo; the Holy Redeemer Quartet; a dreamy-eyed boy named Brood on the steps with a mouth organ.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Seneca	He really does. He’s really very sweet. He asked me to bring him a Bible.” “He’s sold it by now.” [MASK] looked away. The television screen flickered. On it, gravefaced men lied softly, courteously to each other.
<name>Laurel</name>	Laurel	Sargeant	The power is mine. Get used to it.’ ” “ ‘Be’ means you putting Him aside and you the power,” said [MASK]. “We are the power if we just—” “See what I mean? See what I mean?
<name>Arthur</name>	Arthur	Misner	It was inappropriate to smile at a funeral, so [MASK] envisioned the little girl whose destroyed hands he had once been permitted to hold. It helped him recover his line of thought. The questions he had asked in the mourners’ stead needed an answer.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Carlos	The pounds she had struggled with since elementary school melted away. [MASK] had never commented on her weight, but the fact that from the first, when she was a butterball, he liked her anyway—chose her, made love to her— sealed her confidence in him.
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Deek	[MASK] taps his shirt pocket where sunglasses are tucked. He had thought he might use them for other purposes, but he wonders if he needs them now to shield from his sight this sea of depravity beckoning below. None dares step on it.
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Seneca	“An artist.” “They all are, honey.” “Don’t tease her,” murmured [MASK]. “She’s had a long day.” “Okay, okay, okay. Good night. . .
<name>Alma</name>	Alma	Connie	“Go for miles and don’t see a speck of shade.” “True,” said [MASK]. She placed two cups of coffee and a pot of honey on the table. “Too much sunshine in the world. Vex me.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Haven	Except for marrying her mother, she couldn’t think what rule he had broken that made him so eager for the approval of those who disrespected him. He had described to her once what [MASK] looked like when he got out of the army.
<name>Seamus</name>	Seamus	Nathan	When the race finally got under way, the women yelled from the meadow, while their children shrieked and danced in grass up to their shoulders. The pony finished first, but since it lost its rider two furlongs out, the winner was [MASK]’s auburn mare.
<name>Telemachus</name>	Telemachus	K.D.	She stretched her legs out and lifted her feet to admire them, as she had done many times when she ran them up [MASK]’s spine while she lay in the loft and he sat with his naked back to her. She missed him, now and then.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	K.D.	But [MASK] was still messing around with one of the strays living out there where the entrance to hell is wide, and it was time to give him the news: every brothel don’t hang a red light in the window.
<name>Ellen</name>	Ellen	Carlos	If they had laughed behind her back before [MASK], if they had joked at her expense then, it came to her only as pale sensation: a broken gesture upon entering study hall; an eye slide as she turned away from her locker; an unstable smile as she joined a crowded lunch table.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	June	“I can’t think of any. I guess. I.” The photographer squatted, cocking his head as he examined the possibilities. “So some good can come out of this awful tragedy?” [MASK]’s smile was sad.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Consolata	[MASK] turns right and follows the sound of his tires and then their silence as they touch tarmac. He waits for her on the shoulder of the road. Inside the truck they look at one another for a long time, seriously, carefully, and then they smile.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Pallas	Better not to. Just say you was beat up or throwed out or something.” She smiled then, though her eyes were very grave. “Your hair’s full of algae.” She took off her hat and placed it on [MASK]’ head.
<name>Ennis</name>	Ennis	Mavis	“Like hell, like hell. Nobody’s fucked you in ten years, you dried-up husk.” “Get out!” [MASK] screamed, braking the car. “Get the hell out of my car!” “You gonna make me?
<name>Honey</name>	Honey	Deek	Instead she was moving resolutely north, where [MASK] knew there was nothing for seventeen miles. What could the sweetest girl, named for her nature, be doing coatless on a chilly October morning that far from the home she had not stepped out of since 1967?
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Rector	[MASK] sat up and looked around. The footsteps were thundering, but he couldn’t tell from which direction they came. As the hem of skylight widened, he could make out the silhouettes of tree trunks. They saw him at the same time.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Misner	His purity. To know that ‘what is sown is not alive until it dies.’” The wind picked up a bit but not enough to make anyone uncomfortable. [MASK] was losing them; they stood before the open grave closed to everything but their own musings.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Woman	“[MASK], listen to me. Those men got guns with sights on them.” “That doesn’t mean anything. I’ve never seen my brother go anywhere minus his rifle, except church, and even then it’s in the car.”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Seneca	I’m looking for some help.” She didn’t hold out her hand, but her smile made [MASK] want her to. “Can I talk to you about it?” The white linen blouse she wore was sleeveless, cut low. Her beige skirt was long.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mikey	Neither a high school nor a college student, no one, not even the other girls, took her seriousness seriously. If she hadn’t been able to print, no one would have known she was there. Except [MASK]. “Bastards,” she said aloud.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jean	The third day, she began to understand why [MASK] was gone and how to get her back. She cleaned her teeth and washed her ears carefully. She also flushed the toilet right away, as soon as she used it, and folded her socks inside her shoes.
<name>He</name>	He	Mavis	“Oh, lovely,” she said, coming to the table. “Just lovely.” She stuck her fingers into the bowl of pecans and gathered a few. [MASK] expected her to eat some, but she let them fall back to the heap.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Mavis	“Don’t need more’n a mosquito’s brain.” There were a few. A couple of tablespoons. [MASK] scraped them onto her plate wondering if there was to be any dessert. Quite a bit of the fried potatoes were still in her mother’s plate.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Mavis	The whiteness at the center was blinding. It took a moment for [MASK] to see the shape articulated among the pillows and the bone-white sheets, and she might have remained sightless longer had not an authoritative voice said, “Don’t stare, child.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Connie	But if a friend came by, her initial alarm at the sight of the young women might be muted by their adult manner; how calmly themselves they seemed. And [MASK]— how straight-backed and handsome she looked. How well that familiar dress became her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	K.D.	She was acquainted with it, had thought marrying [MASK] would permanently heal it, but now, waiting for “We are gathered here . . . ,” anxious for “Do you take this...” she knew better. Knew exactly what was and would always be missing.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Misner	That’s not a suggestion; that’s an order!” “Well, no. It’s not clear as daylight,” said [MASK]. “It says \ . . the Furrow of His Brow.’ There is no ‘Beware’ on it.”
<name>Tobasco</name>	Tobasco	Convent	Now the difficulty that loomed in 1949 had been solved by tobacco. It didn’t matter whether her peas were garden fresh or canned. [MASK] peppers, hot as hellfire, did all the cooking for her. The trouble it took to cultivate peas was wasted.
<name>Esther</name>	Esther	Richard	We have to come up with something, [MASK]. Something more than choir competitions and Bible class and ribbons for fat vegetables and baby showers. . .” “What about her?” “Oh, I don’t know.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mavis	Later, watching her suddenly beautiful hands moving at the task, [MASK] was reminded of her sixth-grade teacher opening a book: lifting the corner of the binding, stroking the edge to touch the bookmark, caressing the page, letting the tips of her fingers trail down the lines of print.
<name>John</name>	John	Richard	The contentment she drew from [MASK]’s fire made her smile. But she couldn’t be a minister’s wife. Never. Could she? Well, he had not asked her to be one —so enjoy the stove heat, the nape of his neck and the invisible presence of kittens.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Sally	“No, thanks. You serve gravy with the biscuits?” “Sure do. Poured or on the side?” “On the side, please.” “Sure thing. And you?” She turned to [MASK]. “Just coffee.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mavis	[MASK] lingered, amazed by the unnatural brightness of the green. What she thought were military students turned out to be real soldiers—but young, so young, and as fresh-looking as the headstones they stood before.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Zechariah	“You can’t start it and you can’t stop it. And another thing: He’s not going to do your work for you, so step lively.” If the loud footsteps continued, they did not hear them. Nobody saw the walking man but [MASK] and sometimes a child.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Zechariah	“He is with us,” said [MASK]. “He is leading the way.” From then on, the journey was purposeful, free of the slightest complaints. Every now and then the walking man reappeared: along a riverbed, at the crest of a hill, leaning against a rock formation.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Pallas	All the girls went creamy over him. The day he pressed the accelerator to the floor, telling [MASK] her gas line was flooded, was the beginning. He offered to follow her home in his Ford to make sure she didn’t stall out again. She didn’t
<name>She</name>	She	Jean	After that she was unexpectedly distracted in malls, theater ticket lines, buses. In 1968 she was certain she spotted her at a Little Richard concert, but the press of the crowd prevented a closer look. [MASK] was discreet about this subversive search.
<name>Ada</name>	Ada	Pallas	The receptionist looked at her with unwholesome curiosity but didn’t say anything. It was threatening to get dark when two men came in, one with a partially severed hand. [MASK] and the sleeping mother were yet to be attended to, but the man seeping blood into a towel took precedence.
<name>Marisol</name>	Marisol	Gigi	[MASK] was released from the emergency room with an Ace bandage on her wrist. Everything happened so fast they had no time to plan where to meet. The court-appointed lawyer came out saying no bail, no probation. His client had to do the whole three months.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Pallas	“Get in back, then,” said the woman. [MASK] climbed among the males—her age mostly—and sat as far away from them as she could, praying that the woman was their mother sister aunt—or any restraining influence.
<name>Junior</name>	Junior	K.D.	So bad he never let their only son forget it. Then there was [MASK], the family man. Talking about how strange one of those Convent girls was and how he knew it right away soon as he saw her get off the bus. Ha ha.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Seneca	“Sure. I mean. Sure.” [MASK] scooted over to make room on the bench, but he did not sit down. “I’m authorized to offer you five hundred dollars for some complicated but quite easy work, if you’re interested.”
<name>She</name>	She	Soane	«T >I yy 1 can t. “They wouldn’t hurt them, would they?” [MASK] cut off the wipers. There was no need for them now. “No,” she answered. “Just scare them. Into leaving, I mean.”
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Soane	[MASK] noticed two things: the basket was empty but the lady carried it with two hands as though it were full, which, as she knew now, was a sign of what was to come—an emptiness that would weigh her down, an absence too heavy to carry.
<name>She</name>	She	Gigi	Lukewarm and shallow, the tub water rose only to her waist. [MASK] liked it deep, hot, heavy with bubbles. The plumbing in the mansion was breaking up: producing colored water, heaving and sometimes failing to rise to the second floor.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	K.D.	He said his name was [MASK] and tried hard to enjoy her face as much as her cleavage while he talked. It was a struggle she expected, rose to and took pleasure in — normally. But the picture she had wakened to an hour earlier spoiled it.
<name>Francie</name>	Francie	Gigi	“A bit. Funeral foods. But now I’ll cook fresh.” “There’s plenty,” said [MASK]. “We haven’t even touched the — ” “You put some clothes on!” “You kiss my ass!”
<name>Selina</name>	Selina	Dusty	During the wait, in which no car or truck or bus approached, she dozed, woke to awful thoughts, dozed again. Suddenly she sat up, wide awake, and decided not to starve. Would the road girls just sit there? Would [MASK]?
<name>Martha</name>	Martha	Consolata	She touches the diaper to see if a change is needed. Something. Something. [MASK] goes chill. Opening the door she hears retreating steps too heavy, too many for a woman. She considers whether or not to disturb the baby’s sleep.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Richard	Not because he was ashamed of his twin, but because the shame was in himself. It scared him. So he went off and never spoke to his brother again. Not one word. Know what I mean?” “It must have been hard,” said [MASK].
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Seneca	They listened carefully to details of friends and family not there; had advice and instruction for every piece of domestic news. They seemed terribly manly to [MASK] — leaderlike in their management of the visit. From where to sit, where to put the paper wrappings, to medical advice and books to send.
