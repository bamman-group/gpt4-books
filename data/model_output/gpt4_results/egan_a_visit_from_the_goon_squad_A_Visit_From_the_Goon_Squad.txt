<name>Jonah</name>	Jonah	Rolph	[MASK] pulls at his sister’s shoulder. He wants her to remember, to feel it all again: the wind, the endless black ocean, the two of them peering into the dark as if awaiting a signal from their distant, grown-up lives.
<name>Carla</name>	Carla	Sasha	At which point [MASK] explained step 2: each of you had to tell the other something that would make it impossible for you ever to really go out. “Have you done this before?” you asked, incredulous.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rhea	In 1979, that could be the beginning of an exciting story, a story where anything might happen. Now it’s a punch line. “It was all for no reason,” I say. “That’s never true,” [MASK] says.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Kitty	I’m feeling kind of dreamy. I’m looking at [MASK]’s legs as we walk (as much as I can without crawling beside her on the ground—a thought that crosses my mind) and discovering that above the knee they are flecked with hairs of finest gold.
<name>Benny</name>	Benny	Bix	And right then you feel it—what you’ve seen in people’s faces on the street—a swell of movement, like an undertow, rushing you toward something you can’t quite see. “Oh, we’ll know each other forever,” [MASK] says.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Scotty	“Call this man,” I said. “He runs a record label. Tell him [MASK] sent you.” They both looked at the card, squinting in the angled sunlight. “Call him,” I said. “He’s my buddy.”
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bennie	Driving again, [MASK] forced himself to ask his son, “So, boss. What did you think?” The kid didn’t answer. Maybe he was pretending not to hear, or maybe the wind was too loud in his face.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sasha	He rarely thought of [MASK] as an independent person, and beyond a vague awareness of boyfriends coming and going (vague first out of respect for her privacy, lately out of indifference), he knew few specifics of her life.
<name>Anna</name>	Anna	Charlie	“How old are you?” He hugs her to him. When [MASK] was little he did this all the time, but as she grows older it happens less. Her father is warm, almost hot, his heartbeat like someone banging on a heavy door.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Bosco	“The bottom line is, no one cares that your life has gone to hell, [MASK]. It’s a joke that you think this is interesting. If you were still a rock star, it might be, but you aren’t a rock star—you’re a relic.”
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Rebecca	“One time, okay?” But his heart was racing. ‘You just changed the rules, all by yourself?” “I didn’t change them, I slipped. Okay? Am I allowed to have one goddamn slip?” [MASK] raised an eyebrow.
<name>She</name>	She	Sasha	He was sliding into the city’s knotty entrails, a poor, un-touristed area where the sound of flapping laundry mingled with the bristly chatter of pigeons’ wings. Without warning, [MASK] pivoted around to face him. She stared, bewildered, into his face.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Alex	From the street, a single cough, errant conversational strands: . . you’re asking me to be a different per- son . . and “Believe it or not, drinking keeps me clean.” [MASK] leaned against his cushion and lit up a joint.
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Bennie	Plus they’d written decent songs; hell, they’d sold twelve thousand CDs off the stage before [MASK] ever heard them play. A little time to develop potential singles, some clever marketing, and a decent video could put them over the top.
<name>Callie</name>	Callie	Jocelyn	One night her mom made us hot chocolate and brought it into the living room on a gold tray. She had big tired eyes and tendons moving in her neck. [MASK] whispered in my ear, Rich people like to hostess, so they can show off their nice stuff.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Jocelyn	This fragile new sun in our arms. Every night, my mother ticks off another day I’ve been clean. It’s more than a year, my longest yet. “[MASK], you’ve got so much life in front of you,” she says.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lulu	[MASK] took the dusty, unwashed fruit, wiped it carefully on her short-sleeved polo shirt, and sank her teeth into its bright green rind. Juice sprayed her collar. She laughed and wiped her mouth on her hand.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Bennie	There was a picture of [MASK] receiving some kind of award, looking out of breath and a little cross-eyed—one of those frozen, hectic instants you just know has a whole happy life attached. I looked at the picture for less than a second; then I closed the magazine.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bennie	“I think so,” she said, the act of lying to her husband’s face bringing on a tingly vertigo. ‘You’re right, though. It’s weird.” “It’s scary,” [MASK] said.
<name>Uncle</name>	Uncle	Ted	“Go away,” she said. “I’m busy.” [MASK] moved nearer the door, flattening his palm against the splintery wood. Across it, he felt the spooked, angry presence of his niece. “So this is where you live,” he said.
<name>David</name>	David	Rolph	At eleven years old, [MASK] knows two clear things about himself: He belongs to his father. And his father belongs to him. They stand still, surrounded by the whispering bush. The sky is crammed with stars.
<name>Jessica</name>	Jessica	Sasha	The minute you walk in, the Nirvana volume drops and the windows fly open. You now seem to be in the same category as a professor or a cop: you make people instantly nervous. There’s got to be a way to enjoy this. You follow [MASK] into her room.
<name>Lolita</name>	Lolita	Kitty	Let us return to the moment: one hand covering [MASK]’s mouth and doing its best to anchor her rather spirited head, the other fumbling with my zipper, which I’m having some trouble depressing, possibly because of the writhing motions of my subject beneath me.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Lou	When the waiter brings my linguine and clams I can’t take one bite. Only [MASK] eats: an almost-raw steak, a Caesar salad, red wine. He’s one of those people who never stops moving.
<name>Clary</name>	Clary	Ted	[MASK] let go of her arms, and she folded them in her lap. “I thought he could keep track of me because of my hair. But now it isn’t even red.” “I recognized you.” “True.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lulu	[MASK] looked askance at her mother, still in yesterday’s clothes, and said, “It’s time to go.” “You’re going to school?” “Of course I’m going to school. What else would I do?” They took the subway.
<name>Emilia</name>	Emilia	Alice	We head downstairs and outside into [MASK]’s backyard, where I’ve only been in the dark. It’s sunny now, with flowers in patterns and a tree with lemons on it. At the edge of the yard, two little girls are slapping a bright yellow ball around a silver pole.
<name>He</name>	He	Alex	Was it possible that his daughter could feel the vibrations through his body? “Mine lolli-pop!” [MASK] wasn’t sure how she’d arrived at this name for the handset, but he certainly wasn’t correcting her. “What do you want, honeybunch?”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Bennie	The problem was precision, perfection; the problem was digitization, which sucked the life out of everything that got smeared through its microscopic mesh. Film, photography, music: dead. An aesthetic holocaust! [MASK] knew better than to say this stuff aloud.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Alfred	“What do you want from me, [MASK]? Can we have a conversation?” “We lost.” “So you’re what, five and eight?” “Four and nine.” “Well. There’s time.”
<name>Jeremiah</name>	Jeremiah	Lou	When I look at my mother she gives me a smile, each time. But exhaustion has carved up her face. The silence takes on a kind of intelligence, and we see [MASK] watching us. His eyes are so vacant, I think he might be dead.
<name>Chad</name>	Chad	Alice	I knew instantly that it had been the right move to bring up [MASK]. I’d said something literally, yes, but underneath that I’d said something else: we were both a couple of asswipes, and now only I’m an asswipe; why?
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Stephanie	But [MASK] had no intention of quitting. If they were going to live in a place whose social life revolved around a country club, she sure as hell was going to stay on good terms with the woman who guaranteed her easy assimilation.
<name>Mara</name>	Mara	Dolly	The hidden camera was ready in [MASK]’s purse. As they climbed the steps, she took out the activator and nestled it in her palm. At the top of the stairs the jungle had been cleared away to accommodate a slab of concrete that might have been a landing pad.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Ted	He passed churches blistered with grime, moldering palazzi whose squalid interiors leaked sounds of wailing cats and children. Soiled, forgotten coats of arms were carved above their massive doorways, and these unsettled [MASK]: such universal, defining symbols made meaningless by nothing more than time.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Lou	The TV is new, flat and long, and its basketball game has a nervous sharpness that makes the room and even us look smudged. A guy comes in dressed in black, a diamond in his ear, and he fiddles with [MASK]’s tubes and takes his blood pressure.
<name>Blackjack</name>	Blackjack	Nixon	I have an urge to push her backward onto the grass, and I do. “Hey!” my subject cries, her voice muffled and startled but not yet frightened, exactly. “Pretend you’re riding [MASK],” I say. “HEY!”
<name>Franny</name>	Franny	Kitty	“Oh, [MASK],” I say. “Forget the movie. We’re out here in the park, it’s a gorgeous day. Let’s leave those other two people behind us. Let’s talk about. . . about horses.”
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Kitty	While all this is happening, I’m taking in [MASK]’s legs, which are long, considering her modest height, as well as brown, and not that orangey brown of tanning salons, but a rich, tawny chestnut that makes me think of—well, of horses.
<name>Clive</name>	Clive	Bennie	“I don’t want to hear the mix.” He felt shaken, soiled. [MASK] dropped artists all the time, sometimes three in a week, but now his own shame tinged the Stop/Go sisters’ failure, as if he were to blame.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sasha	But he’d let her go, and she was gone. “Are you there?” [MASK] called, but he didn’t answer. She threw open the door and peered out. “You are,” she said, with relief.
<name>Tracy</name>	Tracy	Rolph	“You see them much?” “Some,” he says, in his strangled new voice. He had six, from three marriages he bored through and then kicked away. [MASK], the second oldest, was his favorite.
<name>Emmett</name>	Emmett	Scotty	Everyone gathers around, there’s no way not to when [MASK] plays. One time the entire J.V. soccer team climbed up from the athletic field to listen, looking around in their jerseys and long red socks like they didn’t know how they got there.
<name>Marlon</name>	Marlon	Charlie	“I wonder what will happen to the cubs,” he says. “The lioness who got shot must have been their mom—she was eating with them.” “Not necessarily,” [MASK] says. “But if she was.. .”
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Rhea	Through the sheet, [MASK] is touching his chest. It’s a bad day. The sun hurts my head. “I should kill you,” I say, looking at him straight. “You deserve to die.”
<name>Adam</name>	Adam	Lou	Rage at this man who casts everyone aside. “They are not—” He can’t make himself repeat the word. “They are,” [MASK] says tightly. “Pretty soon you’ll know it for sure.”
<name>He</name>	He	Ted	(I lose, read one, in the broken English of the hotel clerk). [MASK] left them where he’d thrown them. He showered, dressed without shaving, drained a vodka at the minibar, and removed cash and another credit card from his room safe.
<name>Amelia</name>	Amelia	Sasha	You slip through [MASK]’s open window, floating over the sill lined with artifacts from her travels: a white seashell, a small gold pagoda, a pair of red dice. Her harp in one corner with its small wood stool.
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Kitty	I want children. That’s why, in this new movie, I bond so strongly with my surrogate mother. . .” But my Pavlovian efforts to suppress the PR component of our lunch have succeeded, and [MASK] falls silent.
<name>James</name>	James	Lou	Out of view, near the kitchen, are some smaller tents for the staff, and then the black, muttering expanse of the bush, where they’ve been cautioned never to go. ‘Your sister’s acting nuts,” [MASK] says, striding into the dark.
<name>Griffin</name>	Griffin	Albert	[MASK] has gained the status of a hero, but you wouldn’t know it to look at him. He gulps a bourbon and mutters his responses to the giddy queries of the Phoenix Faction. No one has yet confronted him on the damning basics: Why were you in the bush?
<name>Switters</name>	Switters	Lou	[MASK]’s eyes are shut, and he snores. The stylish nurse-butler checks his wristwatch and leaves. So this is it—what cost me all that time. A man who turned out to be old, a house that turned out to be empty.
<name>James</name>	James	Bennie	The sisters were screaming, the tiny room imploding from their sound, and [MASK] tried to find again the deep contentment he’d felt just a minute ago. But “hairball” had unsettled him. The room felt uncomfortably small.
<name>second</name>	second	Scotty	Where we live, in the Sunset, the ocean is always just over your shoulder and the houses have Easter-egg colors. But the second [MASK] lets the garage door slam down, we’re suddenly enraged, all of us.
<name>Jason</name>	Jason	Rob	He’s primordially cute, with reddish face stubble and nice more eyes, like a mountain climber. handsome. L_< L_J If you look - -v \ carefully, you “Did you r a A “Why can tell that [MASK] love him?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ted	A whisper of silvery birds. This must have been the ballroom. On the third floor [MASK] noticed two boys sharing a cigarette in a doorway. Another lay asleep under a straggling assortment of laundry: wet socks and underwear pinned carefully to a wire.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Lulu	“They seemed nice at first, but that was all an act. The outright horrible ones, the ones who basically wanted to kill you—at least they were being honest.” [MASK] nodded, as if this were a problem she’d dealt with herself.
<name>Bosco</name>	Bosco	Jules	This is reality, right? You don’t look good anymore twenty years later, especially when you’ve had half your guts removed. Time’s a goon, right? Isn’t that the expression?” [MASK] had drifted over from across the room.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Sasha	And he’ll say, That? I’ve never seen it before—it must be yours, [MASK]. And maybe that’s true. Maybe someone gave it to me years ago, and I forgot. “And did you? Put it back?”
<name>Peeta</name>	Peeta	Lou	and then he shakes, flailing between my legs, jerking as the life goes out of him. When he’s absolutely still, I let him float to the top. I open my eyes. No one has moved. [MASK] is still crying, searching the pool with his blank eyes.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bennie	“I told you.” “It looks like gold. Flakes of gold.” “It has a flaky consistency.” “Can I taste one?” “Son. You don’t—” “Just one?” [MASK] sighed. “One.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Bosco	The memory mooned her as she rang [MASK]’s bell and waited, praying silently: Please don’t be home please don’t answer please. Then at least the charade part of the day would be over. No voice on the intercom, just a buzz.
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Arc	There shouldn’t be a goddamned bow under the general’s chin.” “He will no longer wear this hat.” “He has to wear the hat.” “He will not wear it. He refuses.” “Cut off the ties, [MASK].”
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Noreen	[MASK]. Through the fence.” “Wouldn’t surprise me.” “You just let that go on?” “What can we do? She’s not hurting us. She’s not even on our property.” “She could be dangerous.”
<name>Trout</name>	Trout	Bennie	I stood just inside the door, holding my fish. [MASK] went around to the other side of the wet black oval of his desk. It looked frictionless, like you could slide a coin over the surface and it would float to the edge and drop to the floor.
<name>Michael</name>	Michael	Ted	“I’d like to,” [MASK] said. “Believe me.” But he couldn’t bring himself to leave, or even really move. He stood until his legs began to ache, then bent his knees and slid to the floor.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jules	[MASK] put his arm around her. “If you’d asked me this morning, I would have said we were finished,” he said. “All of us, the whole country—the fucking world. But now I feel the opposite.”
<name>Lupe</name>	Lupe	Jocelyn	That’s factually crazy, I go, and my face is getting hot. He has a Mohawk. And he’s not even friends with them. [MASK] goes, Not all cholos are friends. Then she says, The good news is, rich girls won’t go with cholos.
<name>Camille</name>	Camille	Sasha	[MASK] opened her purse, took out the wallet, unearthed her vial of Xanax, and popped one between her teeth. They worked faster if you chewed them. As the caustic taste flooded her mouth, she scanned the room, trying to decide where to ditch the wallet:
<name>Eliza</name>	Eliza	Kitty	By now I’m bellowing and honking like a besieged buffalo, and [MASK] is running away, her tawny limbs no doubt dappled with light falling through the trees, though I’m too distressed even to look. I think I’d have to call that the end of our lunch.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Rhea	So this is it—what cost me all that time. A man who turned out to be old, a house that turned out to be empty. I can’t help it, I start to cry. [MASK] puts her arms around me.
<name>Lee</name>	Lee	Rolph	“What do you think?” “She likes to read. She brought a lot of books.” “Did she.” “I like her,” [MASK] says. “But I don’t know if she’s crazy. Or what the right amount is.”
<name>Enoch</name>	Enoch	Alex	The guy pictured on that page— long-haired, jaunty, grinning a mouthful of porcelain and surrounded by a lot of big colorful balls—caused an itch of aggravation in [MASK] every time he looked at him. wat nxt?
<name>Amara</name>	Amara	Kitty	“Oops!” she said loudly, in mock surprise. “Was I not supposed to bring up the genocide?” Here was a word the general knew. He flung himself away from [MASK] as if she were on fire, commanding his solders in a strangled voice.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Jocelyn	He doesn’t go, Hey beautiful, though. He goes, I told you to let me call you. [MASK] goes. Sorry, in an empty little voice. I grab the phone and go, What kind of hello is that?
<name>David</name>	David	Sasha	[MASK] had asked. It seemed like a weird thing for a therapist to admit. “I find it tiring,” he’d said. “This way, we can both look where we want.” “Where will you look?” He smiled.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Sasha	“I would miss [MASK],” he says slowly. “Wouldn’t you?” “You don’t really know her,” you say, breathless, a little desperate. ‘You don’t know who you’d be missing.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bennie	[MASK] did this now, scribbling incompetent on the back of a parking ticket he’d received the day before. Then, recalling the earlier humiliation, he added to the list kissing Mother Superior. “So, boss,” he said. “Whatcha feel like doing?”
<name>Macmillan</name>	Macmillan	Sasha	Hope [MASK] took good care of you.” He gestured at the girl I’d been dealing with, whose carefree smile could be roughly translated as: He’s officially not my problem anymore. I gave her a wink whose exact translation was: Don’t be so sure, darling.
<name>Robert</name>	Robert	Bennie	The old fear rose in her so quickly, like a hand at her throat, despite [MASK]’s promise two years ago, when he turned forty, and the fact that she had no reason to doubt him. “You seem, I don’t know.
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Sasha	“Of course not.” “So ... I tell you I used to torture kitty cats, and that stops you from wanting to jump my bones?” “Did you?” “Fuck, no.” “I’ll go first,” [MASK] said.
<name>Sasha</name>	Sasha	Sasha	It began the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel. [MASK] was adjusting her yellow eye shadow in the mirror when she noticed a bag on the floor beside the sink that must have belonged to the woman whose peeing she could faintly hear through the vaultlike door of a toilet stall.
<name>Tim</name>	Tim	Drew	You’re moving fast, and when you look for [MASK] you can’t find him. The shore is far away. A person is swimming near it, but at such a distance that when the swimmer pauses, waving frantic arms, you can’t see who it is.
<name>Chet</name>	Chet	Zeus	“A lap steel guitar with a slide— you ever heard one live? And we’re not even talking rockabilly.” [MASK] worked for a blood bank and, in his spare time, helped Down syndrome kids make and sell printed sweatshirts.
<name>Jill</name>	Jill	Lulu	“Oh, sure,” [MASK] said. “BTs—blind teams—work especially well with older people. I mean”— she smiled—“people over thirty.” “And why is that?” “Older people are more resistant to ...” She seemed to falter.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Bosco	They were young and lucky and strong—what did they have to worry about? If they didn’t like the result, they could go back and start again. And now [MASK] was sick, hardly able to move, feverishly planning his death.
<name>Chuckles</name>	Chuckles	Benjo	I kept my eyes on the building as I dropped the letter into the mailbox directly in front of it. Hey [MASK], I’d written (that was what I used to call him). Long time no see. I hear you’re the man, now.
<name>Chia</name>	Chia	Lulu	“BTs—blind teams—work especially well with older people. I mean”— she smiled—“people over thirty.” “And why is that?” “Older people are more resistant to ...” She seemed to falter. “Being bought?” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Marco</name>	Marco	Drew	You don’t believe it’s happening at first; off comes his jacket, his sweater, his two T-shirts and undershirt. And there is [MASK]’s bare torso, strong and tight as you’d imagined, though thinner, the dark hair on his chest in the shape of a spade.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Kitty	But a sardonic expression had taken up residence in her face, as if those blue eyes were rolling heavenward even as they gazed right at you. That look, more than the first spidery lines under [MASK]’s eyes and alongside her mouth, made her seem no longer young, or even close.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Alex	Look,” she said, straightening her spine and flicking her rather grave (despite the friendly antics of her face) gray eyes at [MASK], “if I believe, I believe. Who are you to judge my reasons?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mindy	The sound seems to travel out his window and back in through [MASK]’s, like one of those whispering tubes. ‘You must know that.” “I didn’t,” she murmurs back. “Well, you are.” “My hands are tied.”
<name>August</name>	August	Marty	But I’m worried he might think the same of me, so I don’t smile back. [MASK] plugs in his violin and we launch into our best song, “What the Fuck?”: You said you were a fairy princess You said you were a shooting star
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Jules	“This is who we’re going to see?” “We? I thought you were hitching a ride.” “Can I come with you?” [MASK] asked. “Please?” He sounded humble and plaintive: a man with nowhere to go and nothing to do.
<name>Danny</name>	Danny	Lou	We were smooth, both of us. “Where’s that. Thing,” [MASK] asks, meaning the button pad to tilt the bed. He wants to sit up and look out like he used to, in his red bathing suit, tanned legs smelling of chlorine.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Bennie	The Mother Superior leaned forward slightly, tilting her head in a way that must have triggered something in [MASK], because he lurched across the sill and kissed her on the mouth: velvety skin-fuzz, an intimate, baby powder smell in the half second before the nun cried out and jerked away.
<name>Ratner</name>	Ratner	Alex	[MASK] didn’t know. He didn’t need to know. What he needed was to find fifty more people like him, who had stopped being themselves without realizing it. “Physics is required. Three semesters. If you fail, you’re out of the program.”
<name>Margot</name>	Margot	Kathy	[MASK] was carrying a tennis racket. She wore a tiny white dress beneath which white tennis shorts, hardly more than underpants, were just visible. Her prodigious childbearing had left no mark on her narrow waist and well-tanned biceps.
<name>Marcel</name>	Marcel	Chronos	Movement comes from a direction no one is expecting: the female gnawing at the zebra. She vaults at [MASK] in an agile, gravity-defying spring that anyone with a house cat would recognize. She lands on his head, flattening him instantly.
<name>Garlic</name>	Garlic	Vinegar	I asked. “Not at all.” He didn’t sound afraid, but I smelled that he was. [MASK]: that’s what fear smells like. I went to the window. I pretended to look at the view, but my eyes were closed.
