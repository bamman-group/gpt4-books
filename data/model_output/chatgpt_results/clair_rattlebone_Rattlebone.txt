<name>Maureen</name>	Maureen	Geraldine	Despite linoleum and rugs, the room felt damp. [MASK] pulled the fine chain of the light above one of the sleeping areas and turned back the screen. “Here’s my skirt I told you about.” She pointed to the open door of her chifforobe.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Lyddy	Come next fall guess what house ain’t going to be on the list?” “[MASK], there’s always somebody looking for a place to stay. ” “Go on back to sleep,” I said. “See how you feel in the morning. ”
<name>George</name>	George	Thomas	“Do me a favor, why don’t you. Fold up the bed and sit down while I get myself together.” [MASK] folds the bed into a sofa, but instead of sitting, he walks around, absently touching things.
<name>Summer</name>	Summer	Easter	Besides, I reasoned, my father had to be at work long before I had to be at school; it could not be him. At about this time, school seemed pointless. [MASK] came and went and not even my new linen pleated skirt could cheer me.
<name>it</name>	it	Pemberton	I never knew much about the woman except she had some children already, didn’t have no man, and she was sure [MASK] was going to belong to her. Oh, she had a nerve. Come walking by any time of day she felt like it.
<name>Marion</name>	Marion	Appeal	It’s too cold out here.” [MASK] moved toward alarm. I dismissed the fantasy of seeing the truck in the alley behind her house and went quickly with her up to her attic bedroom. “Sit down,” she said. I sat down.
<name>Elvis</name>	Elvis	Shorty	We were sure to have a car before we got another truck. People I had never seen before recognized me on the bus. “You must be [MASK]’s daughter, I can see it in your face,” they’d say.
<name>she</name>	she	Wanda	She unbuttoned my car coat for me and touched her fingers to my cheek. “Too cold for you to be out with nothing on,” she said. “Sit down and eat.” I obeyed. Days later, [MASK] broached the subject again.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Reenie	I could hardly stand still for the torture in my chest. “Girl, you better sit down now, this is between me and your daddy.” She looked at him for support. He said weakly, “Sit down, [MASK].
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Thomas	Behind her, [MASK] shuffles along, overcoat hanging on his arm. He climbs into the driver’s side and fishtails his dated Buick down the street. Eventually he slows down. “What you so mad about?”
<name>Melinda</name>	Melinda	Dorla	In the halls she glided along close to the walls with her head up and eyes straining forward as though something in the distance had caught her attention. And if you said anything to her, she looked down. Every day in homeroom I made a point of saying, “Hi, [MASK].”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Wilson	“[MASK], from the cleaners, right?” We were fast becoming “established,” and for a change nothing stood in our way. I could imagine myself waving college brochures with the best of them at school.
<name>himself</name>	himself	Wanda	Still, if the truth be known, he would give this girl-of-a-woman anything that was his to give. And what was love if it wasn’t a new chance for him, a new time for [MASK], maybe for her brother too?
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Dogs	[MASK], all of them. Forget him. You have to tell yourself nothing happened. Nothing at all happened. After all,” she said, “I’m the only one at school who knows the whole story, and I know how to keep it to myself.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Lydia	This was not the kind of thing he enjoyed about Christmas. In the old days, when their rooming house had been full of people, he and [MASK] had concentrated on the real meaning of the season, restricted celebrations to dinners and whatever the church designed.
<name>Wilfred</name>	Wilfred	Set	His proud heart. Contrition offered to the lowliest of low-lies. How often has he himself said that? This looks sadly like the end of the line with no bus back. He never planned to do anything. He was old. [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Thomas	People find their own seats. Second Sunday. [MASK] sits still through the first anthem. Another begins. If he moves his things—hymnal, notepad, Bible—from beside his chair and onto his lap, he might call attention to himself.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Summer	[MASK] was coming when he would show me which was dandelion and which was dock, which was pokeberry and which was nettle. We would bring back morels and truffles for my mother to dip in egg and crackers and fry them crispy brown.
<name>Scout</name>	Scout	Wanda	“Stay here, [MASK]. Everybody’s going to be looking, you know that. Why you need to see who they are? Why they need to see you? You don’t belong to the church, so they can’t do nothing to you.”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Nick	my mother asked him. “I know your mamma left something for you to get done ’fore she gets home,” she said. “I bet you haven’t even washed your face yet.” “I already did everything,” [MASK] lied.
<name>Joey</name>	Joey	Janice	my mother asked. “I was up by [MASK]’s house,” I told her. That night the tinge of pink in my underpants said that I should put epsom salts in the bathtub and hope that nothing bad had happened down there.
<name>Angelica</name>	Angelica	Puddin	Desire, however, is sometimes the affectionate face of envy, and in the next moment I tried to imagine what might mar those flawless features that nobody could resist. I never dreamed that a day or two later the ever-so-calm Wanda would be frantic about [MASK].
<name>applicant</name>	applicant	Irene	“Tell us, [MASK], in your own words, why do you think you should have this scholarship?” I had written what I considered an outstanding paragraph about why I wanted to go to college, but looking into their expectant faces, I couldn’t remember a word of it.
<name>Pecola</name>	Pecola	Wilsons	Every last one of them.” “That’s just like us. All of us are [MASK].” “In this house,” my mother said. “Not in the whole city. Don’t make no sense one man having so many women.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Wanda	Back downstairs she stacked two sheets, a pillowcase, and a chenille bedspread on my arms. “Take these up there and make up the bed.” While I tucked sheets and searched for some firm principle to stand on, I heard [MASK]’s knock.
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Junie	Splurging, I figured, because winter was dull and prosperity had knocked on our door. After the pork chops and before the hand-packed Velvet Freeze with chocolate sauce, [MASK] asked, “Why are we having all this?”
<name>Daddy</name>	Daddy	Irene	“You can’t do that!” I said. “Don’t try me, [MASK]. Get your hind parts out of that truck.” Given my opinion on how little my mother knew about love, I was furious.
<name>who</name>	who	Wanda	And that I was the one who had made the bed upstairs where he must lie. It was as if he had given me some precious thing of his for all my fourteen years and now he was taking it back. Again i couldn’t see telling [MASK].
<name>Juniper</name>	Juniper	Puddin	Our visitor folded her paper dolls and easel, the felt earth and starry sky, and said it was time for her to go. As she pulled away from our curb, we all tagged each other and split up in homeward directions. Except for [MASK].
<name>Maggie</name>	Maggie	Bea	Sometimes I’d get to school and have to wait an hour for the doors to open. “Where you going so early?” she’d ask as she combed [MASK]’s hair. “I’ve got to get a book from the library.”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Pemberton	But [MASK], he was the one acted a pure-D-fool. Friday night I fixed him some greens, baked a whole ham, candied up some sweet potatoes, and cut up a little onion and tomato like he likes.
<name>Mrs. Dubose</name>	Mrs. Dubose	Nick	In the kitchen, I took the box of matches from the shelf over the stove and crept out the screen door. The glider creaked, but I stole out of the yard across the alley, through [MASK]’s yard, out to the sidewalk and on.
<name>Mr. Henry</name>	Mr. Henry	Dele	She watched me, though. By the way I washed and braided my hair late Friday nights to get up straightening it early Saturdays before [MASK] came with the eggs, she knew. She knew by the school clothes I put on just to have on.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Junie	For the briefest of seconds, my father’s eyes met my mother’s and they both looked away. Something was wrong. “Since when don’t you want a little ice cream?” she said to [MASK]. “Some days need a little sprucin up.”
<name>Janice</name>	Janice	Sirens	People were everywhere—women and men, some of them parents, mostly teachers—calming or calling out, persuading us to run down the slope to the football field. “Hurry!” “That way!” [MASK] wailed. We got ourselves to the field.
<name>He</name>	He	Spirit	With anthems, the choir has to know each note by name. He looks at them now, studying as they go, moving their lips to the two-three-fours in between and never taking their eyes from the page. [MASK] hasn’t got a chance.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Geraldine	I imagined how homey our front room and kitchen would look to [MASK]’s eyes, how pretty my mother would look with her new cut bangs, opening the door and smiling with her beautiful teeth and the beauty mole on her chin.
<name>The Giver</name>	The Giver	Dele	According to [MASK], the twins were not ordinary people. All twins, he said, have the power to bring good fortune into the lives of those who treat them well. Whatever they want, they get. The wise do everything they can to make twins happy.
<name>August</name>	August	Folami	“Wait,” [MASK] said. “You look dead. You ought to move around. When we tell stories, we move our arms and look at people. We make faces and jump around. Don’t just stand there. Do something!
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Thomas	Likely, too, no one would be there if they entered. [MASK] pressed switches on the wall just inside the door. Although the main lights went out, lights in the entryway stayed on. The glow from the vestibule filtered through windows of the swinging doors into the dark sanctuary.
<name>She</name>	She	Wanda	I said I’d see her later and started back across the street. I remember the evening as chilly, with a sun of molten-red lava about to erupt through cracks in the blue-gray clouds. [MASK] didn’t go in right away.
<name>God</name>	God	Folami	Suppose somebody at school walks in while you’re up there. Are you going to stop?” [MASK] asked. Then down between The darkness and the light He hurled the world; Then He stopped and looked and saw That the earth was hot and barren.
<name>Anne's</name>	Anne's	Wanda	I was passing time. Alone in [MASK]’s room. The whole thing was a fluke. I looked around her room. Because it was secret, just because it was secret, I felt beneath her pillow. The diary was still there.
<name>Sergeant</name>	Sergeant	James	Men had stationed themselves like steps to toss the bags on the topmost layer. A trooper paced the ground at the base and kept constant dialogue with the crackle from his walkie-talkie. “What’s the word?” [MASK] asked the trooper.
<name>Harvey</name>	Harvey	Thomas	He has to start with something normal, or else the whole thing will seem just too low-down. [MASK] drove up the unpaved road expecting to see neon reindeer strung across the roof of the mall, or a gigantic creche.
<name>her</name>	her	Wanda	With her mother falling apart, she probably had her hands full and wouldn’t have come looking for me anyway. But I suspect that in the back of my mind I wanted [MASK] to know that I too had something to lament.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Irene	“What’s there to see?” I croaked. “That’s enough, [MASK],” my mother said. “You just calm down before you get these children upset.” Because no more words could form themselves right then, I stood up and glared at them.
<name>Baba</name>	Baba	Akin	The shiny coal of an old woman, her skinny white braids sprouting like a fringe from her red gele. The carved stool in the comer of the first room where she sat. The snuff she packed into her lower lip. The second room and the low table with no chairs. [MASK] in gray overalls.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Lydia	At the cemetery, on the entire length of [MASK]’s grave, he took special care to arrange the brilliant colors—the orange with the yellow, the sapphire with the purple, vermilion, pink, magenta—so that they dazzled him to tears.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	James	“You almost drowned yourself hollering like something got a hold of you.” [MASK] nodded his head yes. When he wiped away some of the mud, he could make out only dark and darker, then forms—sky, trees, pale gravel.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Dele	I wanted to show him the streets where history had begun to unfold. “It isn’t going to make any difference,” [MASK] said. “White people don’t want you all in their schools, and no court can change that.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Wanda	“It made his missing leg ache.” That was enough. Not only had I opened the door to expose our family’s failures, but also I had stepped on [MASK]’s father’s grave. We passed the bowls around the table.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Puddin	“Not me,” [MASK] said, only it came out Naa-mee. He never just up and said anything on his own except when he got mad, and then we could only guess at what he was trying to say. “What is it?
<name>Enid</name>	Enid	Wanda	Dizzy above the leaden, gray stream, I had nothing to hold on to. I knelt down. [MASK] kept walking ahead of me. Then when neither of them would come back, I crawled on hands and knees, afraid to keep my eyes shut, afraid to open them.
<name>Holly</name>	Holly	Wanda	[MASK] came by nearly every evening, wearing her black-and-white Cakebox uniform, taking a shortcut through the alley to her place. She brought him little cake boxes of dough- nuts or bear claws from the bakery in the county mall where she worked days.
<name>David</name>	David	Hank	“Yes, ma’am,” [MASK] said. His story included being caught out of his seat even though it was recess, being yanked by the arm that was still sore, being frightened enough to swear, and being slapped.
<name>his</name>	his	Pearl	Of course he stayed on his back about going to church and saving for a house he could buy for [MASK] and the kids. But that came with the territory. “So you goin out there with us?”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Eddy	After [MASK]’s accident, he gave me a cherry bomb. His last. I kept it in my cigar box as a sort of memento of good times. Even if I had wanted to explode it, my mother had threatened to do worse to us if we so much as looked at fireworks again.
<name>Esperanza</name>	Esperanza	Wanda	She made us hold on to the rosary and swear that, counting off the beads, we would say these prayers every morning and every night. [MASK] shook her head. “My mother don’t want me doing that,” she said.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Folami	“It’s just a poem out of a book. It doesn’t mean anything,” [MASK] said. Her mother stood abruptly, and pointed a long finger nearly touching my chest. “Don’t come back here to our place with stories,” she said.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Pemberton	I told her, I said, “I know my timing ain’t too keen, but I told you long time ago me and [MASK] is very careful about stuff like this.” She kept on wiping her eyes and nodding her head yes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Eddy	“You don’t think he went on over to the river, do you?” “Not without telling me,” [MASK] said. “Then where is he? Where was he when you came out?” “He was right there.”
<name>someone</name>	someone	Puddin	I could see that she had been crying, which meant that [MASK] was gone. But in my own confused state that day I had little to give her. I remember saying “Hi,” and her rushing in and sitting on the sofa.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Maurice	Not examine it. Not act on it. For the past few months, he was happy just to lend her money, get her to [MASK]’s when the days were short and cold, pick her up when she couldn’t get a cab, and when she could.
<name>Dr. Alice Kinnian</name>	Dr. Alice Kinnian	Wanda	This makes the eleventh dozen time he’s done something she can’t fix.” Since most of the time I saw [MASK] as the model of composure, in full control, I had no experience with the role of comforter. I knocked hesitantly on her door.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Reenie	You ain’t heard me make a peep, and I ain’t heard you complaining either.” “Well, who’s going to see to the kids?” she said. “Don’t worry about the kids. They all in school. [MASK] can help.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Pemberton	[MASK] was shocked, all right. He shook his head and went on in the bathroom. I suspect he sat in the tub over a hour. I know the news got him because he whistled low like he do when something big is on his mind.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddy	Come on!” We looked into the pool but saw nothing through the muddy green. We ran around the pool to [MASK]’s side. “You don’t think he went on over to the river, do you?”
<name>his brother</name>	his brother	Wanda	He won’t even touch what the janitor said he saw. He’ll have to get by without going into details. That night, riding home from the mall through the empty streets, exhilarating calm rang in his head. He looked over at [MASK].
<name>John</name>	John	Woolworth	[MASK]’s on the avenue gave us a ten percent discount at the Colored Only eating counter. Less than two weeks after the crash, businessmen—black and white—did what people said they should have done long ago.
<name>Debbie</name>	Debbie	Wanda	He will draw that same picture for the church here. Everyone will understand their wanting to spend Thanksgiving together. He can see [MASK] scat-bopping the music inside her while she made a mess of his kitchen. In a way, he’s like a father.
<name>Cassie</name>	Cassie	Wanda	“I’m going,” [MASK] said. As she ran, she yelled, “I’m going to get y’all’s daddy. My mamma’s going to be mad. I ain’t got no business by the river.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Eddy	“Then where is he? Where was he when you came out?” “He was right there.” [MASK] pointed. “Right out there in the middle. He can swim better than anybody. Let’s just wait, hear?”
<name>Mama</name>	Mama	Lord	[MASK] knows I didn’t need no grease in my hair. “It’ll loosen up all the old skin on your scalp,” she said. I told her I was old all over, wasn’t enough grease in the world to help that.
<name>David</name>	David	John	[MASK] Good-son whispered as he tapped my back with his pencil. I hunched my shoulders. I was not about to start again this year keeping him up on his math. My eyes were drawn to the planes—two plus signs above the horizon, growing larger, heading in fast.
<name>Arnold</name>	Arnold	Nick	[MASK] waited until the last sheet was stretched and pinned and the long pole was jacked up to raise the clothesline higher before he said a word. “Found a new pedal for my bike,” he yelled. I went inside the screen door but turned to see him sliding down from his perch.
<name>He</name>	He	Pemberton	I tell him all the time about answering the door with no clothes on. Don’t no well-to-do people answer the door in their undershirt and house shoes. “Who’re you?” [MASK] asked her. She told him who she was.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Wanda	At once the congregation’s collective posture undoes itself to a jumble of hats, coats, hands pulling, little legs running. In the stir, [MASK] gets up and moves toward the front of the church. Nobody seems to notice.
<name>Dolores</name>	Dolores	Pearlean	It is dusk. Everything is suspended. A day that started brilliantly and burned along a steady course, now treks so deeply into darkness that it has lost its way. [MASK] combs her hair. Her husband is working late. Who does she love?
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Jocelyn	Biggest thing, she took to going out Saturday nights. Since [MASK] went with her, and they wasn’t out too late, I figured the girls was having some clean fun. You should have heard them, “How I look in this?”
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Puddin	But it wasn’t really Christmas like we used to have when my father was alive and [MASK] was at home. ” Was she feeling him out for spending the holidays together? She stretched her arm across his shoulders and let her hand warm the back of his neck.
<name>the deceased</name>	the deceased	Puddin	I heard the sadness in her voice and understood that this invitation to dinner was our acknowledgment of their loss. Clearly no one should mention [MASK]. Our careful conversation started with the possibility of snow. I had never before taken part in a conversation with a group that included my mother.
<name>She</name>	She	Geraldine	The cut bangs and the beautiful profile filled my entire view. She was not a stranger. My hand froze on the doorknob. “Don’t!” [MASK] whispered, and swatted my hand, jiggling the knob. The man said something very close to the door.
<name>John</name>	John	Obadele	That in it I could discover the wonder of everything turning to dust, and my hunger for the smell of earth’s dark life. [MASK] knew the effect that smell would have on me as he oiled it into his pores.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Wanda	“Right out there in the middle. He can swim better than anybody. Let’s just wait, hear?” “Uh-uh,” [MASK] said. “We ought to get somebody. Suppose something happened to him.”
<name>her</name>	her	Pemberton	We was both getting old. We didn’t have no business fighting. First thing you know, people would be talking about us. I didn’t know what got into [MASK], but I wasn’t going to let that girl mess over us.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Wanda	As the holidays approached, the weather became more severe. I spent most of my spare time with [MASK]. I told her about our split house, and when I saw that she really listened, I wanted her to know how it got that way.
<name>June</name>	June	Thomas	She continues to regard the inside of her closet like a place she’s never seen before. “I’m in this with you, [MASK], but if I ever felt glad about not belonging to your church, today is the day. And you know what?
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	James”—for	A pretty dress. Black, crepe, French. She arched herself, swung her legs, girl on a swing. When my father stood up to go, he slid his arms into her holding of his mackinaw. She held the door—“Bye, [MASK] us.
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Ree	We each took armloads of clothes, which we hung in the closet and folded in sloppy heaps on the bed. At one point in our questionable enterprise she said softly, “[MASK], he’s the nicest man I ever met. ”
<name>he</name>	he	Wanda	“It’s a nice book, but [MASK] isn’t ever going to make use of it.” She said that if I wanted I could keep it for a while. I took the book home. The more I read, the more excited I became about the poems.
<name>Spring</name>	Spring	Summer	Spring was unraveling everywhere. [MASK] was coming when I would go hunting for wild greens with my father, when we would be up in the warm, damp mornings taking his gun-nysack with us along the railroad tracks all the way to the woods.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Nick	As she ran, she yelled, “I’m going to get y’all’s daddy. My mamma’s going to be mad. I ain’t got no business by the river.” “[MASK]’s gonna get it.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	James	“I’ve got family waiting,” he said. “I’m thinking about pulling out before too long.” The man had said it with such a note of delight that [MASK] wanted to see his face. When the man turned again, his expression revealed little.
<name>the preacher</name>	the preacher	Reverend	One-ten. He has been sitting for more than an hour while [MASK] preached and he hasn’t uttered a single amen, paid practically no attention at all. If he could just stand up and stretch, walk up the aisle and out the door.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Wanda	[MASK] chuckles. December sleet crackles static on the windows and she complains that her straw hat with the blue flowers won’t do for wintertime, not with her mother’s old Persian lamb, and how she needs the hat for the dress to look churchy.
<name>Sister Taylor</name>	Sister Taylor	Wanda	I didn’t say you was scared, I just want to be there. What’s wrong with that?” “Well, you know you can’t sit with me, don’t you? I’m sitting up front with the deacons.” [MASK] moves her hand.
<name>his wife</name>	his wife	Pearl	That this one life was the only life he would ever have. Maybe he should simply walk away. The gulf between the kind of life he sometimes imagined and his life with [MASK] seemed as uncrossable as a wild river.
<name>Walt</name>	Walt	Pemberton	Many a night I listened at the vent upstairs as he sat at the kitchen table telling that story and explaining the practical side of destiny to my mother. “[MASK] wants us to be partners,” he said. “But he don’t want to operate the place.
<name>June</name>	June	Folami	“Sit down,” she said. I sat down. She looked out her window and shook her head. Then she sat down beside me and surrendered. “You know [MASK], right? “Yeah.” “Well, she’s pregnant.”
