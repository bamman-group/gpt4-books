<name>Assassin</name>	Assassin	Cain	He wasn’t dead; he was in hiding. [MASK] botched more than one assignment; it was inevitable. He accepted too many in too short a time. Yet whenever he did, he followed an abortive kill with a spectacular, unsolicited one, to uphold his stature.
<name>Connell</name>	Connell	Washburn	Now!” “I ... I can’t. ” The man’s eyes were on the edge of helplessness. “Because you don’t believe either one.” The man shook his head. “No. Do you?” “No,” said [MASK].
<name>Voldemort</name>	Voldemort	Cain	Are you aware of the burden you ask for?” “I would much prefer not to have it. My only hope is that when this is over and [MASK] is dead, you will remember my contributions and rather than killing me, change the number.”
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Bourne	“An affair of the heart. One must catch the betrayer in the act.” “In church, monsieur? The world moves too swiftly for me.” “Not in traffic,” said [MASK]. They approached the final comer before the Church of the Blessed Sacrament.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Logical	And as for you, you’re a statistic in the Paris morgue.” “And you?” “According to the plan I’m dead too. They expect to take me through you.” “[MASK].
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Jason	[MASK] heard the clatter of the knife on the floor. He lurched toward the sound, at the same time reaching into his belt for his gun. It caught on the cloth; he rolled on the floor, but not quickly enough.
<name>Alayne</name>	Alayne	Carlos	“I urge you to remember, [MASK],” pleaded the beggar. “The messenger is not responsible for the news he bears. I could have refused to hear it, refused to bring it to you.” “How? Why? ...”
<name>Leamas</name>	Leamas	d’Amacourt	Ten seconds in a passport-control room, a photograph of a photograph; arrangements can be made. No, they committed a serious oversight.” “I guess they did.” “And you,” continued [MASK], “just told me something else.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Crawford	Come to me. Let me find you. Do not leave me for these blind, mindless men. Do not let them take you from me. Where was [MASK]? He had promised to keep her informed of every move, everything. She had been blunt.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Jules	“Take two steps back,” he said in French. “No more, just two. And then stand still.” He tapped the head of the man named [MASK]. “Get out. Slowly.”
<name>Adelaide</name>	Adelaide	Cain	What you know about [MASK].” Stay controlled. You cannot turn away. Look at her. Look at her! “Where shall I begin?” “With whatever comes to mind first. Where did he come from?” Do not look away!
<name>He</name>	He	Marie	[MASK] spoke slowly, forcing him to listen. “What caused them?” “I don’t know.” “You just saw the Brielle woman. Did she say something to you? Something that made you think of something else?” “I’m not sure.
<name>Goldfinger</name>	Goldfinger	Carlos	“You have extraordinary knowledge about [MASK]. I’ve studied those files as closely as any man alive, for I would give more than any man alive to see him caught and executed, I alone the firing squad. And as swollen as they are, those files do not approach what you know.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marie	He nodded, reassuring her; it was not a bad moment for him. Instead, images had come to him. He had been to that cemetery; somehow he would know it. He walked toward [MASK]; she turned and fell in step beside him as they headed for the exit.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Jason	[MASK] held his breath as their eyes met; the man stared, then blinked and stared again. He shook his head, closing his lids, then opened them wide, taking in the sight he was not entirely sure was there.
<name>He</name>	He	Jason	she asked. “A company that wants its money. A great deal of money. He has it.” “He did not earn it, then?” [MASK] knew he had to be careful; he was expected to know far more than he did.
<name>He</name>	He	Jason	I knew it. That’s all I can tell you.” “How?” “I wish I could answer that. I can’t.” “May I have a drink?” “Certainly.” [MASK] got up and went to the bureau.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Bourne	[MASK] rammed his knee into the man’s chest; he could feel the holster. He yanked the overcoat open, reached in, and pulled out a short-barreled revolver. For an instant it occurred to him that someone had deactivated the scanning machinery in the elevator.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Cain	“So by keeping as tight a lid as you can on that reputation you’re holding back free advertising.” “Exactly. There are a lot of maniacs in this world with too many real or imagined enemies who might easily gravitate to [MASK] if they knew of him.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Delta	“You don’t have exclusive insights. [MASK]’s conduct in the field was continuously and overtly hostile to command. I was in a position to observe that pattern somewhat more clearly than you.” “Most of the time he had every right to be.
<name>David</name>	David	Bourne	[MASK] swung around in the seat and looked at it through the rear window. The seizure was receding, the sights and sound of personal panic fading; only the pain remained, but it too would diminish, he knew that. It had been an extraordinary few minutes.
<name>He</name>	He	Jason	Where it all took place; they’ve got to understand. He knew about it. Trust me.” “I do. The second question, then. Why will he come after you?” [MASK] looked again at the dead woman on the bed.
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Bourne	[MASK] did not know the face, but the face knew him. The man brought his fingers to his lips and wiped the corners of his mouth, then shifted his eyes, taking in each diner at every table. Only then did he begin what was obviously a painful journey around the room .
<name>Bradley</name>	Bradley	Conklin	“He’s brighter than most of the clowns you’ve got over there.” “That’s not only unnecessary, [MASK],” admonished the senator, “but patently offensive. Go on, please, General.”
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Abbott	“Yes, yes . . . the Monk. His name was [MASK].” “Very good. And the Yachtsman? You remember the Yachtsman, don’t you? And his wife?” “Names. They’re there, yes. No faces.”
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Jason	[MASK] reached for his wrist; the trembling had begun again, the sound of distant thunder vibrating in far regions of his skull. “You’re . . . sure of that?” “Very much so. He wasn’t dead; he was in hiding.
<name>Jeremy</name>	Jeremy	Bourne	[MASK] had an almost uncontrollable urge to race down between the rows of graves and statuary, shouting at the top of his voice. I’m here! It’s me. I understand your message. I’ve come back! I have so much to tell you . . .
<name>Stalin</name>	Stalin	Abbott	“How could he? He doesn’t know what to evaluate. Everything [MASK] does is shrouded in secrecy; no one knows how many mistakes he’s made. And if any come to light, men like me are blamed for them.”
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bourne	Behind which door? Or was the assassin using a better strategy? Was he in the darkness of the narrow hallway itself? [MASK] felt a stabbing jolt of pain in his shoulder blade, then an eruption of blood that drenched the flannel shirt beneath his field jacket.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Carlos	It was true; he had told her everything that had come to him, yet somehow he had omitted [MASK]. . . almost purposely, as if blocking it out. “I guess I didn’t,” he said. “You seem to know.
<name>Trujillo</name>	Trujillo	Villiers	What kind of security arrangements did [MASK] have? Who guarded the general and how many were there? And because he had been convinced he would find either men in cars or other men walking their posts, he was startled to realize there was no one.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Carlos	the general drew back. “You’ve said nothing about a woman, or anyone else.” “There is no one else. Without her I wouldn’t be alive. [MASK] is hunting both of us; he’s tried to kill both of us.”
<name>Godzilla</name>	Godzilla	Carlos	A whole floor is crammed with back issues of old magazines, thousands of them. He even catalogues subjects, indexes them like a librarian. I’d like to find out if [MASK] is in that index. Will you do it?”
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Bourne	“Put him inside. Strip him. I want photographs taken of him naked—before and after he leaves us. You’ll find a great deal of money on him; I want him holding it. I’ll drive.” He looked again at [MASK].
<name>Locke</name>	Locke	Jason	If he does not fall, you are taken. If he does, you are misled, lulled into a false sense of progress.” “It’s a high degree of risk,” said [MASK]. “For those in the gauntlet.”
<name>Roark</name>	Roark	Lamouche	On the other hand, [MASK] is something of a storm himself; he’s a difficult man. The swelling in his leg will go down and he’ll resent you. So will others; you’ll have to replace someone.” “Thanks a lot.”
<name>Jonathan</name>	Jonathan	Bourne	The sun had risen to the midpoint of the surrounding trees, its rays filtered by windblown branches, streaming through the windows and mottling the walls with irregular shapes of light. [MASK] lay back on the pillow, exhausted. He had finished; there was nothing more to say.
<name>John</name>	John	Bourne	The lapels of his topcoat were pulled up, his head covered by a narrow- brimmed hat, shading his unseen face. [MASK] stared at this man; there was something familiar about him, about the figure, the walk, the way he carried his head.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Treadstone	Near the steps. At the taxi stand.” “The Louvre? Crowds? Information you think I have that will send you away? You can’t reasonably expect me to discuss my employer.” “Not yours. Mine.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Bourne	He reached the concrete steps as two muscular men, one black, one white, were carrying a covered harp out the door. [MASK] stopped and called out, his words halting, his dialect coarse. “Hey!
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bourne	“Like a movie,” commented [MASK], looking behind him at the crowds at the far end of the corridor. He was there; the man with gold-rimmed spectacles was excusing himself past an animated trio in the lobby.
<name>John</name>	John	Bourne	“No,” she said. “It was too late.” The bathroom door closed; [MASK] walked to the desk across the room. He opened the drawer, took out stationery, picked up the ballpoint pen and wrote the words: It’s over.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Caesar	“Very good.” “I just don’t want any more violence. I don’t want to know anything or see anything. I just want to—” “I know,” he interrupted. “Go back to [MASK]’s taxes and the Punic wars.
<name>He</name>	He	Loving	For the certainty had been made clear. He knew who he was . . . what he had been; he was guilty as charged—as suspected. An hour or two saying nothing. Just watching, talking quietly about anything but the truth. [MASK].
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Marie	If the pay phone in the bank was not in use, [MASK] would pick it up before the ring had barely started. She did. “Yes?” “See anything?” “A great deal. D’Amacourt’s your man.” 12
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jason	whispered [MASK], using his body to cover her face from the curious newsdealer, reaching into his pocket for coins. He threw the money on the counter, grabbed two papers, and propelled her down the dark, rainsoaked street. They were both in the labyrinth now.
<name>He</name>	He	Priorities	It had been an extraordinary few minutes. [MASK] had become twisted; compulsion had replaced reason, the pull of the unknown had been so strong that for a moment or two he had nearly lost control. He could not let it happen again; the trap itself was everything.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jason	Rays of his own personal sunlight burst into the dark corners of [MASK]’s mind. In the distance, doors were opening, but they were still too far away and opened only partially. But there was light where before there was only darkness.
<name>Scarface</name>	Scarface	Monk	[MASK]! “Get her!” he roared at the chauffeur, spinning around, his weapon leveled at the door at the end of the hallway. The uniformed man raced up the staircase; there was a gunshot; it came from a powerful weapon—unmuffled, unsilenced.
<name>Arctor</name>	Arctor	Washburn	Come with me.” [MASK] preceded the man through the living room to the door in the rear wall that led to the dispensary. Inside, he went to the corner and picked up an antiquated projector, the shell of its thick round lens rusted and cracked.
<name>Harding</name>	Harding	Webb	“He knows there’s a board; [MASK] might have told him we’d all be there, reasonably expecting that we would. We’ve got a lot of questions—six months’ worth, and now several million dollars.
<name>Quiller</name>	Quiller	D’Anjou	What had he done? [MASK] was gone! How had it happened? The reverse trap was no trap at all. His own strategy had been used against him, permitting the only man who could give him the answers to escape.
<name>Chalmers</name>	Chalmers	Crawford	But it’s prepared—a half a dozen rifles ready to fire when the condemned man comes into view. Am I reading the scenario?” “You don’t expect me to answer that,” said [MASK]. “You don’t have to.
<name>Alfred</name>	Alfred	Jason	Light romantic music floated out of the dark ceiling, quiet crescendos abstractly punctuated by the beams of the miniature spotlights. [MASK] wandered through the aisles, studying manikins, touching the fabric, making his own appraisals. They covered his essential bewilderment.
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Peter	He’ll accept that.” “Would he know someone at the embassy here?” “[MASK] makes it a point to know someone everywhere. It’s one of his more useful but less attractive traits.” “Sounds like he will.”
<name>Frankie</name>	Frankie	Jason	It’s further away, capisce?” “Yeah, I capisce. ” [MASK] bent down for the blankets and the straps. “Leave that junk here—you don’t need it. Get upstairs, top floor, and start with the single wood units.
<name>Rick</name>	Rick	Bourne	[MASK] rolled the intruder over and took out a billfold. Second nature made him remove the money, knowing it was ludicrous to do so; he had a small fortune on him. He looked at the various credit cards and the drivers license; he smiled, but then his smile disappeared.
<name>Remo</name>	Remo	Delta	Better a controlled situation than one in which there’s no control at all.” “Now I hear [MASK],” said d’Anjou. “He doesn’t create his own trap; he doesn’t walk in front of a firing squad and ask for a blindfold.”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Peter	She was shaking, breathing in swallows and gasps, her eyes glazed, coming into focus as she looked at him. “They killed him. They killed him! My God, what did I do? [MASK]!” “You didn’t do it!
<name>Travis</name>	Travis	Jason	[MASK] drank. “Darling, there’s a famous bookstore on the boulevard Saint-Germain that’s run by a magazine freak. A whole floor is crammed with back issues of old magazines, thousands of them. He even catalogues subjects, indexes them like a librarian.
<name>Steiner</name>	Steiner	Koenig	“The how I can only guess; the who I know.” “Who?” “A man named [MASK]. Until three days ago he was in charge of primary verifications at the Gemeinschaft Bank.” “Three days ago? Where is he now?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Villiers	Fire. Out of nowhere. Sudden, away from [MASK]’ house, yet close enough and startling enough to send vibrations throughout the quiet, deserted, tree-lined street. Vibrations . . . sirens; explosive . . . explosions. It could be done.
<name>Magwitch</name>	Magwitch	Marie	“And he’s been one of you from the beginning,” said [MASK]. “There were no slates to clean, no payments or pardons bargained for?” “None. You’ll be told everything in time, but this is not the time.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Marie	It did not matter. It was behind him now; soon there would be the darkness, not violent but peaceful . . . freedom from that question. And with his death [MASK] would be free, his love would be free.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Bourne	And when it does, you have got to stop, we know that, too. Come back to the hotel. Please.” [MASK] closed his eyes, the sweat was drying and the sounds of the traffic outside the booth replaced the screeching in his ears.
<name>He</name>	He	Jason	You’re only two or three feet in front of me; there’s no way I could miss if I fired.” She did as she was told, a terrified automaton. [MASK] supported himself on the frame of the window and pulled himself to the pavement.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Bourne	13 [MASK] held her in the close confines of the glass booth, gently lowering her to the seat that protruded from the narrow wall. She was shaking, breathing in swallows and gasps, her eyes glazed, coming into focus as she looked at him.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Alan	When the bell rang, she could not take the time to crush it out. It rang. She opened the glass door of the booth and went inside. “Is this you, [MASK]?” “Yes,” was the curt reply.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Cain	... All right! You can think, you can feel. Think now, feel now! Look at me and tell me you’ve looked inside yourself, inside your thoughts and feelings, and you know without a doubt you’re an assassin called [MASK]!
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Jason	[MASK] looked at her in the dim light. “Wipe off your lipstick. All of it.” She took out a tissue and did so. “All right?” “Yes. Have you got an eyebrow pencil?” “Of course.”
<name>Scarlett</name>	Scarlett	Carlos	The light vanished, only the wash of the moon remained, but it was enough to illuminate the terrace. There was no one there, no guard patrolling the wide double doors that led to the inside room. [MASK].
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Carlos	I didn’t do the things they say I did, but no one wants to listen. I have no pact with [MASK]—you know I don’t.” “I believe you. There’s nothing to prevent me from making a call on your behalf.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Villiers	“Feelings are not reality!” shot back the old soldier vehemently. “They have no place in observing the field.” “Then why are you telling me this?” [MASK]’ head arched back, then fell forward, his eyes on the water.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Koenig	How? Why? From where? The entire business had taken an hour and twenty minutes, only one discordant note intruding on the smooth proceedings. In character, it had been delivered by [MASK], his expression a mixture of solemnity and minor triumph.
<name>Jamie</name>	Jamie	Villiers	Someone said that to me recently, someone very dear to you.” [MASK] spoke quietly. “She shamed an old warrior into remembering who he was . . . who he had been. ‘On dit que vous etes un geant. Je le crois. ’
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Carlos	Anything else?” “Only what you obviously know, the strategy of which I admit eludes me.” “Which is?” “That the Americans think you turned. Better phrased, they want [MASK] to believe they think you turned.” “Why?”
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Balance	[MASK] was gone and he was falling again, only to be stopped again, another body against his body, a hand holding him, lowering him. His face felt cool; and then he felt nothing. He was drifting again, currents gentler now, darkness complete.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Peter	“Quite a few, I guess.” “You guess?” “Most of the time.” “And you, [MASK]? What about the Agency?” “We’ve been severely limited in terms of in-depth dissemination.”
<name>Renard</name>	Renard	Mme	far better than I can an ultimatum. Others will relay it to the one who decides.” “What you’re saying is what I said a few minutes ago: we can talk.” “We can talk, monsieur,” agreed [MASK].
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Webb	Major. Nothing but static on that thing anyway. But since I don’t know where it is and these wheels aren’t supposed to go there, where do you want to be dropped off?” [MASK] smiled. “No more than two blocks away.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Conklin	“Well, listen further. My name’s [MASK], Central Intelligence Agency, Four-Zero clearance. You do know what that means?” “I haven’t understood anything you people’ve said in the past ten years.” “You’d better understand this.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jason	[MASK] dove to his left, freeing his gun, leveling it at the sounds in the darkness. He fired, the explosion deafening, useless. He heard the door crash shut; the killer had raced out into the hallway. Trying to fill his lungs with air.
<name>Runciter</name>	Runciter	Washburn	It’s as though blocks were rearranged, the physical structure no longer what it was.” Again [MASK] stopped. “And, ” pressed the man. “The recessed psychological pressures will allow—are allowing—your skills and talents to come back to you.
<name>Bourne</name>	Bourne	Bourne	The man from Treadstone limped toward him, then stopped, raising his flashlight, the harsh beam causing [MASK] to squint and turn his head away. “It’s been a long time,” said the crippled officer, lowering the light.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Marie	The aide nodded and walked to a table ten feet away from the booth; he would leave but he was still on guard. The exhausted old soldier looked at [MASK]. “Why did you insist on my coming here?
<name>Langdon</name>	Langdon	Bourne	” [MASK] trailed off the words, a man with too much wine trying to concentrate. “Just turn left out of the exit, sir. Stay on the Uto Quai for about one hundred meters, until you reach a large pier, then turn right.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Oreale	If you’re not out of here in three minutes I’ll have to return.” He took his hand out of his pocket. In it was his gun. [MASK] expunged a lungful of air, his face ashen as he stared at the weapon.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Jason	The sinews of his bare arms moved under the flesh as he transferred the phone from one hand to the other, speaking harshly. “Pas id. Sais pas. Telephonez plus tard ...” He hung up and looked at [MASK].
<name>Stratton</name>	Stratton	Bourne	But the names aren’t important any longer; they never were, really. All that remains is the final isolation—removing of the man-monk who makes the decisions. You. [MASK] is trapped. He’s finished.” “There are others who make decisions.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Cain	“Because I’ve just proved my point again. Even the condemned man—so sure of his own guilt—should see it.The man called [MASK] would never do what you just offered to do. For anyone.”
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Villiers	If for any reason you can’t talk, tell me to call your secretary in the morning. I’ll call back in ten minutes. What’s the number?” [MASK] gave it to him. “Your hotel?” asked the general.
<name>Hal</name>	Hal	Jason	He could see the stars in the cold night sky, no more blinding sunlight, no more unbearable heat. It had passed, whatever it was. “I’m all right. Really, I’m okay now. A couple of bad moments, that’s all.” “[MASK]?”
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Marie	[MASK] stopped, she shook her head and continued softly. “I’ll do whatever you ask, you know that. Can you reach this Conklin?” “I’m sure I can. I’ll stand on the steps of that house until he has no choice but to reach me.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Walters	“For a number of months recently we thought he might have been taken himself. There were several probables in which the killers themselves were eliminated; we thought he might have been one of them.” “Such as?” asked [MASK].
<name>Coriolanus</name>	Coriolanus	Carlos	Among the very few who speak of such things, it is said she is [MASK]’s first cousin, his lover since the age of fourteen. It is rumored—among those very few people—that beyond himself, she is the only person on earth he cares about.”
<name>others</name>	others	Carlos	But it is his arrogance, his lies at the expense of [MASK] that will bring him down.” “And that makes him American? Or is it your bias? I have an idea you like American money, but that’s about all they export that you do like.”
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Bourne	She said I was to look upon your designs as the work of an emerging master.” [MASK] smiled again. “You’re the reason I may have to wire the Bahamas for a great deal of money.” “You’re most kind, monsieur.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Villiers	[MASK]’ hands shook; the trembling spread to his head. “Do not do this. I’m telling you, do not do this.” “Telling me? You mean you’re giving me an order? The little old man with the big brass buttons is issuing a command?
<name>Morgan</name>	Morgan	Oreale	“Open up and get inside.” “It’s bolted,” replied [MASK]. “It’s always bolted during these times.” “You damn fool, we had to reach you! We had to get you here without anyone knowing why.
<name>Lucifer</name>	Lucifer	Carlos	“We’re trying to save her life. We’ve turned [MASK]’s weapon against him.” “How?” The Monk raised his hand. “Before we answer we have to go back to another question,” he said.
