<name>Gandalf</name>	Gandalf	Bond	He echoed the thought [MASK] had had. ‘Well, the game must begin sometime. I have made certain small moves. Now we can only wait and see. We will make a little foray into enemy territory after lunch. I think it will interest you.
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Tatiana	Here, drink this down. ’ [MASK] pulled a handkerchief out of the waistband of her skirt and dabbed at her eyes. She reached out a trembling hand for the glass of champagne and sipped at it with bowed head. ‘Drink it down, my dear. ’
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Nash	‘Well, come on, old man. ’ [MASK] sounded hooked. ‘Not without a cigarette. ’ ‘Okay. Go ahead. But if there’s a move I don’t like, you’ll be dead. ’
<name>Mrs. Grose</name>	Mrs. Grose	May	‘Yes-s,’ said [MASK] doubtfully. At any rate she had carried out her orders to tell him if she saw anyone ‘hanging about the place’. She bustled off with a whisper of the old-fashioned black uniform she persisted in wearing even in the heat of August.
<name>Mr. Brown</name>	Mr. Brown	Bond	By hire purchase, too, if you please!’ ‘Persistent chaps these salesmen. ’ [MASK] put down his paper and reached for the coffee pot. ‘I gave him a right piece of my mind last night. Disturbing folk at their supper.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Bond	He opened the door, ‘and romance. ’ He smiled across the compartment. ‘I will call for you at lunchtime! Greek food is worse than Turkish, but even my stomach is in the service of the Queen. ’ [MASK] got up and locked the door.
<name>Ezra</name>	Ezra	Kerim	It is her dowry. ’ They walked over to the table. Two places had been cleared on either side of the head gipsy. [MASK] gave what sounded like a polite greeting to the table. There was a curt nod of acknowledgment. They sat down.
<name>he</name>	he	Bond	Curious accent. What was it? A hint of brogue - cheap brogue. And something else [MASK] couldn’t define. Probably came from living too long abroad and talking foreign languages all the time. And that dreadful ‘old man’ at the end. Shyness.
<name>Kissinger</name>	Kissinger	Darko	I wish your government would realize it and be strong with them. Just an occasional little lesson in manners like I have taught them tonight. ’ ‘In power politics, one doesn’t often have the chance of being as quick and neat as you were tonight, [MASK].
<name>Scheherazade</name>	Scheherazade	Bond	There was a cool, musty scent of spices and coffee and, as [MASK] followed the watchman down the central passage-way, a sudden strong wave of mint. At the end of the long warehouse was a raised platform enclosed by a balustrade.
<name>Bond</name>	Bond	Kronsteen	[MASK]’s eyes moved to the red velvet table-top in front of him. Thoughtfully, as if this was the kernel of the problem, he added: ‘We shall also require a reliable and extremely beautiful girl.’ 8.......... THE BEAUTIFUL LURE
<name>Lydia</name>	Lydia	Bond	The girl has made no sign of life since my signal and I have no other information. But perhaps you would like to ask me some questions about the meeting. ’ ‘There’s only one thing I want to know,’ said [MASK] flatly.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bond	Please duschka. ’ [MASK] had taken off his coat and tie and had arranged himself in the corner with his feet up on his suitcase and the Beretta under the pillow within reach of his hand. She had made no comment about the gun.
<name>James</name>	James	M.	Every conceivable angle of the evidence, for and against, had been scrutinized - not only by [MASK], but also by a full-dress operations meeting of Heads of Sections that had worked all through the afternoon and evening before.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bond	Out of the corner of his eye he noticed a curl of blue smoke coming from the mouth of the ‘telephone’. Then the woman was on him, the knitting needles glinting in her clenched fists. She stabbed downwards at his legs. [MASK] lashed out with his feet and hurled her sideways.
<name>Stalin</name>	Stalin	Yavra	They like mass death. [MASK] was a main target, I was another. The declaration of war against me personally I can also understand. But it seems that you were not to be harmed. You were exactly described so that there should be no mistake.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bond	‘Gas main I suppose. ’ [MASK] saw again the obscene belly of the bomb hanging down from the roof of the alcove in the tunnel, the wires that started off down the damp wall on their way back to the plunger in the drawer of Kerims desk.
<name>Fagin</name>	Fagin	Kerim	One of the policemen lifted his hand to the back of his neck. The two policemen turned and walked away, their boots ringing loudly on the paving stones. ‘Few minutes more,’ whispered [MASK]. ‘They’ve got to get round the back of that hoarding. ’
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Bond	‘Madam was late,’ said the attendant. ‘She came along the corridor. She must have entered by the last carriage. ’ [MASK] went down the carpeted corridor to the centre coupe. A black 7 stood above a black 8 on the white metal lozenge.
<name>Bilbo</name>	Bilbo	Bond	The light of the torch showed fresh masonry, and, twenty feet below, a glimmer of water. When [MASK] got to the bottom he found that the glimmer was a small stream running down a central gutter in the floor of an ancient stonewalled tunnel that sloped steeply up to the right.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Bond	‘But what is the object of the plot?’ [MASK] looked out into the darkness. He spoke to his reflection in the window. ‘What can they want to achieve? We always get back to that. Of course we have all smelt a conspiracy of some sort.
<name>Brian</name>	Brian	Kerims	A quarter of an hour. I hope you love animals,’ [MASK] laugh boomed hugely away up the tunnel. The rats scuffled and stirred. ‘Unfortunately there is not much choice. Rats and bats. Squadrons of them, divisions - a whole air force and army.
<name>Houdini</name>	Houdini	Bond	The complicated bag of tricks amused [MASK], but he also had to admit that, despite its eight-pound weight, the bag was a convenient way of carrying the tools of his trade, which otherwise would have to be concealed about his body.
<name>Grandma</name>	Grandma	Klebb	The old-fashioned black dress with the touch of lace at the throat and wrists, the thin gold chain that hung down over the shapeless bosom and ended in a folding lorgnette, the neat little feet in the sensible black-buttoned boots that barely touched the floor. It couldn’t be [MASK]!
<name>The protagonist</name>	The protagonist	Bond	He paid for it and walked out of the bar and up the steps to the concierge’s lodge. The concierge looked sharply at him and handed over a key. [MASK] walked over to the lift and got in and went up to the third floor.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Bond	The night breeze felt wonderfully cool on his naked body. He looked at his watch. It said two o’clock. [MASK] gave a shuddering yawn. He let the curtains drop back into place. He bent to switch off the lights on the dressing-table.
<name>Della</name>	Della	Mathis	From the point of its toe there slid forward half an inch of thin knife blade. Like the knitting needles, the steel had a dirty bluish tinge. The two men came up and put the big square basket down beside [MASK].
<name>Marconi</name>	Marconi	Kerim	She said she was going to get off there. [MASK] promised to get a signal off that night. She refused to make any arrangements for staying in touch. Just said that she would keep her end of the bargain if we would keep ours.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Kerim	Out of sheer pressure for space, the rats would have braved the lights and hurled themselves down on to the two intruders, in spite of the two glaring eyes and the threatening scent. ‘Watch,’ said [MASK]. There was a moment of silence.
<name>Leiter</name>	Leiter	Nash	And how did you know the code of the month?’ [MASK] said patiently, ‘You don’t seem to get the picture, old man. smersh is good - really good. There’s nothing better. We know your code of the month for every year.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	His instincts about this man had been right. It would be a question of somehow getting rid of him at the next station. Where had they got to? When would the frontier come? [MASK] lifted his wrist to look at the time.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	There was so obviously just room for him to slip under the single sheet and fit close up against her, the front of his thighs against the backs of hers, his head in the spread curtain of her hair on the pillow. [MASK] screwed up his eyes and opened them again.
<name>her mother's</name>	her mother's	Garbos	It must look terribly wide when she smiled. She smiled at herself in the mirror. Yes, it was wide; but then so had [MASK] been. At least the lips were full and finely etched. There was the hint of a smile at the corners.
<name>Spade</name>	Spade	Bond	[MASK]’s hand on the gun under his coat was taut as a steel spring. His half-closed eyes flickered round the room and back to the little old woman in the chair. Had he made a mistake? Was this the wrong room?
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Darko	But I’m not a fool, [MASK]. I’ve been watching for any clue, anything that would help. You know one can tell a lot when certain barriers are down. Well they are down, and I know she’s telling the truth.
<name>Mr. Nancy</name>	Mr. Nancy	Kerim	A fiercely attractive young girl in a thick old-fashioned black frock, with strings of gold coins round her neck and about ten thin gold bracelets on each wrist, came over from the table and swept a low jingling curtsey in front of [MASK].
<name>Natasha</name>	Natasha	Romanova	The man is in the position of a drug addict. He would no more abandon the Soviet Union than a drugger would abandon the source of his cocaine. He is my top executioner. There is no one better. ’ ‘And this girl, [MASK].
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Kerim	[MASK] chuckled. ‘He said that his judgment was right. You killed well. Now he wants you to take on those two women. ’ ‘Tell him even one of them would be too much for me. But tell him I think they are fine women.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bond	‘Here you are my friend! Now, at once, some raki. You must be exhausted after your sight-seeing. ’ He fired orders at the waiter. [MASK] sat down in a comfortable-armed chair and took the small tumbler the waiter offered him.
<name>Mrs. Hutchinson</name>	Mrs. Hutchinson	Tatiana	[MASK] sat back in her chair. So that was what it was all about! It really wasn’t so bad after all. What a relief! And what an honour to have been chosen. How silly to have been so frightened!
<name>James</name>	James	Bond	He knew that if a Russian spy was even a few minutes early or late for a rendezvous the rendezvous was automatically cancelled. He paid off the taxi and went through the door on the left that leads into the Ritz bar. [MASK] ordered a double vodka martini.
<name>James Bond</name>	James Bond	Kronsteen	Weakness for women (therefore not homosexual, thought [MASK]). Drinks (but nothing is said about drugs). Unbribable (who knows? There is a price for every man). No expense would be spared. All equipment and personnel available from all intelligence departments.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Bond	‘He says that you should not have asked him such a difficult favour. He says that your heart is too soft for a good fighter. But he says he will do what you ask. ’ The gipsy ignored [MASK]’s smile of thanks.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Monsieur	I am very glad to meet you at last. ’ The eyes had not changed. The harsh voice was patient and polite. The woman reached out her left hand towards the bell-push. ‘[MASK], I am afraid you are deranged.
<name>Patrick</name>	Patrick	Bond	The place looked like a butchers shop. How much blood did a body contain? He remembered. Ten pints. Well, it would soon all be there. As long as it didn’t spread into the passage! [MASK] stripped the bedclothes off the bottom bunk and set to work.
<name>James</name>	James	Bond	Yes, thought [MASK]. Yes. He was certainly right about that. The French papers would give it such a send-off there’d be no stopping it. They wouldn’t mind how far they went with the pictures or anything else.
<name>his lips</name>	his lips	Kerim	He lifted it towards [MASK] and tasted it. It was identical with ouzo. He drank it down. At once the waiter refilled his glass. ‘And now to order your lunch. They eat nothing but offal cooked in rancid olive oil in Turkey.
<name>Miss Ivors</name>	Miss Ivors	Bond	‘So why make things difficult for her? I am merely concerned with making things easy and comfortable for you so that you will at least enjoy your stay - even if it is fruitless. ’ [MASK] laughed. ‘I take it all back.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Tatiana	You will have to be careful, or I shall just eat all day long and sleep. You will beat me if I eat too much?’ ‘Certainly I will beat you. ’ [MASK] wrinkled her nose. He felt the soft caress of her ankles.
<name>James</name>	James	Bond	He had eaten a huge breakfast and had left the Embassy saying he would be back after lunch. [MASK] looked again at the time. He finished his martini. He paid for it and walked out of the bar and up the steps to the concierge’s lodge.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Bond	Had to know the answer before I told you what’s come up. It’s a pretty odd business. Be difficult to get you involved if you were on the edge of marrying or anything of that sort. ’ [MASK] shook his head, waiting for the story.
<name>Hercule</name>	Hercule	Kerim	‘I can’t think of anything. ’ [MASK] looked at his watch. ‘Twelve o’clock. Just time for the car to take you back to your hotel. There might be a message. And have a good look at your things to see if anyone has been inquisitive. ’
<name>Casey</name>	Casey	Kronsteen	The machine will go to the Special Devices section. They will handle its preparation. ’ [MASK] stopped talking. His gaze slowly came down from the ceiling. He rose thoughtfully to his feet. He looked across and into the watchful, intent eyes of the woman.
<name>Brett</name>	Brett	Zora	The light glinted off their heaving breasts and stomachs and off their hard, boyish flanks. Their feet left dark sweat marks on the white stones. Again it was the big girl, [MASK], who made the first move with a sudden forward leap and arms held out like a wrestlers.
<name>He</name>	He	Bond	A servant’s appearance and reactions - a glance through the open door. ‘Well, you’re wasting your time because he’s away,’ would be the obvious reception if the flat was empty. Should he tell the Security Section? [MASK] shrugged his shoulders irritably.
<name>The Swede</name>	The Swede	Nash	He felt naked without it. He said gruffly, ‘Bit on the light side, but it’ll kill if you put the bullets in the right places. ’ [MASK] nodded. He sat down near the window at the end of the bottom bunk.
<name>Lara</name>	Lara	Tatianas	As between girls. Do you enjoy making love? Does it give you pleasure? Much pleasure?’ [MASK] hands came up again and covered her face. From behind them, in a muffled voice, she said, ‘Well yes, Comrade Colonel.
<name>Robin</name>	Robin	James	‘Have no fear, [MASK],’ he said cheerfully. ‘We will defeat these people. Go to your girl. We will meet again in the morning. We shall not sleep much tonight, but that cannot be helped. Every day is different.
<name>McCarthy</name>	McCarthy	Troop	‘All intellectuals aren’t homosexual. And many of them are bald. I’m just saying that ...,’ and so the argument had gone on intermittently through the hearings of the past three days, and the other Committee members had ranged themselves more or less with [MASK].
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Tatiana	He went in and shut the door. She looked surprised. She had thought it was the conductor come to make up the beds. She smiled radiantly. ‘You have finished?’ ‘Sit down, [MASK]. I’ve got to talk to you. ’
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Kerim	The hair stirred softly on his head. Along the right-hand seat were two bodies. They were frozen in a ghastly death-struggle that might have been posed for a film. Underneath was [MASK], his knees up in a last effort to rise.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Kerim	‘Slow,’ said [MASK] softly. They crept round the square under the shadow of the lime trees. Down a street on the east side, the lighthouse below the Seraglio Palace gave them a great yellow wink. ‘Stop. ’
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bond	[MASK] felt for them in the pocket of his coat. He slipped off the bunk and knelt and forced them hard under the two doors. Then he settled himself again and switched off the reading light behind his head. The violet eye of the nightlight shone softly down.
<name>the President</name>	the President	M.	He had complimented his secretary on a new summer frock, and was half way through the file of signals that had come in during the night, when the red telephone that could only mean [MASK] or his Chief-of-Staff gave its soft, peremptory burr.
<name>He</name>	He	Grant	They could have given a hint. They generally do. ’ ‘This time they didn’t. ’ [MASK] walked slowly out through the glass door on to the lawn. If he noticed the girl sitting on the far edge of the pool he made no sign.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Bond	Now the eyes were opaque again - the eyes of an introvert, of a man who rarely looks out into the world but is for ever surveying the scene inside him. There’s madness there all right, thought [MASK], startled by the sight of it.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Bond	‘Listen, my friend,’ he put a huge hand on [MASK]’s shoulder. ‘This is a billiard table. An easy, flat, green billiard table. And you have hit your white ball and it is travelling easily and quietly towards the red.
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Kerim	But there I have my machine. We can get reinforcements if we need them. It should be a most interesting journey. There is always excitement on the Orient Express,’ [MASK] got to his feet. He opened the door, ‘and romance. ’
<name>Smiley</name>	Smiley	Grant	[MASK] put the telephone softly back on its cradle and sat looking at it. The bullet-headed guard standing over him said, ‘You had better start moving. ’ ‘Did they give you any idea of the task?’
<name>Myra</name>	Myra	Nash	Not a bad dividend on the side. ’ [MASK] chuckled dully. ‘And then the letter says that all she’s got to offer you is the machine and her body - and all about her body and what you did with it. Hot stuff, that part!
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Vida	But now [MASK]’s hands were free and they were scrabbling at the big girl’s body. The girls tore apart and backed away like cats, their shining bodies glinting through the last rags of their shifts and blood showing on the exposed breasts of the big girl.
<name>him</name>	him	Bond	Their radar is very good. ’ They set off up the steep slope. The smell of the rats and of the droppings of bats was thick - a mixture of monkey house and chicken battery. It occurred to [MASK] that it would be days before he got rid of it.
<name>Al Capone</name>	Al Capone	M.	The others in there are all my children. The chauffeur and the watchman are uncles of mine. Common blood is the best security. And this spice business is good cover for us all. [MASK] set me up in it.
<name>Miss Brodie</name>	Miss Brodie	Eighth	She walked straight down the long corridor and rang for the lift. When it came, she squared her shoulders and lifted her chin and walked into the lift as if it was the platform of the guillotine. ‘[MASK],’ she said to the girl operator.
<name>Ivanov</name>	Ivanov	Bond	The Director and his two colleagues were clear - serious dull Russian faces whose characteristics [MASK] filed away. There was the studious, professorial face of the Director - thick spectacles, lantern jaw, big forehead and thin hair brushed back.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Terrified	She had stopped flirting. ‘You’re not afraid?’ He saw a shadow cross her eyes. But it was not what he thought. She had remembered that she had a part to play. She was to be frightened of what she was doing. [MASK].
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Bond	There’s quite a swerve on this one. ’ As [MASK] put on his coat and went out into the corridor, banging the door behind him, he had a feeling of certainty that the starter’s gun had fired and that the dog days had come to an end.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Bond	‘You’ll do nothing of the sort,’ she had said coldly. Later she had kissed him goodbye with a sudden warmth, and for the hundredth time [MASK] had wondered why he bothered with other women when the most darling of them all was his secretary.
<name>The sniper</name>	The sniper	Bond	He aimed at their legs above the knees and the gun in his hand cracked twice. The two men fell, soundlessly, face downwards in the grass. Two bullets gone. Only six left. [MASK] edged closer to the fight.
<name>Trotsky</name>	Trotsky	Stolzenberg	The voice was hoarse and flat without emotion, ‘... resembles in some respects the case of [MASK]. If you remember, Comrade General, this also was a matter of destroying a reputation as well as a life. On that occasion the matter was simple.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Bond	204. [MASK] put his right hand inside his coat and on to the taped butt of the Beretta. It was tucked into the waistband of his trousers. He could feel the metal of the silencer warm across his stomach. He knocked once with his left hand.
<name>Miss Marple</name>	Miss Marple	Bond	[MASK] stared rudely into the woman’s face, examining it. It was an ugly face, toadlike, under the powder and under the tight cottage-loaf of white hair. The eyes were so light brown as to be almost yellow.
<name>Lenin</name>	Lenin	Lenin	Here was a chance for that big step forward. What would the medal be? The Order of [MASK]? He listened carefully. ‘The target is an English spy. You would like to kill an English spy?’ ‘Very much indeed, Comrade Colonel. ’
<name>Hagrid</name>	Hagrid	Bond	[MASK] could see one cold grey eye under a bushy eyebrow and a low forehead topped by wiry grey-brown hair. This man was the only one who was smoking. He puffed busily at a tiny wooden pipe in the bowl of which stood half a cigarette.
<name>Thor</name>	Thor	Grant	The great red-brown body with its golden hair lit up the drab room. [MASK] stood relaxed, his hands held loosely at his sides and one knee bent slightly forward, as if he was posing for an art class.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Bond	On it half a dozen young men and girls sat on high stools and wrote busily in fat, old-fashioned ledgers. It was like a Dickensian counting-house and [MASK] noticed that each high desk had a battered abacus beside the inkpot.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Bond	The youth turned and said, ‘Good evening, sir. ’ [MASK] recognized him as one of the clerks in the warehouse. He was as dark and lean as the head clerk, and his eyes also were blue. The car moved down the hill.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Kronsteen	It said, in the large typewritten characters he knew so well, ‘you are required this instant’. No signature and no address. [MASK] folded the paper and carefully placed it in his inside breast pocket. Later it would be recovered from him and destroyed.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Tatianas	We shall be separated. It will not always be like this in a little room. In a few days we shall have to step out into the world. It will not be easy. It would be foolish to tell you anything else. ’ [MASK] face cleared.
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Fie	Sometimes I feel guilty for not telling the authorities of this tunnel so that they can clean the place up. But I can’t so long as the Russians are up here. ’ [MASK] jerked his head at the roof. He looked at his watch.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Kronsteen	That will mean that he is not engaged on some operation. He will be available to go after our bait when they get the scent. Meanwhile,’ [MASK]’s dark, pensive eyes continued to examine a particular point on the ceiling, ‘I have been studying the suitability of centres abroad.
<name>Sasha</name>	Sasha	Tatiana	The woman paused. There was girlish conspiracy in the next question. ‘Are you a virgin, Comrade?’ Oh, my God, thought [MASK]. ‘No, Comrade Colonel. ’ The wet lips glinted in the light. ‘How many men?’
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Grant	‘Yes, Comrade Colonel. ’ [MASK] knew not to ask any questions. He scrambled into his clothes, indifferent to the woman’s eyes on him, and walked over to the door, buttoning his jacket. He turned. ‘Thank you, Comrade Colonel. ’
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Tatiana	The hard ones are square. ’ [MASK] murmured her thanks. She reached out and chose a round one. It would be easier to swallow. Her mouth was dry with fear of the moment when she would finally see the trap and feel it snap round her neck.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Bond	[MASK] decided to forget his prejudice. A gold signet ring, with an indecipherable crest, glinted on the little finger of the right hand that gripped the guard-rail. The corner of a red bandana handkerchief flopped out of the breast pocket of the man’s coat.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Nash	‘That’s what I thought, old man. ’ They had dinner. It was a silent meal. [MASK] sat beside the girl and kept his eyes on his plate. He held his knife like a fountain pen and frequently wiped it on his fork.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Kerim	Behind it was a small door, flush with the wall. [MASK] pressed one side of the door and it swung inwards to reveal a dark tunnel with stone steps leading straight down. A dank smell, mixed with a faint zoo stench, came out into the room.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Bond	The noise of the town was a distant rumble and it was quiet and peaceful. They walked across the gravel and through another small door and [MASK] found himself at one end of a great vaulted godown with high circular windows through which dusty bars of sunshine slanted across a vista of bundles and bales of merchandise.
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	james	‘His story confirms it. I will read out some extracts. Then we must decide. It is getting late. ’ He turned back to the first page and began to rattle off the points that struck him. ‘First name: [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Bond	[MASK]’s thoughts were interrupted by the stewardess. ‘Fasten your seat-belts, please. ’ As she spoke the plane dropped sicken-ingly and soared up again with an ugly note of strain in the scream of the jets. The sky outside was suddenly black.
