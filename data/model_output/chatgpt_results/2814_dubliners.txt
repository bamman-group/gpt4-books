<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Eveline	Then she would be married—she, [MASK]. People would treat her with respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father’s violence.
<name>Strickland</name>	Strickland	Corley	[MASK] did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Corley	Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front steps and coughed. [MASK] turned and went towards her. His broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Gabriel	She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto. When they had taken their places she said abruptly: “I have a crow to pluck with you.” “With me?” said [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gretta	When the others had gone away, when he and she were in their room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly: “[MASK]!” Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Mahony	The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head. I was very happy. When I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw [MASK]’s grey suit approaching.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Routh	How much had he written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last tricks, talking and gesticulating. [MASK] won. The cabin shook with the young men’s cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began then to gather in what they had won.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Gabriel	The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning. “Eight,” said [MASK].
<name>Mr. Henchy</name>	Mr. Henchy	Joe	But [MASK] said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again.
<name>He</name>	He	Lenehan	His features were composed in stern calm. [MASK] kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice. “Can’t you tell us?” he said. “Did you try her?”
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Corley	“Of all the good ones ever I heard,” he said, “that emphatically takes the biscuit.” [MASK]’s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Polly	[MASK] sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Leo	Every evening after school we met in his back garden and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother [MASK], the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mahony	When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands, laughing, and [MASK] said: “Till tomorrow, mates!” That night I slept badly. In the morning I was first-comer to the bridge as I lived nearest.
<name>Truant</name>	Truant	Dillon	I’m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could understand it if you were ... National School boys. Now, [MASK], I advise you strongly, get at your work or....”
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Tommy	I say, [MASK], don’t make punch of that whisky: liquor up.” “No, really....” “O, come on, another one won’t do you any harm. What is it? The same again, I suppose?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gabriel	She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. [MASK] smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair.
<name>Mr. Brocklehurst</name>	Mr. Brocklehurst	Martin	He’s a man of the world like ourselves.” “Ah, ... yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall.” “That’s the man.” “And tell me, [MASK].... Is he a good preacher?”
<name>Mrs. Reed</name>	Mrs. Reed	Gabriel	The window was so wet I couldn’t see so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.” “And did you not tell him to go back?” asked [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Gabriel	“What for?” Her eyes made [MASK] feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said: “How do I know? To see him, perhaps.” She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence.
<name>Mr. Hyde</name>	Mr. Hyde	Gallaher	A trifle made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small whiskies had gone to his head and [MASK]’s strong cigar had confused his mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person.
<name>Basil</name>	Basil	Gabriel	He was very delicate.” [MASK] was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy. “I can see him so plainly,” she said after a moment. “Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes!
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Gabriel	Her face, healthier than her sister’s, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour. They both kissed [MASK] frankly.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Hogan	And, after all, it’s the old country, as they say, isn’t it? You can’t help having a certain feeling for it. That’s human nature.... But tell me something about yourself. [MASK] told me you had ... tasted the joys of connubial bliss.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Lenehan	I used to spend money on them right enough,” he added, in a convincing tone, as if he was conscious of being disbelieved. But [MASK] could well believe it; he nodded gravely. “I know that game,” he said, “and it’s a mug’s game.”
<name>Charlotte</name>	Charlotte	Gabriel	She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler. [MASK] had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.
<name>Phoebe</name>	Phoebe	Maria	She was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace. One day the matron had said to her: “[MASK], you are a veritable peace-maker!” And the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment.
<name>Farrington</name>	Farrington	Crofton	Between ourselves, you know, [MASK] (he’s a decent chap, of course), but he’s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn’t a word to throw to a dog. He stands and looks at the people while I do the talking.”
<name>Mr. Fitzpatrick</name>	Mr. Fitzpatrick	Gabriel	To follow the voice, without looking at the singer’s face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. [MASK] applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table.
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Reynolds	He still bought a copy of [MASK]’s Newspaper every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down on; it was not that. But the family would look down on her.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Frank	He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness. [MASK] would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save her.
<name>George</name>	George	Gabriel	I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” “Why should I be ashamed of myself?” asked [MASK], blinking his eyes and trying to smile.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jack	They saluted coldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw [MASK] regarding him from the door of the return-room.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Gabriel	A ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. [MASK] threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little.
<name>Plato</name>	Plato	Shakespeare	His blade of human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like [MASK]’s.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Gallaher	and it seemed to him unjust. [MASK] was his inferior in birth and education. He was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or could ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance.
<name>Mrs. Smith</name>	Mrs. Smith	Annie	When he brought the blouse home [MASK] kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it.
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Maria	He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young. [MASK] agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Farrington	[MASK] pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands.
<name>Shakespeare</name>	Shakespeare	Shakespeare	Some quotation that they would recognise from [MASK] or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men’s heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Gabriel	The smile passed away from [MASK]’s face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins. “Someone you were in love with?” he asked ironically.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Joe	In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would have, all the children singing! Only she hoped that [MASK] wouldn’t come in drunk.
<name>the Hungarian</name>	the Hungarian	Villona	His father, therefore, was unusually friendly with [MASK] and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner. The dinner was excellent, exquisite.
<name>Zephyrin</name>	Zephyrin	Mahony	I was still considering whether I would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us again. Hardly had he sat down when [MASK], catching sight of the cat which had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Charlie	They had five children. A little boy came running down the stairs. “Who is that?” said the man, peering through the darkness. “Me, pa.” “Who are you? [MASK]?” “No, pa.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Corley	His eyes searched the street: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons. Would [MASK] do a thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Corley	When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house. [MASK] remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. Some minutes passed.
<name>Miss Smith</name>	Miss Smith	Kathleen	She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which [MASK] was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts.
<name>Beethoven</name>	Beethoven	Mozart	His evenings were spent either before his landlady’s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city. His liking for [MASK]’s music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert: these were the only dissipations of his life. He had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Corley	The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. [MASK] was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father’s frame and gait.
<name>Davy Byrne</name>	Davy Byrne	Corley	His mind became active again. He wondered had [MASK] managed it successfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave it to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend’s situation as well as those of his own.
<name>the witness</name>	the witness	Lennon	She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated [MASK] from all blame.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Frank	Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. “I know these sailor chaps,” he said. One day he had quarrelled with [MASK] and after that she had to meet her lover secretly.
<name>Agnes</name>	Agnes	Eliza	“And was that it?” said my aunt. “I heard something....” [MASK] nodded. “That affected his mind,” she said. “After that he began to mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself.
<name>Dick</name>	Dick	Lily	“Tell me, [MASK],” he said in a friendly tone, “do you still go to school?” “O no, sir,” she answered. “I’m done schooling this year and more.”
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Maria	and [MASK], blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice. She sang I Dreamt that I Dwelt, and when she came to the second verse she sang again: I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side And of all who assembled within those walls
<name>Mr. Bingley</name>	Mr. Bingley	Gabriel	“But yet,” continued [MASK], his voice falling into a softer inflection, “there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight.
<name>Mr. Wopsle</name>	Mr. Wopsle	Gabriel	“Round and round he went,” said [MASK], “and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. ‘Go on, sir! What do you mean, sir?
<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Dillon	“This page or this page? This page? Now, [MASK], up! ‘Hardly had the day’.... Go on! What day? ‘Hardly had the day dawned’.... Have you studied it? What have you there in your pocket?”
<name>Mr. Utterson</name>	Mr. Utterson	Eliza	You could see that.” A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair in the corner. [MASK] seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.
<name>Phileas Fogg</name>	Phileas Fogg	Jimmy	The street was busy with unusual traffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram-drivers. Near the Bank Ségouin drew up and [MASK] and his friend alighted. A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor.
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Gabriel	[MASK] watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before.
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Lenehan	“But tell me,” said [MASK] again, “are you sure you can bring it off all right? You know it’s a ticklish job. They’re damn close on that point. Eh?... What?” His bright, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance.
<name>Mr. Power</name>	Mr. Power	Ségouin	It was a serious thing for him. Of course, the investment was a good one and [MASK] had managed to give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of Irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern.
<name>Rochester</name>	Rochester	Frank	She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! [MASK] would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness.
<name>Mrs. Joe</name>	Mrs. Joe	Ada	[MASK]!” His wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk. They had five children. A little boy came running down the stairs. “Who is that?”
<name>Tessie</name>	Tessie	Frank	[MASK] rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Gabriel	But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.” “And did he go home?” asked [MASK]. “Yes, he went home.
<name>Lennie</name>	Lennie	Corley	“I told her I was out of a job,” said [MASK]. “I told her I was in Pim’s. She doesn’t know my name. I was too hairy to tell her that. But she thinks I’m a bit of class, you know.”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gretta	He stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly: “[MASK], dear, what are you thinking about?” She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm.
<name>Polly</name>	Polly	Lily	Though their life was modest they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But [MASK] seldom made a mistake in the orders so that she got on well with her three mistresses.
<name>Myrtle</name>	Myrtle	Lenehan	She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards. [MASK]’s eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Corley	He knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to amuse, and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task. The problem of how he could pass the hours till he met [MASK] again troubled him a little.
<name>Mabel</name>	Mabel	Lily	[MASK], the caretaker’s daughter, did housemaid’s work for them. Though their life was modest they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout.
<name>Thomas</name>	Thomas	Florentines	His conversation was mainly about himself: what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of [MASK].
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Joe	I had riches too great to count, could boast Of a high ancestral name, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still the same. But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song [MASK] was very much moved.
<name>Corley</name>	Corley	Mahony	“That’s forfeit,” said [MASK]. “And so much the better for us—a bob and a tanner instead of a bob.” We walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works and then turned to the right along the Wharf Road.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Mahony	[MASK] began to play the Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we should charge them.
<name>Theodore</name>	Theodore	Gabriel	[MASK] took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Harry	Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably. She always gave her entire wages—seven shillings—and [MASK] always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Gabriel	The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted too on the steps below him. In the silence [MASK] could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.
<name>The Fat Director</name>	The Fat Director	Gabriel	There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers. [MASK] began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Gabriel	She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him. “You are a very generous person, [MASK],” she said.
<name>Bridie</name>	Bridie	Maria	They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans. [MASK] superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Jack	You’ve kept him late enough as it is.” My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: “All work and no play makes [MASK] a dull boy.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mahony	My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before [MASK] saw me and hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me!
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	EVELINE	The upper part of the hall was now completely dark. Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger. [MASK] She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.
<name>Corney Keller</name>	Corney Keller	Weathers	After a long struggle [MASK] again brought his opponent’s hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity: “Ah!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Farley	whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. [MASK] clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were! Cards! cards!
<name>Mr. Gatsby</name>	Mr. Gatsby	Gabriel	Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and [MASK] pushed back his chair. The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	James	Ah, poor [MASK]!” She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said shrewdly: “Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly. Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Eliza	You wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know he’s gone and all to that....” “It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt. “I know that,” said [MASK].
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Corley	In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road; he heard [MASK]’s voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman’s mouth. This vision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit.
<name>Mr. Duffy</name>	Mr. Duffy	Eliza	His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room—the flowers. We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we found [MASK] seated in his arm-chair in state.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Gabriel	[MASK], leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Gabriel	[MASK], trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness.
<name>He</name>	He	Joe	At the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright. But [MASK] said it didn’t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was very nice with her.
<name>Alice</name>	Alice	Mahony	We could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each. Refreshed by this, [MASK] chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide field.
<name>Edmund</name>	Edmund	Gabriel	She’s not the girl she was at all.” [MASK] was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Tom	While the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle, he called out: “Hallo, [MASK], old man! What’s the trouble?”
