<name>Thrain</name>	Thrain	Therem	He stopped in the doorway and was still, staring at the man who lay in his blood across the hearth. Then he entered in haste, and made a bed of furs that he took out of an old chest, and built up a fire, and cleaned [MASK]’s wounds and bound them.
<name>He</name>	He	Estraven	It seemed to me that it would not matter much if it did, as the difference between little and nothing seemed a rather fine one. [MASK], however, was on the track of his luck, following what appeared to be hunch or intuition, but may have been applied experience and reasoning.
<name>Tit-for-tat</name>	Tit-for-tat	shifgrethor	You remember him, perhaps?” Anger had displaced timidity, and he was going to play [MASK] with me. If I wanted to play, my move was to say something like, “I’m not sure; tell me something about him.”
<name>Yossarian</name>	Yossarian	Ethwen	—All but one, there, too long to hide, a dark face like a skull, eyes'shut and sunken, a mat of long, fibrous hair. The luck that had turned in [MASK] now turned the world with it under my hand.
<name>Bayaz</name>	Bayaz	Argaven	They won’t miss.” “And how many of them are there—eleven? Is that right?” “Yes. Not enough to be afraid of, my lord.” [MASK]’s hands twitched in an unfinished gesture.
<name>Roland</name>	Roland	Estraven	In all other respects it seemed perfectly insane. I kept my opinion to myself, for I fully meant what I'd said about preferring to die escaping, if it came down to a choice of deaths. [MASK], however, was still exploring alternatives.
<name>Stebbins</name>	Stebbins	Harth	Though I don’t suppose [MASK] much cares where he is so long as he can keep on wriggling towards some kind of power. He hasn’t done so badly here, in five months, as you see.” “Not so badly.”
<name>Hunding</name>	Hunding	Shath	The other told him that [MASK] fared ill. Nothing prospered there in hearth or tilth, all being blighted with illness, the spring seed frozen in the ground or the ripe grain rotten, and so it had been for many years.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Genry	“I mean it,” I insisted. “First things first.” “I thank you, [MASK],” he said. His voice, when he spoke very softly as now, did have much the timbre of a woman’s voice, husky and unresonant.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Ai	My voice shook as I said the lines, for I remembered as I said them that in the letter my brother wrote me before his death he had quoted the same words. [MASK] brooded, and after some time he said, “You’re isolated, and undivided.
<name>Gethenians</name>	Gethenians	Gethenians	Being so strictly defined and limited by nature, the sexual urge of [MASK] is really not much interfered with by society: there is less coding, channeling, and repressing of sex there than in any bisexual society I know of. Abstinence is entirely voluntary; indulgence is entirely acceptable.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Estraven	This time there was no strangeness in my waking, but a grateful sense of peace. Sitting up I yawned and tried to comb back my matted hair with my fingers. I looked at [MASK], stretched out sound asleep on his sleeping-bag a couple of feet from me.
<name>Yahyah</name>	Yahyah	Haharath	He saw the others stirring and awakening, and was afraid of them when they moved, so he killed one after another with a blow of his fist. Thirty-six of them he killed. But one of them, the next to last one, ran away. [MASK] he was called.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Obsle	That was [MASK]. “Yes.” I omitted mention for the present of my little relay satellite, set into orbit from the rocket; I did not want to give them the impression that their sky was full of my junk.
<name>Yakov</name>	Yakov	Ai	No one knows he is here. I ask my fellow-workers at the factory; they know nothing and think I am talking of some crazy Yo-mesh sectarian. No information, no interest, nothing that might advance [MASK]’s cause, or protect his life.
<name>Demosthenes</name>	Demosthenes	Obsle	But [MASK] had my ansible; still has it, I suppose.” “Can he use it?” “No. Not even by chance, fiddling about. The coordinate-settings are extremely complex. But if only I’d used it!”
<name>Tristram</name>	Tristram	Estraven	He also explained [MASK]’s behavior, shrewdly enough, as that of a man once powerful and now fallen, who grasps at any chance to influence persons or events—always less rationally, more desperately, as time passes and he knows himself sinking into powerless anonymity.
<name>Estraven</name>	Estraven	Harth	I said at last after a direct rebuff, “[MASK], I’ve said something wrong again, please tell me what it is.” He was silent. “I’ve made some mistake in shifgrethor. I’m sorry; I can’t learn.
<name>Marlow</name>	Marlow	Therem	“How is your luck running, [MASK]?” I said at last. He did not smile at that. Nor did he answer. Only after a while he said, “I’ve been thinking about them all, down there.”
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Faxe	We were strolling side by side, and [MASK] looked at me. His face, one of the most beautiful human faces I ever saw, seemed hard and delicate as carved stone. “In the darkness,” he said, “there were ten; not nine.
<name>Stanton</name>	Stanton	Estraven	There among the mountains, [MASK] reasoned, we should be able to get onto the surface of the ice-sheet, either descending onto it from a mountain-slope or climbing up to it on the slope of one of its effluent glaciers.
<name>Trurl</name>	Trurl	Estraven	But I have a question before we get in harness, [MASK]. You have my hood down over my eyes entirely. Now tell me: what was all this obscuration, obfuscation and fiddlefaddle concerning an Envoy from the far side of the moon?”
<name>Amundsen</name>	Amundsen	Estraven	It was good to be released from forever pulling and pushing and hauling and prying that sledge, and I said so to [MASK] as we went on. He glanced back at the sledge, a bit of refuse in the vast torment of ice and reddish rock.
<name>Ged</name>	Ged	Meshe	In the answering of the Question of the Lord of Shorth, in the moment of the Seeing, [MASK] saw all the sky as if it were all one sun. Above the earth and under the earth all the sphere of sky was bright as the sun’s surface, and there was no darkness.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Arek	I wrote to my son tonight, a long letter. While writing it I had again and again a sense of [MASK]’s presence, as if I should see him if I turned. Why do I keep such notes as these? For nfy son to read?
<name>Estraven</name>	Estraven	Ai	We have both been down a good deal. I slid fifteen feet on my belly across one such slick. [MASK], in harness, doubled up laughing. He apologized and explained he had thought himself the only person on Gethen who ever slipped on ice.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Estraven	We loaded up and were off as the sun gilded the tops of the scrubby bushes rimming the dell, [MASK] pulling in harness and I as pusher and rudder at the stem. The snow was beginning to get a crust on it; on clear downslopes we went like a dog-team, at a run.
<name>London</name>	London	Ehrenrang	As I was putting on my coat in the hallway he said, “I’ve lost my chance for the present, for I suppose you’ll be leaving [MASK]—” why did he suppose so?—“but I trust a day will come when I can ask you questions again.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Genry	It will add some miles to our way, though — something between twenty and fifty, I should think. What’s your opinion, [MASK]?” “My opinion is that I can’t go twenty more feet so long as the white weather lasts.”
<name>Osric</name>	Osric	Tibe	All the good of his reign had been done by his ministers and the kyorremy. But he had not done much harm. His wrestles with his own nightmares had not damaged the kingdom. His cousin [MASK] was another kind of fish, for his insanity had logic.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Ai	for “fences” I turned that switch to cut the current to the outermost defenses of the Farm, and then went on, pulling [MASK] along now by the shoulders. I came by the guard on duty in the watch-room by the door.
<name>Macomber</name>	Macomber	Estraven	“[MASK] would be a good man to pull with, on a crazy trek like that. He was tough as iron. And never lost his temper. I’m sorry he’s dead.” I found no reply. “I’ll receive your . . .
<name>George</name>	George	Estraven	We had enough of it to last us sixty days at the minimal standard ration: a pound a day apiece. After he had washed up and eaten, [MASK] sat a long time by the stove that night figuring out precisely what we had and how and when we must use it.
<name>Envoy</name>	Envoy	Karhide	A noble plan, and it will not be followed. They will not ask [MASK] to join them in anything. The Sarf’B men among the Thirty-Three of course oppose any consideration at all of the Envoy’s presence and mission.
<name>Zeus</name>	Zeus	Meshe	No raindrop falls in the storms of autumn that ever fell before, and the rain has fallen, and falls, and will fall throughout all the autumns of the years. [MASK] saw each drop, where it fell, and falls, and will fall.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	God!—by	I never thought about it much in the abstract, you know, and—[MASK] now I’ve practically forgotten. I've been here two years. . . . You don’t know. In a sense, women are more alien to me than you are.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Estraven	“Come along out of this, [MASK],” he said in the high, loud, nasal voice of the Mishnory rich. “Oh, leave the dammed shirt.” “I haven’t got another.” “Fish it out of that soup then and come on.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Goss	Though the technique is the exact opposite of most techniques of mysticism it probably is a mystical discipline, tend- ing towards the experience of Immanence; but I can’t categorize any practice of the Handdarata with certainty. [MASK] spoke to the person in scarlet.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Ai	[MASK] taught me a Terran game played on squares with little stones, called go, an excellent difficult game. As he remarked, there are plenty of stones here to play go with. He endures the cold pretty well, and if courage were enough, would stand it like a snow-worm.
<name>Umslopogaas</name>	Umslopogaas	Genly	He indicated me to her, and she came and took my right hand in the fashion of my people, looking into my face. “Oh, [MASK],” she said, “I didn’t know you!” It was strange to hear a woman’s voice, after so long.
<name>Hain</name>	Hain	Ollul	“Oh, yes. I could speak to [MASK] by ansible and ask them to send a NAFAL ship to pick me up. It would get here in seventeen years. Or I could radio to the Star Ship that brought me into your solar system.
<name>Laughing</name>	Laughing	Cooled	“Hearth-brothers, or friends,” he said, and saying it was remote, out of reach, two feet from me in a tent eight feet across. No answer to that. What is more arrogant than honesty? [MASK], I climbed into my fur bag.
<name>Beowulf</name>	Beowulf	Estraven	And if it was I would not understand it. “Did you hear what the king said to me at the ceremony today?” “No.” [MASK] leaned forward across the hearth, lifted the beer-jug out of the hot ashes, and refilled my tankard.
<name>Yudhishthira</name>	Yudhishthira	Meshe	Nothing is unseen. The poor man of Sheney came to [MASK] lamenting that he had not food to give the child of his flesh, nor grain to sow, for the rains had rotted the seed in the ground and all the folk of his hearth starved.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Estraven	True in part; an aspect of the truth. It would be no less true to say that [MASK]’s acts had risen out of pure personal loyalty, a sense of responsibility and friendship towards one single human being, myself. Nor would that be the whole truth.
<name>Shevek</name>	Shevek	Estraven	“I’m a friend of one who befriended you,” he said, with the brusqueness of the timid. “I’ve come to ask you a favor, for his sake.” “You mean Faxe—?” “No. [MASK].”
<name>Amundsen</name>	Amundsen	Estraven	The sledge-meter, ignoring the hard uphill work we had done all day, said we had come only nine miles. “First day we’ve done less than our stint,” I said. [MASK] nodded, and neatly cracked a legbone for the marrow.
<name>Ootek</name>	Ootek	Estraven	[MASK] had had to guess my size and the snow-boots he got me were a little large, but extra socks filled the discrepancy. We put on our skis, got into harness as quick as possible, bucked and pried and jolted the sledge free if its runners were frozen in, and set off.
<name>Oates</name>	Oates	Estraven	[MASK] was not so worried as I by the hundreds of miles that still lay ahead of us. “The sledge is lighter,” he said. “Towards the end it will be still fighter; and we can cut rations, if necessary.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Genry	You Handdarata have a gift that men on every world have craved. You have it. You can predict the future. And yet you live like the rest of us—it doesn’t seem to matter—” “How should it matter, [MASK]?”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Estraven	When it would not be shut up I argued with it, asserting that I could get on without [MASK]—perhaps better than with him. After all, my job here was a one-man job. There is only one First Mobile.
<name>Alveron</name>	Alveron	Argaven	[MASK] was less kingly, less manly, than he looked at a distance among his courtiers. His voice was thin, and he held his fierce lunatic head at an angle of bizarre arrogance. “My lord, what I have to say is gone out of my head.
<name>Ansset</name>	Ansset	Therem	“I dreamed,” he said, “I thought I was at home—” “You heard me mindspeak.” “You called me— It was my brother. It was his voice I heard. He’s dead. You called me—you called me [MASK]?
<name>Ranulph</name>	Ranulph	Estraven	On the fortieth day and the two succeeding we were snowed in by a blizzard. During these long hours of lying blotto in the tent [MASK] slept almost continuously, and ate nothing, though he drank orsh or sugar-water at mealtimes. He insisted that I eat.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Argaven	[MASK] smiled at that, a stretched, staring grin. He laughed shrilly like an angry woman pretending to be amused. “Damn him,” he said, “the proud, posturing, perjuring traitor! You dined with him last night, eh?
<name>Therem</name>	Therem	Edondurath	Does he bum?” All the other corpses would say with frozen tongues, “No, no.” Then [MASK] entered kemmer as he slept, and moved and spoke aloud in dreams, and when he woke the corpses were all saying, “He bums!
<name>Strelkov</name>	Strelkov	Karhide	“We must halt this rivalry with [MASK] before the New Men come,” he says. “We must cleanse our spirits for their coming. We must forego shifgrethor, forbid all acts of vengeance, and unite together without envy as brothers of one Hearth.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Estraven	“Will you look to my friend?” I thought I had said it, but [MASK] had. Somebody was making me sit down. They brought us food; they looked after us, took us in, welcomed us home.
<name>Hardin</name>	Hardin	Obsle	But I cannot bring down the ship until its safety and your integrity are reasonably secure. I need the consent and the guarantee of your government, which I take it would mean the whole board of Commensals — publicly announced.” [MASK] looked dour, but said, “Fair enough.”
<name>Shevek</name>	Shevek	Faxe	“The unknown,” said [MASK]’s soft voice in the forest, “the unforetold, the unproven, that is what life is based on. Ignorance is the ground of thought. Unproof is the ground of action. If it were proven that there is no God there would be no religion.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Faxe	[MASK] raised his hand. At once each face in the circle turned to him as if he had gathered up their gazes into a sheaf, a skein. It had been afternoon and raining when we entered the hall. The gray light had soon died out of the slit-windows under the eaves.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Genry	He said, “We must soon be going on from here, [MASK].” I remember him standing there in the shadows of the firelit room barefoot and wearing nothing but the loose fur breeches the chief had given him.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Estraven	Away off in the southwest shone the yellow glimmer of a small town, some tiny Commensal Village of Orgoreyn, where [MASK] could go with his unacceptable identification papers and be assured at least of a night’s lodging in the Commensal Jail or perhaps on the nearest Commensal Voluntary Farm.
<name>Thorne</name>	Thorne	Obsle	They are astute men, and have their faction well in hand. Only seven of the Thirty-Three are reliable Open Traders; of the rest, [MASK] thinks to gain the sure support of ten, giving a bare majority.
<name>Asriel</name>	Asriel	Faxe	[MASK] sat cross-legged, not moving, but charged, full of a gathering force that made his light, soft voice crack like an electric bolt. “Ask,” he said. I stood within the circle and asked my question.
<name>Alia</name>	Alia	Faxe	“That’s a discipline that must arouse the interest of kings, politicians, men of business.” “Men of business fought against the use of mind-speech when it first was found to be a teachable skill; they outlawed it for decades.” [MASK] smiled.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Estraven	We entered into a big steaming-hot bright-lit room full of food and the smells of food, and people and the voices of people. I caught hold of [MASK]’s shoulder. Strange faces turned to us, strange eyes.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ashe	And feeling that unavailing bond close on me anew, I was angry; for [MASK]’s love had always forced me to act against my heart. I went on past him. If I must be cruel no need to hide it, pretending kindness.
<name>Prendick</name>	Prendick	Argaven	Still laughing and still snarling [MASK] came up close and stared straight at me. The dark irises of his eyes glowed slightly orange. I was a good deal more afraid of him than I had expected to be. I could see no course to follow among these incoherencies but that of candor.
<name>Hitler</name>	Hitler	Orgoreyn	“I was after what you’re after: the alliance of my world with your worlds. What did you think?” We were staring at each other across the glowing stove like a pair of wooden dolls. “You mean, even if it was [MASK] that made the alliance—?”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Estraven	Then I felt like crying, but refrained. [MASK] was not as strong as I was, and it would not be fair, it might make him cry too. He was already asleep: he had fallen asleep sitting up, his bowl on his lap.
<name>Stavrogin</name>	Stavrogin	Estraven	Nothing succeeds like success. I don’t trust [MASK], whose motives are forever obscure; I don’t like him; yet I feel and respond to his authority as surely as I do to the warmth of the sun.
<name>Aschenbach</name>	Aschenbach	Faxe	The fire had burned down long since and there was no light but those strips and slants of dimness creeping across the circle, sketching out a face, a hand, a moveless back. For a while I saw [MASK]’s profile rigid as pale stone in a diffuse dust of light.
<name>Yllan</name>	Yllan	Osboth	“The unexpected is what makes life possible,” he said. “I was entrusted with a message for you.” He looked inquiring. “It takes the form of money—some of your own— Foreth rem ir [MASK] sends it.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Karhidish	The whispers in the dark, random and soft, in the sinuous Orgota language that made [MASK] sound like rocks rattled in a can, ceased little by little. People slept. A baby fretted a while, away off in the dark, crying at the echo of its own cries.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Argaven	When the tape was recorded I pulled it out and gave it to [MASK]. He dropped it on the table, walked again to the central fireplace, almost into it, and kicked the flaming logs and beat down the sparks with his hands.
<name>Olaf</name>	Olaf	Thessicher	” We had kept the Chabe stove, the only thing of value left to us. It served us, one way or another, right to the end of our journey. The morning after our arrival at [MASK]’s farm, I took the stove and skied into town.
<name>Alveron</name>	Alveron	Estraven	They stared, and peered, and all the voices had fallen silent. [MASK] spoke, a barely audible whisper." We ask the hospitality of the Domain.” Noise, buzz, confusion, alarm, welcome.
<name>Shadow</name>	Shadow	Getheren	I speak and am not heard. I come and am not welcomed. There is no place by the fire for me, nor food on the table for me, nor a bed made for me to lie in. Yet I still have my name: [MASK] is my name.
<name>Genly</name>	Genly	Estraven	Their vulnerability weighed on [MASK]’s mind, before I had even thought of it. On our third night there he came into my room to discuss our next move. A Karhidish village is like an ancient castle of Earth in having few or no separate, private dwellings.
<name>Yoss</name>	Yoss	Estraven	But I can’t say that gratitude was my motive for infringing on the Law of Cultural Embargo. I was not paying my debt to him. Such debts remain owing. [MASK] and I had simply arrived at the point where we shared whatever we had that was worth sharing.
<name>Compare</name>	Compare	Compare	So they have gone very slowly. At any one point in their history a hasty observer would say that all technological progress and diffusion had ceased. Yet it never has. [MASK] the torrent and the glacier. Both get where they are going.
<name>Ransom</name>	Ransom	Getheren	He saw away over the ice to the north a white tower like the tower of a Domain, and from this place far away one came walking towards him. After a while [MASK] could see that the person was naked, his skin was all white, and his hair was all white.
<name>Wormold</name>	Wormold	Cliche	[MASK] came ready to his lips, but his mind was elsewhere. He brooded. I imagined him moving me around with the other pawns in his power-game. “You came to my country,” he said at last, “at a strange time.
<name>Jakt</name>	Jakt	Estraven	I tried sending to [MASK] while he slept, recalling what my Educer had told me about the occurrence of “dream-messages” among pre-telepathic peoples, but it did not work. “Perhaps my species lacks the capacity,” he said.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Getheren	[MASK] took off his gloves and looked at his hands. They were white as the snow. Yet the frostbite was gone out of them, and he could use his fingers, and stand upon his feet. He felt no pain, and no cold, and no hunger.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Estraven	I am not used to doing so. I am not used to giving, or accepting, either advice or blame.” “I don’t mean to be unjust, [MASK]—” “Yet you are. It is strange. I am the only man in
<name>Kim</name>	Kim	Ai	These three days since we came down from the pass have been much hard work for no gain, but [MASK] is no longer downcast, nor overhopeful; and he has more patience with me. Maybe the drugs are sweated out of him. Maybe we have learned to pull together.
<name>Yevgeny</name>	Yevgeny	Mersen	Some of the Open Trade crowd, I mean. Of course he was useful to them when he was in the kyorremy and Prime Minister, so they stand by him now. Mainly they do it to annoy [MASK], I think. Ha, ha!
<name>Yaldabaoth</name>	Yaldabaoth	Meshe	Therefore those that call upon the darkness** are made fools of and spat out from the mouth of [MASK], for they name what is not, calling it Source and End. There is neither source nor end, for all things are in the Center of Time.
<name>Zaphod</name>	Zaphod	Ai	And yet when he says “I am from outer space” some of you actually shut your eyes, abase your intellects, and believe! Never could I have thought it possible, etc., etc. To judge by the tape, [MASK] withstood gibes and assaults with patience.
<name>Lyra</name>	Lyra	Gethen	“As for [MASK], what I’m curious about is whether the rest of us may find ourselves to have the capacity for Foretelling—whether this too is a part of the evolution of the mind—if you’ll teach us the techniques.”
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Harth	Physically they’re less muscular, but a little more durable than men. Psychologically—” After he had stared a long time at the glowing stove, he shook his head. “[MASK],” he said, “I can’t tell you what women are like.
<name>Thurstan</name>	Thurstan	Slose	As supper was served promptly I postponed my questions and attended to a gummy fish soup and to my host and fellow guests. [MASK] was a frail, youngish person, with unusually light, bright eyes and a muted, intense voice; he looked like an idealist, a dedicated soul.
<name>Alvin</name>	Alvin	Asra	“No, this I’m telling of isn’t a spirit-world. A real one. The people that live on it are real people, alive, just like here. But very-long-ago they learned how to fly.” [MASK] grinned.
<name>Werner</name>	Werner	Estraven	Around midday [MASK] dozed off for a while, but I was too hungry and too cold for sleep; I lay there beside my friend in a sort of stupor, trying to remember the words he had quoted to me once: Two are one, life and death, lying together....
<name>Trimalchio</name>	Trimalchio	Obsle	cries [MASK], fattening out like a great hob-fish—“Haven’t I spent every hour of the past month on this business? Good faith! He expects us to believe whatever he tells us, and then doesn’t trust us in return!” “Should he?”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Estraven	“When will it come?” When I realized that I did not even know what day of the month it was, I began to realize how badly off I had in fact been, lately. I had to count back to the day before [MASK]’s death.
<name>Orual</name>	Orual	Estraven	“This will take a month’s believing,” he said. “And if it came from anyone’s mouth but yours, [MASK], I’d believe it to be pure hoax, a net for our pride woven out of starshine. But I know your stiff neck.
<name>Thorn</name>	Thorn	Estraven	[MASK] was an old man, past seventy, crippled by an arthritic disease of the hips. He sat erect in a rolling-chair by the fire. His face was broad, much blunted and worn down by time, like a rock in a torrent: a calm face, terribly calm.
