<name>he</name>	he	Maxim	We would stand on common ground. I should not be afraid. Anger and jealousy were things that could be conquered. One day the woman would grow old or tired or different, and [MASK] would not love her any more.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Favell	The church clock struck six o'clock. [MASK] began to speak. His voice was diffident, careless, but his face was still grey. He did not look at any of us, he kept glancing down at his cigarette and turning it over in his fingers.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maxim	He had been hiding in the woods that night. He had seen [MASK] take the boat from the moorings, and pull back in the dinghy, alone. I knew all the colour was draining away from my face. I leant back against the cushion of the chair.
<name>Mother</name>	Mother	Maxim	She was silent for a while, and drove without speaking. "How is [MASK]?" she said, after a moment. "Very well, thanks," I said. "Quite cheerful and happy?" "Oh, yes. Yes, rather."
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Favell	"Take care, [MASK], take care." "You think you can get the better of me, don't you? You think I've got no case to bring to a court of law. I'll get my proof for you all right.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	But a ship with her depth would touch all right." "I was down in the first cove by the valley when they fired the rockets," said [MASK]. "I could scarcely see three yards in front of me where I was.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	"They've got fed up," said the coast-guard. "1 don't blame them," said [MASK]. "I don't suppose anything will happen for hours. The diver will have to make his report before they try and shift her."
<name>Dorian</name>	Dorian	Henry	[MASK] looks much older, of course, and his hair has gone very grey,- but there is a certain stillness about him, an air of tranquillity that was not there before, and I—rather too late in the day—have lost my diffidence, my timidity, my shyness with strangers.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Julyan	"[MASK] won't mind," he said. "No," I said. "We shall have to-morrow night too," he said. "They won't do anything at once, not for twenty-four hours perhaps."
<name>him</name>	him	Rebecca	I had not done it, you see, for a long time. I never went out with [MASK]. "And 1 thought of the tide, how swift it ran and strong into the little cove. The wind blew down from the headland like a funnel.
<name>let's go</name>	let's go	Jasper	"Oh," I said, "I'm sorry you can’t find any." "That's right," he said, "no shell here." "Come on, [MASK]," 1 said, "it's getting late.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Rebecca	What a God-damned appalling thing, eh? Not the sort of thing one would ever connect with [MASK]. Do you fellows feel like a drink? I'm all out over this, and I don't mind admitting it.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Beatrice	"But, my dear, you must," she said in dismay. "You can't possibly not appear." "No, [MASK], I'm not coming down. 1 can’t face them, not after what's happened."
<name>the cat</name>	the cat	Jasper	Of course I've never had anything to do with her, and I don't think I ever want to either. However, she's always been very civil to me." I went on patting [MASK]'s head. "Did she seem friendly?"
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Favell	I knew all the colour was draining away from my face. I leant back against the cushion of the chair. "There's a local half-wit who spends his time on the beach," said [MASK].
<name>Madame</name>	Madame	Maxim	"Yes, [MASK]?" 1 said. "He thinks, you see, it was deliberate on your part. You had some bet that you would startle him, didn't you? Some foolish joke. And of course, he doesn't understand.
<name>I</name>	I	1	I'll dress in the bathroom, and be ready in five minutes." He took his clothes off the chair and threw them on the bathroom floor, and went inside, slamming the door. [MASK] sat down on the bed and began biting my nails.
<name>Me</name>	Me	Rebecca	You see, I know that all the time, whenever I meet anyone new, they are all thinking the same thing—How different she is to [MASK]." I stopped, breathless, already a little ashamed of my outburst, feeling that now at any rate I had burnt my boats for all time.
<name>the girl</name>	the girl	Frank	"She ought to have been the boy," he said. "My lad is different altogether. No earthly use at games. Always writing poetry. I suppose he'll grow out of it." "Oh, rather," said [MASK].
<name>Unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Maxim	I wanted to go with him, but he insisted on going alone. He was not in a fit state to undertake anything of the sort." "That's nonsense," said [MASK]. "I was perfectly well."
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rebecca	I tell you it's some fool fellow who had discovered a new way of bleaching her hair or whitening the skin, and [MASK] had probably got the address from her hair-dresser that morning and went along after lunch out of curiosity."
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Maxim	"I wanted to come," I said. He did not say any more about it. He settled himself in the corner. "It’s fine, that's one thing," he said. "Yes," said [MASK].
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Favell	[MASK] leant forward and filled his case with cigarettes from the box on the table. "1 suppose I'm not going to be asked to stop to dinner?" he said. Nobody answered. He lit one of the cigarettes, and blew a cloud of smoke into the air.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Beatrice	I waited for the clapping and the laughter that would follow as I walked slowly down the stairs. Nobody clapped, nobody moved. They all stared at me like dumb things. [MASK] uttered a little cry and put her hand to her mouth.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Phillips	"You heard what they said," he went on, "they think she was trapped there, in the cabin. The jury will believe that at the inquest too. [MASK] will tell them so." He paused. Still I did not speak.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Beatrice	They did not want to hold it close, imprisoned and secure, as I did. They were not afraid. "Well, I suppose we ought to be off," said [MASK], brushing the grass from her skirt.
<name>the doctor</name>	the doctor	Frith	"Yes," I said. "I shall have to tell him the truth," he said. "It makes it easier for them. They know where they are." "Yes," I said. The door opened and [MASK] came into the room.
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Maxim	"Oh, same as ever, always talking about her health. He's getting very old. They're sure to ask all about you both." "Give them my love," said [MASK]. We got up.
<name>it</name>	it	Maxim	Done [MASK] a power of good too, besides being easier from your point of view. I can't help feeling it's all going to be rather a strain here for you at first." "Oh, I don't think so," I said.
<name>Judas</name>	Judas	Judas	A denial heralded the thrice crowing of a cock, and an insincerity was like the kiss of [MASK]. The adult mind can lie with untroubled conscience and a gay composure, but in those days even a small deception scoured the tongue, lashing one against the stake itself.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Clarice	I did not want the housemaids to know, if [MASK] had not told them. I had a bath and dressed, and went downstairs. The men had taken up the floor already in the hall and the flowers had been carried away. The music stands were gone from the gallery.
<name>Wiggins</name>	Wiggins	Baker	"Here it is, written down," he said, "[MASK], two o'clock. And a big cross beside it, to show that the appointment was kept. And here is the telephone address. Museum 0488.”
<name>Green Gables</name>	Green Gables	Manderley	" 'I'll run your house for you,' she told me, 'I'll look after your precious [MASK] for you, make it the most famous show-place in all the country, if you like.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Frank	"1 don't know what she's doing," he said, "she's been up in her bedroom for hours. What's the time, [MASK]? The dinner crowd will be upon us before we know where we are."
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Rebecca	I've got something to tell you and I want to see you as soon as possible. [MASK]." He put the note back in his pocket. 'That's not the sort of note you write when you're going to commit suicide, is it?"
<name>Rebecca</name>	Rebecca	Menabilly	This time there was no owl, but blackbird, thrush and robin greeting the summer day. I edged my way on to the lawn, and there she stood. My house of secrets. My elusive [MASK] . . . The windows were shuttered fast, white and barred.
<name>Lady Bracknell</name>	Lady Bracknell	Beatrice	he asked [MASK]. "It's five past eight now." "Say she's feeling rather faint, but will try and come down later. Tell them not to wait dinner. I'll be down directly, I'll make it all right."
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maxim	The voice I had heard on the terrace was calm and practical. The voice I knew. Not the voice of last night when I stood at the head of the stairs. [MASK] had not gone away. He was down there in the cove somewhere.
<name>Toad</name>	Toad	Jasper	[MASK] was sniffing at the iron ladder. "Come away," 1 said. "I don't want to go in after you." I went back along the harbour wall to the beach. The cottage did not seem so remote and sinister at the edge of the wood as it had done before.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Frank	In that particular place too, just by the ridge." "It was very squally that night," said [MASK], "something may have happened to the gear. Something may have jammed. And then she slipped down for a knife." "Of course.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Maxim	It was pleasant and comfortable sitting there and nothing mattered very much. I smiled at the waiter. I asked for some more bread in French for no reason. It was quiet and happy and friendly in the restaurant. [MASK] and I were together. Everything was over.
<name>Uncle Julian</name>	Uncle Julian	Beatrice	"Are you in a frightful hurry to get home?" said [MASK]. "No," I said. "I don't think so. Why?" "Would you think me a perfect pig if I dropped you at the lodge gates?
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Maxim	She stood there, looking at me, that slow smile on her face, her eyes wide open . . ." [MASK]'s voice had sunk low, so low, that it was like a whisper. The hand that I held between my own was cold.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Maxim	[MASK] laughed again. "What a disappointment to you. What did you hope I was thinking?" "Something very different." "What sort of thing?" "Oh, I don't know." "No, I don't suppose you do.
<name>John</name>	John	Frith	"Oh, no," I said, "I would not dream of it. I will go into the morning-room. Thank you, [MASK]." "You will find writing-paper, and pens, and ink, in there, Madam," he said.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Frith	"Certainly, Madam." I went on holding my knees and sitting very still. He came back with a liqueur glass on a silver salver. "Do you feel a trifle unwell, Madam?" said [MASK].
<name>him</name>	him	Maxim	When I go returning these calls, as I did this afternoon, I know people are looking me up and down, wondering what sort of success I'm going to make of it. I can imagine them saying, 'What on earth does [MASK] see in her?'
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Max	"'You're right, [MASK],' she said. 'It's time I turned over a new leaf.' "She looked very pale, very thin. She began walking up and down the room, her hands in the pockets of her trousers.
<name>Conway</name>	Conway	Frank	I did not expect her. I dined that night with [MASK] at his house, we had a lot of work on at the time." He was speaking now in short, jerky sentences. I had his hands very tightly between my two hands.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Jasper	I knew now why [MASK] had turned to it. It led to the beach he knew best, and the cottage. It was his old routine. We came out on the lawns, and went across them to the house without a word.
<name>Jordan</name>	Jordan	Bee	"I never asked them alone again. They came officially, to garden-parties, and dances. [MASK] never said a word to me or 1 to her. But I think she guessed my life, I think she knew.
<name>him</name>	him	Maxim	Five minutes must have passed before we were alone again, and when 1 looked at [MASK] I saw the colour had come back into his face, the tired, lost look was gone, and he was reaching for a sandwich.
<name>Mrs. Barrymore</name>	Mrs. Barrymore	Giles	I shall get into a fine row.” "Don't say anything about it," I said. "I would much rather it was forgotten. The story will only get repeated and exaggerated." "[MASK] will know something is wrong from my face.
<name>Tracker</name>	Tracker	Jasper	We trod upon broken twigs, and last year's leaves, and here and there the fresh green stubble of the young bracken, and the shoots of the bluebells soon to blossom. [MASK] was silent now, his nose to the ground.
<name>Narrator</name>	Narrator	Maxim	"How could he?" said [MASK]. "There was nobody there but myself. It was dark . . He stopped. He sat down on a chair, he put his hand up to his forehead. 1 went and knelt beside him.
<name>Toby</name>	Toby	Jasper	"No, Madam, 1 could not say." I wandered back again into the hall. I went through the drawing-room to the morning-room. [MASK] rushed at me and licked my hands in a frenzy of delight as if I had been away for a long time.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Favell	He caught sight of me, and 1 gave him a weak, rather tremulous smile. I don't know if he recognised me or not. He just blinked his eyes. Then [MASK] walked slowly towards him and stood in front of him.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Favell	Even the poor idiot we have just had in this room swears he never saw you. You can't even prove your own story, can you?" "Can't 1?" said [MASK]. I saw him smile. He came across to the fireplace and rang the bell.
<name>Macbeth</name>	Macbeth	Rebecca	You've asked for my opinion, and by God you shall have it. [MASK] was murdered. And if you want to know who the murderer is, why there he stands, by the window there, with that God-damned superior smile on his face.
<name>Old Drum</name>	Old Drum	Jasper	[MASK] sat close to the table, his tail thumping now and again upon the floor, his eyes fixed expectantly on me. It's funny, I thought, how the routine of life goes on, whatever happens,-we do the same things, go through the little performance of eating, sleeping, washing.
<name>Rainsford</name>	Rainsford	Frank	"They'll argue a bit first no doubt, like all foreigners. Here come the tugs." "They'll never do it," said [MASK]. "Look at the angle she's lying at. It's much shallower there than I thought."
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Molly	"Yes,” I said. "I've enjoyed every minute of it," he said. "I'm so glad," I said. "[MASK] was wild with fury at missing it," he said. "Was she?" I said.
<name>Miss Ivors</name>	Miss Ivors	Beatrice	The door opened and [MASK] came into the room. She came to me at once, a strange rather ludicrous figure in her eastern drapery, the bangles jangling on her wrists. "My dear," she said, "my dear," and held out her hands to me.
<name>Aunt Alexandra</name>	Aunt Alexandra	Frank	"Oh, but that would not look right at all," said [MASK] seriously. "People would be very offended. You must dance with the people who ask you." I turned away to hide my smile.
<name>Aunt Augusta</name>	Aunt Augusta	Maxim	You wouldn't know what to do with yourself. [MASK] says you paint. That's very nice, of course, but there's no exercise in it, is there? All very well on a wet day when there's nothing better to do." ''
<name>the witness</name>	the witness	Maxim	There is a seat there, just inside the door. If you slip in now nobody will notice you." "Yes," I said. "Yes, I think I will." It was nearly over. [MASK] had finished giving his evidence.
<name>Dr. Watson</name>	Dr. Watson	Frank	I sat quite still, the floor, the walls, the figures of [MASK] and the policeman taking solid shape before me. "I'm so sorry," I said, "such a stupid thing to do. It was so hot in that room, so very hot."
<name>Diana</name>	Diana	Beatrice	1 wished 1 could see her young, as she was once, with colour in her cheeks and chestnut hair, alert and active as [MASK] by her side, talking as she did about hunting, hounds, and horses.
<name>him</name>	him	Maxim	I did not want it myself, 1 was not hungry. I felt very weak now, very tired in a dull, spent way. 1 looked at [MASK] but he was reading his paper, he had folded it over to another page.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Maxim	He laughed, and looked at [MASK]. His face was still very flushed. Excitement had made him sweat; there were beads of perspiration on his forehead. I noticed how his neck bulged over the back of his collar, and how low his ears were set on his head.
<name>dog</name>	dog	Jasper	It would be awkward if I met them face to face on the stairs or somewhere. I remembered I had left my knitting in the morning-room before lunch, and 1 went along through the drawing-room to fetch it, the faithful [MASK] at my heels.
<name>Amy</name>	Amy	Clarice	They are supposed to stand out from the face.” [MASK] stood behind my shoulder, I saw her round face beyond mine in the reflection of the looking-glass, her eyes shining, her mouth a little open. I brushed my own hair sleek behind my ears.
<name>Mrs. Mulligan</name>	Mrs. Mulligan	Charlie	"When's the diver coming up again?" he said. "Not yet, sonny," said the coast-guard. A woman in a pink striped frock and a hair-net came across the grass towards us. "[MASK]?
<name>Nick</name>	Nick	Frank	He went on looking out of the window. Then "Yes," he said, his voice without expression. "Yes, we must go on being together." [MASK] came back into the room. He stood in the entrance, his hand on the door.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Robert	Whatever happened 1 must not be afraid. I cut my roses and took them back into the morning-room. The carpet had been dusted, and the fallen petals removed. 1 began to arrange the flowers in the vases that [MASK] had filled with water.
<name>Maxwell</name>	Maxwell	Maxim	1 found an envelope to put them in. I hid the envelope at the back of one of the drawers in the desk. Then I took the books off to the library and found room for them on the shelves. [MASK] laughed when I showed them to him with pride.
<name>who</name>	who	Maxim	They circled round and round the stranded steamer chatting excitedly. I could hear their voices echoing across the still water. I left the breakwater and the cove and climbed up the path over the cliffs towards the rest of the people. I did not see [MASK] anywhere.
<name>Sir Henry Baskerville</name>	Sir Henry Baskerville	Maxim	As we drove up to the wide stone steps and stopped before the open door, 1 saw through one of the mullioned windows that the hall was full of people, and 1 heard [MASK] swear under his breath. "
<name>he</name>	he	Maxim	"They have air pumped into them all the time. Watch him disappear. There he goes." The surface of the water was disturbed a minute and then was clear again. "He's gone," said the small boy. "Where's [MASK]?"
<name>my book</name>	my book	Jasper	1 wonder why they come to me about it. That's your job, sweetheart." I looked up from [MASK], my face red as fire. "Darling," 1 said, "I meant to tell you before, but—but I forgot.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Maxim	[MASK] came back into the library. "It's begun," he said slowly. "What do you mean, what's happened?" I said, grown suddenly cold. "It was a reporter," he said, "the fellow from the County Chronicle.
<name>she</name>	she	Frank	The person at the tiller would wipe the spray out of her eyes and hair, glance up at the straining mast. I wondered what colour the boat had been. Green and white perhaps, like the buoy. Not very big, [MASK] had said, with a little cabin.
<name>Amyas</name>	Amyas	Maxim	A yellow butterfly winged his foolish way before me to the terrace. I went into the hall and through to the dining-room. My place was still laid, but [MASK]'s had been cleared away. The cold meat and salad awaited me on the sideboard.
<name>Miss Kilbride</name>	Miss Kilbride	Blaize	The vision of the consumptive son faded, and in its stead arose the picture of myself had 1 been different, pocketing that greasy note with an understanding smile, and perhaps slipping round to [MASK]'s shop on this my free afternoon and coming away with a frock I had not paid for.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Beatrice	We drove down the smooth gravel drive and out of the white gates. I stared straight in front of me down the road. I did not mind for myself. I should not have cared if I had been alone. I minded for [MASK].
<name>Mr. Micawber</name>	Mr. Micawber	Favell	He doesn't know what he's saying." "Drunk, am I?" shouted [MASK]. "Oh, no, my fine friend. You may be a magistrate and a colonel into the bargain, but it won't cut any ice with me.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Max	I saw your wife faint, at a rather critical moment, and I don't blame her. It was touch and go, then, wasn't it, [MASK], what way the enquiry would go? And luckily for you it went the way it did.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Giles	"No," I said. "No, I don't want anything." "I shall have to go down. [MASK] says they are waiting dinner. Are you sure it's all right for me to leave you?" "Yes.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Frank	We did not say anything about the ball for a little while, and then, when I had finished my cup of tea and wiped my sticky fingers on a handkerchief, 1 said to [MASK], "What do you truthfully think about this fancy dress business?"
<name>he</name>	he	Maxim	they would say and my answer would come, "1 don't know, [MASK] has not said much about it up to the present." "No, of course not, it's early yet. I believe the house was generally full of people in the old days."
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Jasper	I got up from the bluebells and called sharply to [MASK]. We set off together down the valley to the beach. The tide was out, the sea very calm and remote. It looked like a great placid lake out there in the bay.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Maxim	[MASK] was standing up over there. The heat was coming up at me from the floor, rising in slow waves. It reached my hands, wet and slippery, it touched my neck, my chin, my face.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Rebecca	"Really? Oh, well, perhaps he would. . . "Why?" I said. "I rather think he was [MASK]'s cousin," she said. I was very surprised. That man her relation?
<name>the narrator</name>	the narrator	Frank	"Yes." "They can't prove anything against you," I said. "Nobody saw you that night. You had gone to bed. They can't prove anything. No one knows but you and I. No one at all. Not even [MASK].
<name>Stimson</name>	Stimson	Robert	We were evidently still living on the remains. This must be the cold lunch that was put out in the dining-room yesterday and 1 had not eaten. The staff were taking things easily it seemed. I put a pencil through the list and rang for [MASK]. "
<name>the diver</name>	the diver	Frank	It doesn't matter. I want to see what the diver's going to do." Somehow I could not not face [MASK] just at the moment. I wanted to be alone, or with someone I did not know, like the coast-guard.
<name>he</name>	he	Roger	No,1' I said awkwardly. "No, I don't think so." "No morning sickness or anything like that?" "No." "Oh, well—of course it doesn't always follow. I never turned a hair when [MASK] was born.
<name>my hat</name>	my hat	Jasper	"Good afternoon," I said, tugging at [MASK]. The man nodded, staring at me with his narrow idiot's eyes. "1 saw 'ee go in yonder," he said. "Yes," I said, "it's all right.
<name>Madame Bovary</name>	Madame Bovary	Max	"Suddenly she slipped off the table and stood in front of me, smiling still, her hands in her pockets. " 'If 1 had a child, [MASK],' she said, 'neither you, nor anyone in the world, would ever prove that it was not yours.
<name>him</name>	him	Maxim	She never took her eyes away from [MASK]. It's too late, I thought, she can't do anything to us now, the harm is done. It does not matter what she says to us now, or what she does. The harm is done.
