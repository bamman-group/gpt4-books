<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Bernie	If [MASK] were alive they would be discussing the case, cosily ensconced in the furthest corner of some Cambridge pub, insulated by noise and smoke and anonymity from the curiosity of their neighbours; talking low voiced in their own particular jargon.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Nanny	I wouldn’t have believed it, but when I went to her she just put out her hand and said: ‘I’m sorry, [MASK], I think it would be better if you went.’ “Pregnant women have strange fancies, I know, and the baby was so important to them both.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Bernie	I had taught myself some shorthand and typing so I took a job with a secretarial agency. They sent me to [MASK] and after a few weeks he let me help him with one or two of the cases. He’d decided to train me and I agreed to stay on permanently.
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Cordelia	[MASK] opened it. She hardly knew what she expected to find; an inscription perhaps, or a message, cryptic or plain, a letter folded between the leaves. But the only inscription could have no possible relevance to the case.
<name>Stella</name>	Stella	Cordelia	Where is the buckle?” “At the back of the neck under the left ear. There’s a photograph of the indentation it made in the flesh later in the file.” [MASK] did not look. Why, she wondered, had he shown her the photograph?
<name>Ann</name>	Ann	Cordelia	This note is confirmation of identity.” [MASK] was swept with relief so immense that she felt physically sick. She clenched her fist and felt the sweat start on her brow. She began to shiver with cold. It never occurred to her that he might be lying.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Cordelia	The poster had always fascinated [MASK]. A curvaceous blonde, clad in brief hot pants and laughing hysterically, was leap frogging over her typewriter, a feat she managed to perform with a maximum of exposure while clutching a fistful of five pound notes in each hand.
<name>Rebus</name>	Rebus	Cordelia	One of the police panda cars drove off first and the Mini followed. The police driver drove fast, lurching the little car around the corners. [MASK]’s head lolled against the back of the seat and, from time to time, was thrown against the driver’s arm.
<name>Inspector</name>	Inspector	Eliza	Have we a photograph, [MASK]?” “There is his passport somewhere but I’m not sure where. I have that photograph I took of him in the garden last summer. It shows him fairly clearly, I think. I’ll get it.”
<name>He</name>	He	Cordelia	If he had come to this solitary life to study, to write or to philosophize he had come singularly ill-equipped. The most interesting thing in the room was above the bed. It was a small oil painting about nine inches square. [MASK] studied it.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cordelia	There were three doors; one straight ahead obviously led to the front garden but was locked and barred, the joints hung with cobwebs as if it hadn’t been opened for generations. One to the right led, as [MASK] guessed, to the kitchen.
<name>He</name>	He	Cordelia	It was a College Feast night. I sat next to him. His son telephoned him.” [MASK] said eagerly, almost tugging at his sleeve: “At what time?” “Soon after the meal started, I suppose.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Mark	[MASK]’s murderer had been there first. She asked suddenly: “Someone played a stupid trick on me last night. When I got back here from the party there was a bolster slung from that hook. Did you do that?”
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Mark	She washed in the kitchen as [MASK] had obviously done, standing in the tin bath from the shed and gasping as she poured saucepans of cold tap water over her naked body. There was something about the simple life which disposed one to these austerities.
<name>She</name>	She	Cordelia	Then the visitor said: “Well, I seem to have had a wasted journey.” [MASK] breathed an almost inaudible “Oh no!” and resisted an absurd impulse to fling her body against the door. “Please don’t go before talking to me.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Hugo	He was carrying three bottles of wine. He had obviously heard at least part of the conversation, as the girls had no doubt intended, but he grinned amiably. “Funny how [MASK]’s discarded women always hate him so much.
<name>Delia</name>	Delia	Cordelia	And now when she knew that, unaided, she could get no further, [MASK] saw salvation. A few feet above her was the bottom rung of a short wooden ladder fixed to the last few feet of the well.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	She took a cup herself and returned to her usual chair. And now there was the sound of yet another car. A middle-aged woman came in with a uniformed chauffeur at her shoulder. Through the fog of her tiredness, [MASK] heard a high, didactic voice.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Mark	I didn’t want him to be suspicious.” “But didn’t it occur to you when you found [MASK] that there might be something odd about the death? The door was unlocked although the curtains were drawn. The lipstick was missing.”
<name>Tranter's</name>	Tranter's	Tilling	But that, of course, was part of the plan, that was [MASK] strategy. If you can’t shame her into giving up the case, suborn her; take her on the river; be nice to her; get her on our side.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mark	It was terrible but it was funny too. I wanted to laugh and scream at the same time. He didn’t look like [MASK]. He didn’t look like a human being at all. And on the table there were three pictures.
<name>Tuppence</name>	Tuppence	Cordelia	They didn’t speak about the case during the drive. [MASK] was exhausted with tiredness, food and wine and allowed herself to be firmly taken in hand and placed in the train without attempting to gain any further information. She didn’t really think she would have got it.
<name>Chauvelin</name>	Chauvelin	Mark	He’s not in a mood to stand any nonsense from Englishmen at present.” “And what about you? If anyone asks you how [MASK] died, you’ll never tell them the truth?” “What do you think?
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Cordelia	“Perhaps not. At least the violence he practiced was on himself” She looked up at [MASK] searchingly. “No doubt you’ll say I’m jealous of youth. It’s a common enough syndrome of my generation.” “It ought not to be.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Cordelia	Her face was pale and long. She was reading The Times, the paper folded so that she could hold it in her right hand. After a couple of seconds, she became aware of [MASK] and their eyes met. The woman looked at her wrist watch.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Cordelia	She was smiling saucily over her shoulder in a blatant invitation made more grotesque by the long androgynous face which even tactful lighting couldn’t make other than repellent. [MASK] noted the date at the top of the page; it was the May edition.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cordelia	Their eyes met. In that moment [MASK] knew how close she had come to giving up the case. She had been suborned by the beauty of the day, by sunshine, indolence, the promise of comradeship, even friendship, into forgetting why she was here.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Lunn	Nothing of [MASK] except his bones has survived that crash.” “There are still the female clothes, the black pants and the bra. Someone might remember who bought them, particularly if that person was a man.” “Men do buy underclothes for their women.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cordelia	I went out of curiosity and respect; you mustn’t be seduced by my air of casual flippancy into thinking that I haven’t a heart.” [MASK] said obstinately: “Someone visited him at the cottage on the evening he died. Someone had coffee with him.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Blake	And yet there was the analogy of falling, of launching oneself into the void. But this speculation was indulgent fantasy. He had chosen [MASK]: he had chosen hanging. Perhaps other and more gentle means were not to hand; perhaps he had _acted upon impulse.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	There was such controlled intensity in her regard that [MASK] waited almost with apprehension for her to speak. But she turned away, her shoulders drooping as if with sudden fatigue, and all she said was: “I’ve found the photograph.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Mark	He couldn’t bear anyone to be near her. We only had a few minutes together just before she died and it was then that she asked me to give her prayer book to [MASK] on his twenty-first birthday.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cordelia	The house smelt horrible, an amalgam of extreme old age, the sour taint of excreta and stale food, with an overlay of strong disinfectant. [MASK] went through to the garden, carefully avoiding looking at the hall or kitchen since curiosity might seem impertinent.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	“Yes, sir.” The reply was deferential. They stood aside to let the expert through. He turned to [MASK], perhaps because she was nearest. “If you didn’t witness the accident, young woman, you’d better get on your way.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	He was a man who sweated profusely; the underarms of his shirt were stained and the cotton stuck to the flesh emphasizing the strong curve of the back and the obtrusive biceps. [MASK] saw that the three of them were to sit squashed together in the front of the van.
<name>She</name>	She	Cordelia	He turned over a new page of the file and suddenly thrust it towards her. The photograph, uncompromising, unambiguous, a brutal surrealism in black and white, would have looked as artificial as a sick joke if the body were not so obviously dead. [MASK] felt her heart hammering against her chest.
<name>Septimus</name>	Septimus	Cordelia	At rest; the commonest epitaph of a generation to whom rest must have seemed the ultimate luxury, the supreme benediction. The woman rested back for a second on her heels and contemplated the grave with satisfaction. It was then that she became aware of [MASK].
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cordelia	He stayed in his seat while the two women got out then drove the van round the side of the house. As she slid down from the high seat [MASK] could glimpse a range of low buildings, topped with small ornamental turrets, which she took to be stables or garages.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Cordelia	[MASK] gazed at it in excited pleasure. Surely she couldn’t mistake that individual blue of the girl’s dress, that marvellous painting of the cheeks and plump young arms, skin which simultaneously absorbed and reflected light-—lovely, tangible flesh.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	Perhaps as the evening wore on they would get careless and there would be a chance to separate them. In the meantime, [MASK] decided to explore the house, and a more practical matter, to find out before she needed it where the lavatory was.
<name>him</name>	him	Mark	I thought that I might see him in the garden, but he was not there, only the garden fork in the ground and his shoes at the door. So I pushed open the door. I did not knock because I thought I would be a surprise for [MASK].”
<name>Virginia</name>	Virginia	Cordelia	[MASK] began to read to herself the first half-remembered words: a void, boundless as the nether shy appeared beneath us... She was struck, not for the first time, by the importance of the written word, the magic of ordered symbols.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Miss.	Then he folded it away. “I’ll have to keep this note for the present, [MASK] What did he get up to here?” “He didn’t get up to anything. This was his office. He was a private detective.”
<name>Grigory</name>	Grigory	Mark	“Of course I don’t suspect him of killing his son. He doesn’t know how [MASK] died and he desperately needs to know. That’s why he’s taken me on. I could tell that at our interview; I couldn’t be wrong about that.
<name>Fenchurch</name>	Fenchurch	Cordelia	[MASK]’s hands tightened momentarily on the wheel and the Mini jerked to a stop. She ran forward round the corner and saw before her the gleaming, headlamp lit surface of the main Cambridge road. It was peopled with running shapes.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Cordelia	[MASK] was relieved to see that there was space to park the Mini. There was no sign of the Renault among the almost continuous row of old cars and battered bicycles which lined the edge of the pavement. The front door was wide open.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Cordelia	You can put them out on a tray. The milk is in the fridge.” [MASK] moved like an automaton. The milk bottle was an icy column in her hands, the biscuit tin lid resisted her tired fingers and she broke a nail prising it off.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Evelyn	He even subsidized his own deceit. The cheques for [MASK] began to arrive, each with a note imploring her to look after her health, to consult the best London doctors, to rest, to take a holiday in the sun.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	That’s the kind of detail the police are trained to notice.” Alone again, [MASK] took up the gun. It was astonishing how repulsive she found this inert weight of metal now. How odd that she should ever have seen it as a harmless toy?
<name>Arabella</name>	Arabella	Sophie	He rested his hands on the punt and opened his mouth to be fed chunks of sandwiches by a protesting [MASK]. The punts and canoes scraped and jostled each other in the turbulence of white water racing under the bridge.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Isabelle	I doubt whether he could enjoy sex until he’d convinced himself that he and the girl were in love. It was a necessary preliminary—like undressing. I gather that with [MASK] the relationship hadn’t reached the necessary depths, hadn’t achieved the essential emotional rapport.
<name>She</name>	She	Isabelle	The violet eyes slewed from door to window as if desperate for escape. “I wasn’t there when he did it.” “When who did what?” [MASK] retreated towards the bed as if the inert figure, who was now groaning stertorously, could offer support.
<name>Orlando</name>	Orlando	Cordelia	“No, but I do not think he got what he wanted. Afterwards he was sad for a little time, but then we went to the sea and he was happy again.” She, too, seemed happy now. She smiled at [MASK], her sweet, unmeaning smile.
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cordelia	Despite the heat, she was wearing Wellington boots, a jumper and long tweed skirt and had a scarf tied round her head. When she saw [MASK] she dropped the handle of the wheelbarrow and said: “Oh, good morning.
<name>Emma</name>	Emma	Cordelia	[MASK] knew that she was driving erratically. Passing cars hooted at her and flashed their lights and one motorist slowed down and shouted angrily. She saw a gate and drew in off the road and switched off the engine. The silence was absolute. Her hands were moist and shaking.
<name>He</name>	He	Cordelia	I didn’t see her again.” Before [MASK] could speak she said suddenly: “You’re thinking of living here for a time, aren’t you?” “Will they mind? I didn’t like to ask in case they said no.”
<name>Lisbeth</name>	Lisbeth	Cordelia	[MASK] tried to control her breathing. It seemed impossible that he should not hear, smell or see her, that he should be so like a predator yet without the beast’s instinct for the enemy in the dark. He moved forward. Now he was at the well.
<name>they</name>	they	Bernie	And we don’t touch industrial sabotage.” The temptation to either wasn’t great. They had no bugging equipment and wouldn’t have known how to use it if they had, and at no time had [MASK] been invited to touch industrial sabotage.
<name>He</name>	He	Cordelia	A train had just passed and the barriers were being raised. Three vehicles had been caught at the crossing and the last in line was quickest away, accelerating past the first two cars as they bumped slowly over the rails. [MASK] saw that it was a small black van.
<name>Morstan</name>	Morstan	Lunn	He never did suspect, did he? You chose him as your wife’s doctor because he was old and incompetent. But I did have one small piece of evidence. [MASK] was bringing it to you.” “Then you should have looked after it better.
<name>Milly</name>	Milly	Isabelle	[MASK] goes to the theatre to be seen rather than to see and is bored by any show with a cast of less than fifty, so she was the one left out. Thus neglected by her current lover, she very reasonably decided to seek consolation with the next.”
<name>Angela</name>	Angela	Bernie	It had only taken one night of long and deep sleep to return her to the state which [MASK], with irritating coyness, used to describe as bright eyed and bushy tailed. Even without the benison of a hot bath the broken skin on her shoulders and back had healed cleanly.
<name>Hastings</name>	Hastings	Cordelia	It pointed directly to you. That was the strongest evidence I had.” They had reached the car now and paused together. [MASK] said: “We mustn’t waste any more time before ringing the police. Someone may have heard the shot.”
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Mark	The picture probably had nothing to do with [MASK]; it could easily have been dropped by some visitor to the cottage. But she wished that she hadn’t seen it. She passed round to the west of the cottage and made one more discovery.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Mark	Surely [MASK] would have shared it with his guest or, if he preferred not to drink coffee, would have opened a tin of beer for himself But there was no empty beer can in the kitchen and no second ,—mug. Had it perhaps been washed and put away?
<name>Gerda</name>	Gerda	Mark	And don’t say that what I’m doing here isn’t worth one single human life. Spare me that hypocrisy. You don’t know and you’re incapable of under- standing the value of what I’m doing here. What difference will [MASK]’s death make to you?
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mark	I suppose it gave her some kind of a kick.” Her companion laughed. “And little brother takes over [MASK]’s girl. If you can’t get beauty, money and brains, settle for the first two.
<name>Reacher</name>	Reacher	Cordelia	The question might have sounded offensive but it wasn’t; he was completely matter-of-fact. [MASK] told him, a little too quickly, a little too eagerly. “Five pounds a day and expenses, but we try to keep those as low as possible.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Isabelle	Fifty yards farther on she came to it, a row of six small stucco houses standing back from a lay-by. She stopped the car outside number four remembering [MASK], biddable and docile, who had obviously been told to drive further on and wait in the car.
<name>Massey</name>	Massey	Bernie	She remembered a piece of Dalgliesh dogma, reported by [MASK], which had seemed to her at the time more appropriate advice for a criminal than a detective) “Never tell an unnecessary lie; the truth has great authority.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Cordelia	If more employers were prepared to do that, the country wouldn’t be plagued with this inflation.” He spoke as one to whom economics were an open book. “Didn’t you think it was odd, his turning up like that?” asked [MASK].
<name>Poirot</name>	Poirot	Cordelia	She held out her hands in a gesture which could have been resignation or despair: “We knew nothing about him, nothing! So why wait until he’s dead and then start finding out?” “And his friends?” asked [MASK] quietly.
<name>Clarissa</name>	Clarissa	Cordelia	[MASK] rubbed her fingers with desperate haste against the gritty accretion of years. But, at last, she felt the cold smooth glass. It squeaked with the friction of her fingers, high and thin like an animal’s squeal so that she thought the noise must betray her.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	They came together quietly up the path and conferred briefly at the front door, then moved towards the corner of the cottage. Snatching up her torch, [MASK] rushed on silent, naked feet down the stairs and threw herself across the sitting-room to unlock the back door.
<name>Camilla</name>	Camilla	Cordelia	The pungent smell of burning was wafted away on the breeze. As soon as the flame tinged her fingers, [MASK] dropped the envelope, still burning, and watched it twist and turn as it floated down small and frail as a snowflake to be lost at last in the Cam.
<name>She</name>	She	Cordelia	[MASK] could not look at his eyes, but she was conscious of feeling nothing, not hatred, or anger, or pity. Between her eyes and the sprawled figure swung an elongated shape, head hideously crooked, toes pathetically pointed.
<name>Quentin</name>	Quentin	Bernie	She unlocked the small drawer at the base of [MASK]’s desk to which only she and he had a key and drew it out. It was still in the suede draw-string bag which she had made for it, with three rounds of ammunition packed separately.
<name>He</name>	He	Cordelia	From time to time, she dropped into the punnet her little mush of weeds. After a couple of minutes, during which [MASK] watched her in silence, she paused satisfied and began smoothing the surface of the grass as if comforting the bones beneath.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ronald	If she refused, then [MASK] would leave her and seek a divorce to marry me.” “I would rather have left him and gone off to scrub doorsteps.” “Not everyone has a talent for scrubbing doorsteps and not everyone has your capacity for moral indignation.
<name>Watson</name>	Watson	Ronald	As you pointed out to [MASK], it falls under your fair deal clause. Strictly speaking you aren’t entitled to any. All the same, I think it would look less suspicious if you took your expenses. Would thirty pounds strike you as reasonable?”
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Cordelia	They would be that much more meticulous, that much more tactful. But it was still only a case. [MASK] sat alone and waited. She was suddenly overcome with tiredness. She longed for nothing but to put down her head on the hall table and sleep.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mark	Shocked and restless, she wandered aimlessly from room to room and prowled around the garden, fretting to be away. Finally in desperation she took hold of the garden fork and completed the digging of [MASK]’s unfinished row.
<name>She</name>	She	Cordelia	On each side a holly tree stood sentinel, its leaves grey with dust. The front hedge of privet was head-high. [MASK] could see that on either side of the path there had once been twin flower beds edged with large round stones which had been painted white.
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Dalgliesh	The two men disliked each other but only one of them knew this and he was the one to whom it didn’t matter. [MASK] made his report, concisely, logically, without referring to his notes. This was his invariable habit.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Hugo	Would he be there tonight?” [MASK] put down the bottle he was holding. “He may be. He’s one of the few who live in college. But I doubt whether you would winkle him out of his lair on your own.
<name>David</name>	David	Cordelia	The incandescent flame was invisible in the stronger light of the sun. All [MASK] could see was a narrow band of wavering purple light as the flame bit into the paper and the charred edges widened and grew. The pungent smell of burning was wafted away on the breeze.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Mark	“Your son?” “Of course [MASK] was my son. His son and mine. I thought you might have guessed.” She stood with the gun in her hand gazing with expressionless eyes through the open window to the lawn. There was no sound.
<name>Stephen</name>	Stephen	Cordelia	It turned easily as if the lock had been recently oiled. [MASK] followed her into the sitting-room of the cottage. The air was cool after the heat of the garden but unfresh, with a taint of contagion.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Mark	She stumped upstairs and came down with one of [MASK]’s jumpers which she wound round the girl’s neck. Her terror had left her, but she was as agitated as a young girl sharing her first half-shameful adventure. Her eyes were wild, her whole body trembled with excitement.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Cordelia	“You shouldn’t be sarcastic, [MASK], it doesn’t suit you. Sarcasm is all right for some women, but not for women who are beautiful in the way that you are beautiful.” They were passing down the stairs together to meet the hubbub in the hall.
<name>Connie</name>	Connie	Cordelia	When this seemed a danger and the talk became too beguiling, she would murmur her excuses and slip away to the bathroom or into the shadows of the garden where little groups were sitting on the grass smoking pot. [MASK] couldn’t be mistaken in that evocative smell.
<name>Alastor</name>	Alastor	Bernie	He had kicked [MASK] out of the only job he had ever wanted to do; hadn’t troubled to find out what happened to him later; and most irrational indictment of all, he hadn’t even bothered to come to the funeral.
<name>Lucasta</name>	Lucasta	Isabelle	What was aimed at was originality; it was preferable to look spectacular, even bizarre, than to appear nondescript. The sitting-room was elegantly but unsubstantially furnished and [MASK] had impressed on it her own untidy, impractical and iconoclastic femininity.
<name>MacCruiskeen</name>	MacCruiskeen	Bernie	“He must be. The door’s locked and his hat is here.” [MASK]’s trilby, the stained brim turned up all round, a comedian’s hat, was hanging on the convoluted hat-stand, a symbol of forlorn decrepitude.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mark	The door was open, the curtains drawn across. [MASK] was naked except for his blue jeans. There were no magazine pictures on the table and no lipstick on his face. But there was a suicide note in the typewriter and a mound of ash in the grate.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Lunn	“Don’t look at me like that! I only loved one man in my life and he’s the one I’ve just killed. Talk about things you understand. Love had nothing to do with what [MASK] and I needed from each other.”
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Callender	Finally, she found herself a fresh notebook, headed it Case ofMar\ [MASK] and ruled up the last few pages ready for her expense account. These preliminaries had always been the most satisfying part of a case, before boredom or distaste set in, before anticipation crumbled into disenchantment and failure.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Sophie	It was hard luck on [MASK] to waste her hot water, she thought guiltily; but worse was the sense of treachery and shabby opportunism as she crept down the first three stairs and listened. The front door had been closed but the door to the back parlour was open.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Cordelia	All of them, except the blonde girl, were wearing old jeans and open-necked cotton shirts. [MASK] had come up to the group and had stood over them for a few seconds before they took any notice of her.
<name>Werther</name>	Werther	Mark	They’re the only ones who are safe from ultimate disillusionment.” “You’ve thought it all out, haven’t you. I’m not sure that suicides do. The act is probably both impulsive and irrational.” “Was [MASK] impulsive and irrational?”
