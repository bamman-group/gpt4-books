<name>Tea Cake</name>	Tea Cake	Mat	[MASK] said, “All that for what?” The boy looked like he was ready to run some more. Sweat just pouring down the side of his face. He was one of them great big old sissy-looking boys—round, smooth, sissy-looking face.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mapes	No more. They took it. Can’t go there no more.” She stopped. Never raised her head. Still gazing out there in the yard. “I can’t do what I used to do on that river myself,” [MASK] told her.
<name>The detective</name>	The detective	Mapes	“I think I do,” [MASK] said. “I’m sure I do.” “Then why don’t you arrest him?” “They all say the same thing. They all claim they did it.” “But you know who did it?”
<name>McMurphy</name>	McMurphy	Mapes	“Facts. ’Cause this is the day of reckonding, and I will speak the truth, without fear, if it mean I have to spend the rest of my life in jail.” [MASK] grunted—a grunt that said you might.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Mapes	He was about five eight, and weighed round a hundred and forty pounds. Even from this distance you could see he was scared. He was unarmed, and he reached back into the car for a gun. [MASK] spoke to him from over his shoulder, and he put the gun back.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Bea	“I don’t like him,” [MASK] said. “I’ve never liked him. Why we ever let that kind on this land, I don’t know. The land has not been the same since they brought those tractors here.”
<name>him</name>	him	Jack	“I don’t think we’ve progressed that much yet,” he said, looking at the door, not at the customer. I wondered if he heard ghosts singing in there. “I was hoping we had progressed some,” the quiet customer said quietly. He looked at [MASK] a long time.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mathu	I turned from her and looked at [MASK] squatting there, black as pitch, with that double-barrel shotgun cradled in his arms. How many times had I stood in that yard talking to him while he squatted there, and she sitting across from him at the end of the porch?
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Pussy	Get up and drink. Take a little nap, wake up and drink some more. Take another little nap, wake up and come here. Like clockwork. Don’t give a damn for nothing. Women or nothing. [MASK] or nothing. Politics or nothing.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Jameson	He didn’t answer. [MASK] came round the end of the garry where I was sit- ting. He was crying now. He was pressing his lips tight, but I could see the tears running down his face.
<name>George</name>	George	Mat	We sat there awhile looking out at the lines. The water was so clean and blue, peaceful and calm. I coulda sat there all day long looking out there at my line. “Think he did it?” [MASK] asked. I hunched my shoulders.
<name>Curly</name>	Curly	Clatoo	The ones at the tractor turned and fired that way. [MASK] looked at me and nodded. We both got on our knees, hooted, fired, and fell back down. We got one of them, ’cause I could hear his scream.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Yank	But that was good enough for [MASK]. “I broke all the horses, all the mules,” he said. He wasn’t talking to us now. He was thinking back, back when he was a younger man, when he used to do all this.
<name>Margo</name>	Margo	Bea	The drink was made of gin and pink lemonade, garnished with a slice of orange, a cherry, a piece of lime, a sprig of mint, and a paper straw the color of a peppermint stick. I set my drink on the banister, but [MASK] couldn’t wait to get started on hers.
<name>Boone</name>	Boone	Gil	The grass from his footsteps had not sprung back up before I was pressing it back down. And I intended to keep it that way until we got out of there. “[MASK].” The sheriff spoke first.
<name>The narrator</name>	The narrator	Mapes	He wanted us to pass judgment over him for what he had done. Us judge him? How could any of us judge him? Who hadn’t done the same thing, sometime or another? We stayed quiet. [MASK] was quiet. His little deputy was quiet.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Yank	[MASK] didn’t hoot like the rest of us. He hollered the way you holler at a rodeo when somebody’s riding a bucking horse. “Ya-hoo,” and shot. They had spread out good, and now all the way down the quarters they was hooting and shooting.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Candy	I had barely stopped the car when I saw [MASK] coming out into the road. She seemed calm, not nearly as excited as I thought she should be. Surely not nearly as worried as I was. “I’m glad you got here,” she said.
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Mathu	She hadn’t witnessed it, she was born too late to witness it, but she had heard about what had happened. She had heard about it from [MASK], from the rest of us—and she knowed he was telling the truth.
<name>Me</name>	Me	Fix	If I was going to be in it, then they all would be in it. And if I had to slap her around to let her know she was going to be in it, then that was just too bad. “Who don’t like [MASK]?”
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Gil	No form of life was on the water itself. No animals, no birds, nothing green. Only twigs and dry leaves that had fallen from the trees along the bank. [MASK] was looking out of the window at the bayou, but never saying anything.
<name>Johnse</name>	Johnse	Mathu	“I hope I didn’t,” I said, looking at her. “I hope I had never heard of any of you.” I looked across the toes of those cowboy boots at [MASK] squatting there with that shotgun. He had lit another cigarette.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Gil	We hadn’t been there half a minute when I saw a skinny little guy coming out of the weeds with a pistol dangling from his right hand. He was looking suspiciously at us until he recognized [MASK]; then you could see him smiling.
<name>Rocky</name>	Rocky	Fix	[MASK] looked up at him, nodding his head; then he looked around at the rest of the people in the room. “And the rest of you, how you feel?” he asked. “You feel that this, this butcher and this, this All-American got a point?”
<name>Tebow</name>	Tebow	Gil	Driving across campus, I had to drive about one mile an hour because of all the loonies who recognized [MASK] and wanted to wish him well in the game the next day. These were not all students, either.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Gable	Last person in the world any of us woulda expected to see today was [MASK]. “He wasn’t but sixteen years old, half out his mind, still they put him in the ’lectric chair on the word of a poor white trash.
<name>Candy</name>	Candy	Shaking	“[MASK] there like a scared old nigger. Now you know how a old nigger feel. Look at him, look at him.” I wouldn’t look around, so he moved down the bar to face me. He started pointing his finger and laughing at me.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Gil	[MASK] leaned over and kissed her. He said something to her that I didn’t understand; then after speaking to the younger woman, he spoke and shook hands with two or three of the other men in the room. The men shook hands, nodded, and spoke quietly.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Mathu	He had to go farther up the highway for another load. He told us to wait for them at the graveyard, and we would all walk up to [MASK]’s house together. He thought that would look better than if we straggled in one or two at a time.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Candy	“Didn’t you hear them?” “I heard them.” “You still say you did it?” “I did it.” “You’re lying, [MASK]. You know I know you’re lying.” She got angry now.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mapes	“Well?” [MASK] said. He shook his head, which was still bowed. “I ain’t got nothing to say, Sheriff.” And down he went again. He sat up just as he had done before, and stared down at the ground.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Beatrice	“I’ve never liked him. Why we ever let that kind on this land, I don’t know. The land has not been the same since they brought those tractors here.” “[MASK], please shut up,” I said.
<name>he</name>	he	Jack	“In the end, it’s people like us, you and I, who pay for this.” “Sure,” [MASK] said. “But I’ve been paying my share seventy years already. How long have you been paying yours?”
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Robert	Never a word. Damn if I didn’t think I was in a morgue instead of a bar. Went on like that fifteen, twenty minutes—till [MASK] came in again. I was so glad to see him I almost offered him a free beer.
<name>Someone</name>	Someone	Mapes	I told her that I would keep her posted on anything that went on around here. She said she was not leaving. I asked her why did she need me then. She said she just needed me. [MASK] was on the other side of the steps.
<name>the police</name>	the police	Mapes	“No more speeches. I have to report to [MASK]. I’ll be out there in the car if you want to talk.” He left the porch, loosening his tie. Halfway to the road, he had already taken off the tie and the coat.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Mathu	“Now, get away from there.” [MASK] was squatting against the wall with that double-barrel shotgun in his arms. He had on that old gray hat that was the color of the ground. He had on a dirty white tee shirt and green pants.
<name>the hearse</name>	the hearse	Herman	But I don’t suppose she realizes that.” He looked at me to see if I had any comments. I had nothing to say. He looked past me. “Well, here comes [MASK],” he said. The hearse drove slowly down the road.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Beau	We have law out there to do what many of these people would like to see us do. Some of these in the room with us right now.” “These people are your friends. My friends, [MASK]’s friends.”
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Lou	I want an hour jump on him at least. I want [MASK] here before he gets here. I want more people here with twelve-gauge shotguns, and number five shells. Empty number five shells. Empty. Now, you don’t have much time.
<name>Papa</name>	Papa	Clabber	[MASK]’s head and face from this distance was all one color—white white. What he had a gun for, only God knows. He couldn’t stop blinking long enough to sight, let alone kill somebody.
<name>Ma'am</name>	Ma'am	Mister	“And what I just told you no more than a minute ago about saying [MASK] and Miss round me?” She looked at me hard a long time. That’s how they do when they want you to remember something.
<name>Antonio</name>	Antonio	Mapes	You had to live here seventy-seven years to don’t see it now. No, Sheriff, you don’t see. You don’t even know what I don’t see.” “Do you know what you don’t see?” [MASK] asked him.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Gil	Then his head began moving back and forth, back and forth, so slightly, though, that it was almost unnoticeable. The longer he looked at [MASK], the more his head moved back and forth. His dark pig eyes narrowed to where they were almost closed.
<name>Timshel</name>	Timshel	Beau	“To protect me, I suppose.” “Since when?” She couldn’t answer that. I looked down at [MASK], at the flies gathered on his chest. “Can’t somebody at least bring something out here to cover him up?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Mathu	[MASK] was one of them blue-black Singaleese niggers. Always bragged about not having no white man’s blood in his veins. He looked down on all the rest of us who had some, and the more you had, the more he looked down on you.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Snookum	She just looked at him like they did not belong on the same planet at the same time. [MASK] held out his hand, waiting. His little black face dusty, his twisted little curls dusty, the little hand grimy.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Fix	She had been quiet a long time, but never once raised her head to look at anyone. [MASK] looked at the little boy in his lap and patted him on the leg. “You know this little boy I’m holding here?”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Beau	I took the gun and swung round, and I told [MASK] to stop. I told him more than once to stop. He kept on coming toward the garry. He knowed I had never done nothing like that, never even thought about doing nothing like that.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Snookum	Y’all hear me? A man come back. Not no nigger boy. A nigger boy run and run and run. But a man come back. I’m a man.” [MASK] brought the water jug and a glass.
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Mapes	“I hear there’s a law against kidnapping people. Especially on their own place.” “There’s a law against harboring a murderer, too,” [MASK] said. “You ever heard of that law?” I didn’t answer him.
<name>Old Man</name>	Old Man	Mat	He didn’t look at me when he said it, but I knowed he was talking to me. I went on looking at my line. “That’s what they say,” I said. [MASK] went on looking at his line awhile.
<name>Stradlater</name>	Stradlater	Hilly	[MASK] looked at me. He wasn’t much older than we were. He had red hair and freckles. He didn’t wear a cap or a tie. The two top buttons of his shirt were unfastened, and you could see the reddish hair just below his neck.
<name>Ignatius</name>	Ignatius	Gil	[MASK] kept his head down. He would not look out at the loonies. I was driving one mile an hour. About a dozen other cars driving one mile an hour behind me. Out on the Highland road, I could speed up some, driving about five miles an hour.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Clatoo	“Give me one more minute, one more minute, and I’ll shut up if you want me to shut up,” he said. We all got quiet. “Now, y’all heard the man,” [MASK] said.
<name>Boo</name>	Boo	Tucker	All this time, he had been standing to the side, looking mad, but staying quiet. “I bet you wouldn’t be talking to me like that.” “And what would you do, you little no-butt nothing?” [MASK] said to the little deputy.
<name>partner</name>	partner	Gil	He came over to the car to look inside at us. “Didn’t know it was you,” he said. “Sorry what happened, [MASK].” He looked at me and nodded, and I nodded back. I thought he looked too pale to be a policeman.
<name>Bubba</name>	Bubba	Bing	“Don’t make me mad now. You know me when I get mad.” “Sure, sure,” [MASK] said. “But you can’t hit the broad side of a barn with a cannon. Everybody on the bayou know that.”
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Mapes	She sat on the passenger side, and I was in the other seat beside her. I had tried several times to speak to her, but she refused to answer. [MASK] came out of the yard and went by the car without saying anything to us.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Mapes	“What is going on here, [MASK]?” he asked. He said it as if he had just come into the yard and didn’t know a thing. “What is going on here?” “What is going on?”
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Candy	She started back to the house. I looked at her through the gate. “You getting me some tea cakes?” I called to her. “[MASK] didn’t pay me nothing to come up here.” She didn’t answer me. Just kept on walking.
<name>The Judge</name>	The Judge	Gil	His face was big, red, with heavy jowls; his eyes were the color of cement. Even when he was trying to be gentle, his eyes still remained hard and staring at you. [MASK] stared back at him.
<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Griffin	Dishing out sandwiches and fussing. “I hope you like ham and cheese, because there isn’t anything else. Just look at that. I mean just look at that. Hurry up with that other basket,” she said, over her shoulder to [MASK].
<name>Darry</name>	Darry	Jesse	If I can’t stop you, I bet you I’ll call your brother. He’ll stop you.” “You and [MASK] both better stay out of my way if you know what’s good for you,” I said, looking up the road.
<name>Pharaoh</name>	Pharaoh	Mapes	He was the last black man round here trying to sharecrop on this place. The last one to fight against that tractor out there.” Some of us looked at the tractor and the two loads of cane. [MASK] didn’t; he was looking down at the ground.
<name>Atticus</name>	Atticus	Gilly	“I won’t ever forget this day, ever. But [MASK] is right. We have law out there to do what many of these people would like to see us do. Some of these in the room with us right now.” “These people are your friends.
<name>Bubba</name>	Bubba	Mapes	He didn’t even look at [MASK]. He was over by the garden fence, looking down the quarters toward the fields. “The 369th was a all-colored outfit. You couldn’t fight side by side with these here white folks then.
<name>her</name>	her	Candy	he asked [MASK]. He did not look directly at her, he spoke to her from the side. Already he seemed to suspect that she had something to do with all these people being here. “I don’t know how many there are,” she said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Mapes	“No, I’m not going to hit anybody. I’m going home. If I stay down here any longer, I know I’ll go mad.” She left the yard. [MASK] caught up with her just as she crossed the ditch.
<name>Sniper</name>	Sniper	Fix	Everyone watched the dust rising over the weeds, but no one moved from his place. I supposed they figured that it was still too much light for [MASK] to show up, and even if he did, they would have time to scatter before he took aim.
<name>Caleb</name>	Caleb	Clatoo	[MASK] had already told us where he had put that box of shells, and every time one of us went to the toilet, and didn’t catch the white folks watching us, we ducked down by the side of the house and got a couple shells out of that box.
<name>the mountains</name>	the mountains	Morgan	If I turnt and went toward [MASK], something stopped me. If I went toward that highway on the back, something there stopped me, too. Something like a wall, a wall I couldn’t see, but it stopped me every time.
<name>Lucas</name>	Lucas	Snookum	He took the jug and raised it to his mouth, and he didn’t bring it down until it was empty. He handed [MASK] the empty jug. “I’m a man, Sheriff” he said. “That’s why I come back.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Charlie	“I’ll write it, [MASK],” I said, looking up at him. He was three or four inches taller than I, and outweighed me, I’m sure, by at least a hundred pounds. “I’m a man,” he said.
<name>Armand</name>	Armand	Russ	Through the screen, I could see the sun going down behind the trees on the other side of the bayou. A thin purple cloud lay across the sun, making the sky look like a nice, serene painting. “You had to do what you did,” [MASK] said.
<name>John</name>	John	Mapes	He said it as if he had just come into the yard and didn’t know a thing. “What is going on here?” “What is going on?” [MASK] asked himself. He looked around at the old men with the guns.
<name>Caroline</name>	Caroline	Mathu	She was no more than five or six when her mother and father were killed in a car wreck, and I had helped raise her. Surely, [MASK] here in the quarters, and I at the main house had done as much to raise her as had her uncle and aunt.
<name>Red</name>	Red	Yank	[MASK] was in his early seventies, but he still thought he was a cowboy. He used to break horses and mules thirty, forty years ago, and he still wore the same kinda clothes he wore back then. His straw hat was draped like a cowboy hat.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Chimley	Had never done what we was thinking about doing now. Maybe we had thought about it. Sure, we had thought about it. But we had never done it. “What you say, [MASK]?” he said. I nodded to him.
<name>Fonzie</name>	Fonzie	Russ	But [MASK] was too cool for that. “You see the psychology behind it all?” he said to me. But I kept my mouth shut. I wasn’t going to say a word while those two were standing there.
<name>Walter</name>	Walter	Bea	I turned her loose, and she started rubbing the side of her neck. “I’m going in there and get that number out the phone book,” I told her. “You and [MASK] think up some more names. Think up a dozen of them.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Mathu	[MASK] had knelt down ’side him and raised his head out of the dust. They had really got him. Right in the belly. He laid there like a big old bear looking up at us. He was trying to say something, but it never came out.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Cal	He was staring down at the ground, rubbing his fists, rubbing his knuckles hard, like he was trying to rub off the skin. [MASK] put his hand on one shoulder, and I took the other arm.
<name>Mom</name>	Mom	Ma’am	I had noticed her face trembling, but I hadn’t expected her to hit me. I raised my hand quickly, but I stopped it in midair. And instead of hitting her back, I rubbed the side of my face. “Thank you, [MASK],” I told her.
<name>Godot</name>	Godot	Gil	Everybody waited for [MASK] to go on. The woman on the bed who had been crying was quiet. The younger woman kept her arm around her. The people in the other room were not talking as much as before.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Gil	Halfway to the road, he had already taken off the tie and the coat. He hung them on a hanger in the back seat of the car; then he got in front to speak on the radio. “He is right, [MASK],” I said.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Gil	He was trying to show sympathy. But that was hard to do with a face and eyes like his. [MASK] didn’t answer this time either. He was doing everything he could to control himself. He wanted the sheriff to say more about his brother.
<name>the police</name>	the police	Mapes	He came in with the gun ready to shoot, and she stopped him. These other people heard about it and thought there would be trouble, and had come here to stand with her. She said she had already said all of that to [MASK].
<name>Ma	Ma	Mathu	I listened good, but I could see from the start she was lying. For one thing, I knowed what [MASK] meant to that family, and specially to her. Besides that, she was trying too hard to make me believe her.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Tucker	Not loud. Quiet. He was starting to feel what was going on. If he felt it right, he knowed he had to wait. He kept the Life Saver quiet, waiting. Then [MASK] spoke up.
<name>Godfather</name>	Godfather	Candy	I told him he was go’n die soon, and he could die in jail soon as he could die in this old house. I told him he was my parrain, and he ought to take the blame for me. I told him [MASK] would protect him no matter what.
<name>Clatoo</name>	Clatoo	Candy	I didn’t even know if they was home. You had too much weeds and bushes even to see the houses sometime. I just hollered names; running, spanking my butt, and hollering names. “[MASK] want y’all at Mathu’s house!
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Mapes	Everybody was tired, but nobody was thinking about going home—not yet. Not till this was settled and over with. “Look like you boys put on your brave hats just a little too late,” [MASK] said.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person sitting in the other seat.)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female person sitting in the other seat.)	Candy	I looked at [MASK] sitting over in the other seat. “Maybe you don’t know it,” I told her. “But after tonight there’s going to be a big change in your life. That old man is free of you now.
<name>Chief</name>	Chief	Henry	“Satisfied now, fucker?” [MASK] said. He got crazy with his sniveling now. He was all bent over with his sniveling. Just coughing and spitting. If the niggers didn’t know where we were before, they sure knew where we were now.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Mat	Now, when we’re old men, we get to be brave? I didn’t know how to answer him. All I knowed, I had to go if he went. [MASK] started toward his house, and I went on in the yard.
<name>Dally</name>	Dally	Rufe	“Yes, sir, I figured that’s all you would see. But what do the rest don’t see? What y’all don’t see, [MASK]?” he asked me. He didn’t look at me, still looking up the quarters.
<name>Curley</name>	Curley	Mapes	After they had driven off, [MASK] took off his hat and wiped the sweatband. He wiped his face and neck while he looked at the people on the porch. “All right,” he said when he had put the hat back on.
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Clatoo	Five or six of us raised our guns and shot. A few pecans, a few acorns, some moss and leaves fell down on the sunked-in graves under the trees. “Anybody got anything to say ’fore we get started?” [MASK] asked.
<name>Aunt</name>	Aunt	Bea	[MASK] asked, looking up at me. Her little overpowdered white face was as wrinkled as a prune. Her blue-dyed hair was so thin you could see her gray skull. Only her grayish-blue eyes were still alive and youthful, but now angry.
