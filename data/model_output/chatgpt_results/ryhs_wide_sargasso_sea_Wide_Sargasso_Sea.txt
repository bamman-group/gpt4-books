<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Christophine	“But I cannot go. He is my husband after all.” She [[MASK]] spat over her shoulder. “All women, all colours, nothing but fools. ... [I have] no husband, I thank my God. I keep my money.
<name>her</name> (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female pronoun)	her (There is no proper name in this sentence, the [MASK] refers to a female pronoun)	Antoinette	“You haven’t yet told me exactly what you did with my—with [MASK].’ ‘Yes I tell you. I make her sleep.’ ‘What? All the time?’ ‘No, no.
<name>Dionysus</name>	Dionysus	Love	“I was a god myself last night I’ve tamed and changed a wild girl” Or taken my hurt darling in my arms (Conquered at last. And silent. Mine) Perhaps [MASK] would have smiled then Shown us the way Across that sea.
<name>Sebastian</name>	Sebastian	Emile	Not only wild but menacing. Those hills would close in on you. ‘What an extreme green,' was all I could say, and thinking of [MASK] calling to the fishermen and the sound of his voice, I asked about him. They take short cuts.
<name>Richard</name>	Richard	Annette	He was white and he did not make a sound, but his head hung back over her arm as if he had no life at all and his eyes were rolled up so that you only saw the whites. My stepfather said, ‘[MASK], you are hurt—your hands . . .’
<name>Moira</name>	Moira	Rupert	It’s a pretty name eh—[MASK]—but where they get it from? I think it’s from old time they get it.8 ‘That doctor an old-time doctor. These new ones I don’t like them. First word in their mouth is police.
<name>Mrs. Coulter</name>	Mrs. Coulter	Baptiste	Don’t you know that this is a dangerous place? And that the dark forest always wins? Always. If you don’t, you soon will, and I can do nothing to help you. [MASK] looked very different. Not a trace of the polite domestic.
<name>Zaroff</name>	Zaroff	Baptiste	‘Who is that for?’ I said. He didn’t answer. ‘No road?’ I said and laughed. ‘I don’t want to know nothing about all this,’ he said. ‘[MASK]!’
<name>Stephanie</name>	Stephanie	Coward	What was the use of telling her that I’d been awake before and heard my mother screaming ‘Qui est lei? Qui est la?’, then ‘Don’t touch me. I’ll kill you if you touch me. [MASK]. Hypocrite.
<name>Timothy</name>	Timothy	Pierre	She looked thin and old and her hair wasn’t arranged prettily so I shut my eyes, not wanting to see her. ‘[MASK] is dead, isn’t he?’ ‘He died on the way down, the poor little boy,’ she said.
<name>Jamaica Kincaid</name>	Jamaica Kincaid	Rhys	The first approach draws upon and develops European literary and psychological notions of “character” and “self” and so misses the implications of the Caribbean context of [MASK]’s writing and her identity as a West Indian writer critical of the colonizing countries’ concepts and values even if governed by them.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Antoinette	It is thus significant that, when told that the garden had not been wild before and had been cared for, [MASK] finds that she cannot remember the garden any other way than in its present “chaos.” # # $ Closely linked with the Edenic symbol is the myth of the fall.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Baptiste	There was no answer so I asked [MASK] to bring me something to eat. He was sitting under the Seville orange tree at the end of the veranda. He served the food with such a mournful expression that I thought these people are very vulnerable.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Baptiste	Here’s a cloudy day to help you. No brazen sun. No sun . . . No sun. The weather’s changed. # [MASK] was waiting and the horses saddled. That boy stood by the clove tree and near him the basket he was to carry.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Charlotte	She burns the house and kills herself (bravo!) very soon. I think she would become first a legend, then a monster, quickly. [MASK] may or may not have heard the legend but that is guesswork and impertinent because really I don’t know.
<name>the baby</name>	the baby	Paul	There is no “other” language yet, only a rejection of an unnamed fear through throwing off her bedsheet, a physical act that will later be beyond her.2 It is significant, moreover, that the mother silences her and chides her for disturbing [MASK].’
<name>Heathcliff</name>	Heathcliff	Pierre	She laid [MASK] on the sofa, bent over him, then lifted up her skirt, stepped out of her white petticoat and began to tear it into strips. ‘She left him, she ran away and left him alone to die,’ said my mother, still whispering.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Baptiste	[MASK] came running along the veranda. I got out of the hammock and went to the sitting-room. He had opened the chest and taken out a bottle of rum. Some of this he poured into a decanter which he put on a tray with a glass.
<name>You</name>	You	Tou	‘How do you know that I was not harmed?’ she said. ‘We were so poor then,’ she told him, ‘we were something to laugh at. But we are not poor now,’ she said. [MASK] are not a poor man.
<name>Mayella</name>	Mayella	Rochester	I looked away first and she smiled to herself’ (73) [43], Her second encounter is presented by [MASK] as even more clearly threatening to him. She hands him coffee, calling it “bull’s blood.”
<name>Joan</name>	Joan	Louise	But outside I could see cool, blue shadow on a white wall. My needle is sticky, and creaks as it goes in and out of the canvas. ‘My needle is swearing,’ I whisper to [MASK], who sits next to me.
<name>Mrs. Fairfax</name>	Mrs. Fairfax	Christophine	“Yes, that was her advice.’ ‘I want to do the best for both of us,’ I said. ‘So much of what you tell me is strange, different from what I was led to expect. Don’t you feel that perhaps [MASK] is right?
<name>Sister</name>	Sister	Sandi	[MASK] caught him up before he reached the corner. The girl had disappeared. I didn’t wait to see what happened but I pulled and pulled at the bell. At last the door opened. The nun was a coloured woman and she seemed displeased.
<name>Hamnet</name>	Hamnet	Antoinette	It is still night and I am walking towards the forest. I am wearing a long dress and thin slippers, 7. His son, [MASK]’s stepbrother. so I walk with difficulty, following the man who is with me and holding up the skirt of my dress.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Antoinette	No one was about. The kitchen door was shut and the place looked deserted. I went up the steps and along the veranda and when I heard voices stopped behind the door which led into [MASK]’s room. I could see it reflected in the looking-glass.
<name>Lola</name>	Lola	Annette	‘Oh I agree,’ the other one said, ‘but [MASK] is such a pretty woman. ' nd what a dancer. Reminds me of that song “light as cotton blossom die something breeze”, or is it air? I forget.’
<name>Lenore</name>	Lenore	Sophie	[MASK]!” I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen up in bed; I bent forward: first, surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins.
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Christophine	And I hear well when you tell her that you don’t love her—quite calm and cool you tell her so, and undo all the good I do.’ ‘The good you did! I'm very weary of your nonsense, [MASK].
<name>Joyce</name>	Joyce	Antoinette	Thus [MASK] finally writes herself, as she has always wanted to do (“I will write my name in fire red,” 54 [32], she says of her needlework), with fire, traditionally linked with woman: Fire is source and symbol of energy, of gynergy.
<name>Pa</name>	Pa	Sandi	As we were walking home I asked her who had taught her to aim so well. 'Oh, [MASK] taught me, a boy you never met.’ Every evening we saw the sun go down from the thatched shelter she called the ajoupa,6 I the summer house.
<name>Marla</name>	Marla	Leah	Her name is [MASK]. I listen but I cannot understand what they say. So there is still the sound of whispering that I have heard all my life, but these are different voices. When night comes, and she has had several drinks and sleeps, it is easy to take the keys.
<name>Beckett</name>	Beckett	Rhys	But it is important to understand the specific difference of this estrangement, that as outsiders among already eccentric texts, [MASK]’s novels portray an absence rather than loss of identity and the homelessness of one who never had a home.
<name>Chelone</name>	Chelone	Amelie	[MASK] took her shoes off, tied them together and hung them round her neck. She balanced her small basket on her head and swung away as easily as the porters. We mounted, turned a corner and the village was out of sight. A cock crowed loudly9
<name>Uncle Axel</name>	Uncle Axel	Daniel	The black and gilt clock on a shelf struck four. I must go. I must get away from his yellow sweating face and his hateful little room. 1 sat still, numb, staring at him. ‘You like my clock?' said [MASK].
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Antoinette	His early hopes and promises, to [MASK], of “happiness” in this inauspicious marriage are as fragile as his sense of his own reality — and little less so than hers. The passion they share at first, sharing the sun, is sure to recoil upon her.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Baptiste	I lay and listened for the sound I knew I should hear, the horse’s hoofs as my wife left the house. I turned over and slept till [MASK] woke me with coffee. His face was gloomy. ‘The cook is leaving,’ he announced.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Christophine	[MASK] got in. ‘Now you,’ he said to my mother. But she had turned and was looking back at the house and when he put his hand on her arm, she screamed. One woman said she only come to see what happen.
<name>John</name>	John	Antoinette	The concluding passage of the novel, narrated by [MASK], reads as follows: Now at last I know why I was brought here and what I have to do. There must have been a draught for the flame flickered and 1 thought it was out.
<name>Agatha</name>	Agatha	Christophine	‘Come in,’ she called and [MASK] came in with our coffee on a tray. She was dressed up and looking very imposing. The skirt of her flowered dress trailed after her making a rustling noise as she walked and her yellow silk turban was elaborately tied.
<name>Billy</name>	Billy	Pierre	‘Did you have a nightmare?’ “Yes, a bad dream.’ She sighed and covered me up. “You were making such a noise. I must go to [MASK], you’ve frightened him.’ I lay thinking, ‘I am safe.
<name>Tante Atie</name>	Tante Atie	Doudou	Like a doll. Even when she threatened me with the bottle she had a marionette quality. ‘Ti moun,’ I heard and ‘[MASK] che,’ and the end of a head handkerchief made a finger on the wall. ‘Do do I’enfant do.
<name>Angel</name>	Angel	Christophine	[MASK] help me and looking behind me I saw that I had been helped. There was a wall of fire protecting me but it was too hot, it scorched me and I went away from it. . . . (WSS, 189 [112]; emphasis mine.)
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Christophine	Didn’t anybody hear?’ Before I could stop her she darted to the table and seized the bottle of rum. ‘Don’t drink any more,’ I said. ‘And what right have you to tell me what I’m to do? [MASK]!’
<name>Miss Emily</name>	Miss Emily	Amelie	She raised her eyebrows and the comers of her mouth turned down in a questioning mocking way. For a moment she looked very much like [MASK]. Perhaps they are related, I thought. It’s possible, it’s even probable in this damned place.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Antoinette	[MASK] called in a high voice. “Yes, mistress.’ He looked straight at me and carried the tray out. As for the old woman, I saw her shadow before I saw her. She too passed me without turning her head.
<name>Eurydice</name>	Eurydice	Antoinette	And an intoxicating freshness as if all this had never been breathed before. When [MASK] said ‘Come, I will show you the house’ I went with her unwillingly for the rest of the place seemed neglected and deserted. She led me into a large unpainted room.
<name>Janie</name>	Janie	Antoinette	I try, but no. They won’t let [MASK] see her. In the end—mad I don’t know —she give up, she care for nothing. That man who is in charge of her he take her whenever he want and his woman talk.
<name>Yunior</name>	Yunior	Taste	A bamboo spout jutted from the cliff, the water coming from it was silver blue. She dismounted quickly, picked a large shamrock-shaped leaf to make a cup and drank. Then she picked another leaf, folded it and brought it to me. ‘[MASK].
<name>Ishmael</name>	Ishmael	Rochester	Before [MASK] can begin to exercise his power to ward off the threat of assimilation, he must first rationalize to the reader (for his narrative is clearly aimed at an audience) his rejection of the apparently innocent young woman whom he has married.
<name>Chinua</name>	Chinua	Tve	151-74). [MASK] had that already/ ‘No limit to times you catch fever/ There was no one on the veranda and no sound from the house. We both stood in the road looking up, then he said, ‘I send the girl to you, master/
<name>Zora</name>	Zora	Laroche	Her finally victorious struggle against European-colonial imposition of the zombi state — her ultimate regaining of an identity stolen by cultural imperialism —becomes, in [MASK]’s terms, an American myth in an African-derived idiom; her final realization and action become an American battle against a European colonialism.
<name>Nietzsche</name>	Nietzsche	Myth	[MASK] teaches us that sovereign gods and sovereign institutions are partial, partial in the sense that they are biased, but when they begin to penetrate their biases, they also begin to transform their fear of the other, of others, of other parts, in a larger complex of wholeness.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Christophine	The subsequent traversal of that gap by [MASK]’s references to the old times, then (“New ones worse than old ones —more cunning, that’s all”), only marks out what is not there and makes plain the impossibility of any appeal to the past against an equally feared future.
<name>Miss Brill</name>	Miss Brill	Christophine	but I saw nobody, nothing but shadows. I left a light on the chair by my bed and waited for [MASK], for I liked to see her last thing. But she did not come, and as the candle burned down, the safe peaceful feeling left me.
<name>Faulkner</name>	Faulkner	Rhys	The larger social context of these literary movements gives meaning to both tire distorting mirror of the text and the truths we may see in it, and a sociocritical perspective can give us the wide focus we need to see the multiple contexts of [MASK]’s writing.
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Amelie	[MASK], who had been sitting with her back to us, turned round. Her expression was so full of delighted malice, so intelligent, above all so intimate that I felt ashamed and looked away. ‘Well,’ I thought. ‘I have had fever.
<name>Edna</name>	Edna	Antoinette	[MASK]’s third and final dream is the locus of her awakening. She is able to accomplish this by finally answering the two questions set her by her personal and historical situation: “Qui est la?” and “You frightened?”
<name>Othello</name>	Othello	Love	Was [MASK]’s dark face “And cruel as he is”? I’ve never known that I tried my best you may be certain (whoever asks) My human best If the next morning as I looked at what I’d done (He was watching us mockingly, used to these games)
<name>John</name>	John	Christophine	Better. Don’t think I frightened of you either.’ ‘So she ran off to tell you I’d ill-treated her, did she? I ought to have guessed that.’ ‘She don’t tell me a thing,’ said [MASK].
<name>Emily's</name>	Emily's	Pierre	‘He does not look hurt,’ I argued. ‘Great mistake to go by looks,’ she said, ‘one way or the other.’ I went into [MASK]’s room which was next to mine, the last one in the house.
<name>Consuela</name>	Consuela	Josephine	SP, pp. 47-50. Jesus). She was sad and unsmiling and I was vaguely sorry for her and wished she was happier. [MASK] the cook was a Dominican. A tall, good-looking woman who kept herself very much to herself.
<name>Pablo</name>	Pablo	Christophine	The flowers that open at night are called moonflowers. but I asked [MASK] to open it because the breeze comes from the hills at night. The land breeze. Not from the sea. It was so hot that my night chemise1 was sticking to me
<name>Lucie</name>	Lucie	Antoinette	She was a fighter, I had to admit. Against my will I repeated, ‘Do you wish to say good-bye to [MASK]?’ ‘I give her something to sleep—nothing to hurt her. I don’t wake her up to no misery.
<name>Elizabeth</name>	Elizabeth	Jane	I forget she knows nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain [MASK] will agree with me in opinion when she knows all that I know!
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Lord	Why don’t you give me an answer when I write to you the first time?’ He went on talking, his eyes fixed on a framed text hanging on the dirty white wall, ‘Vengeance is Mine’.9 Tou take too long, [MASK],’ he told it.

<name>Coco</name>	Coco	Coco	I won’t allow it.’ She did not answer, only fought him silently, twisting like a cat and showing her teeth. Our parrot was called [MASK], a green parrot. He didn’t talk very well, he could say Qui est la?
<name>he</name>	he	Judas	Nearby a cock crew and I thought, ‘That is for betrayal, but who is the traitor?’ She did not want to do this. 1 forced her with my ugly money. And what does anyone know about traitors, or why [MASK] did what he did?7
<name>she</name>	she	Christophine	Similarly, she does not ask her mother what would happen if [MASK] left. When a black girl calls her a “white cockroach,” she is terrified and creeps away to hide against the wall, a premonition of her own reshaping through language.
<name>Georgiana</name>	Georgiana	Antoinette	“You’ll get soaked, [MASK],’ I said. ‘No, the rain is stopping.’ She held up the skirt of her riding habit and ran across the street. I watched her critically. She wore a tricorne hat5 6 which became her.
<name>Mrs. Runcie</name>	Mrs. Runcie	Meta	My nurse, who was called [MASK], didn’t like me much anyway, and complete with a book it was too much. One day she found me crouched on the staircase reading a bowdlerised version of the Arabian Nights in very small print. 1.
<name>Mrs. Blandish</name>	Mrs. Blandish	Godfrey	‘The devil prince of this world,’ [MASK] said, ‘but this world don’t last so long for mortal man.’ She persuaded a Spanish Town doctor to visit my younger brother Pierre who staggered when he walked and couldn’t speak distinctly.
<name>Helena</name>	Helena	Antoinette	[MASK]’s embroidering the year of her time in the convent thus suggests an attempt to fix time, a time which, since the arrival of the “new Luttrells,” has been set in motion again: “I woke next morning knowing that nothing would be the same.
<name>anyone</name>	anyone	Grace	Looking at the tapestry one day I recognized my mother dressed in an evening gown but with bare feet. She looked away from me, over my head just as she used to do. I wouldn’t tell [MASK] this.
<name>Molly</name>	Molly	Antoinette	‘She creep and crawl like centipede.’ She kissed [MASK] on the cheek. Then she looked at me, shook her head, and muttered in patois before she went out. ‘Did you hear what that girl was singing?’
<name>Catherine</name>	Catherine	Antoinette	Also significant here is [MASK]’s changed surname, part of the ritual of Anglo-American marriage. now like I hate you and before I die I will show you how much I hate you/ Then to my astonishment she stopped crying and said, ‘Is she so much prettier than I am?

<name>Irene</name>	Irene	Antoinette	(483) [27] Having been subjected both to her mother’s attempts to make her “white” and to the metropolitan view that the effort is a failure, [MASK] will try to be black, not an anomalous “white nigger.”
<name>Mr. McGregor</name>	Mr. McGregor	Antoinette	She gave me a bulky envelope addressed in careful copperplate. ‘By hand. Urgent’ was written in the corner. ‘One of our hermit neighbours,’ I thought. ‘And an enclosure for [MASK].’
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Hilda	The house was swept and dusted very early, usually before I woke. [MASK] brought coffee and there were always two roses on the tray. Sometimes she’d smile a sweet childish smile, sometimes she would giggle very loudly and rudely, bang the tray down and run away.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Antoinette	‘But I was laughing at myself, [MASK].’ She looked at me and I took her in my arms and kissed her. You don’t know anything about me,’ she said. ‘I’ll trust you if you’ll trust me.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Tes	[MASK].’ ‘Now look at me,’ she said. “You will not be frightened of me.’ I looked at her. She had large brown eyes, very soft, and was dressed in white, not with a starched apron like the others had.

<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Edward	At the moment of departure [MASK] is “suddenly, bewilderingly . . . certain that everything I had imagined to be truth was false. False. Only the magic and the dream are true —all the rest’s a lie. Let it go. Here is the secret.
<name>Tia</name>	Tia	Christophine	The poor (she too) girl doesn’t know why he’s so suddenly left her in the lurch, so flies off to her nurse (presence explained) for a love drink. From the start it must be made clear that [MASK] is “an obeah woman”.
<name>Julia</name>	Julia	Antoinette	[MASK] ran across the lawn and as I followed her I collided with a boy coming in the opposite direction. He rolled his eyes, looking alarmed and went on towards the horses without a word of apology. A man’s voice said, ‘Double up now double up.
<name>Aunt Augusta</name>	Aunt Augusta	Richard	When I passed her room, I heard her quarrelling with [MASK] and I knew it was about my marriage. 'It’s disgraceful,’ she said. ‘It’s shameful. You are handing over everything the child owns to a perfect stranger.

<name>Dee</name>	Dee	Christophine	‘She got two dresses, wash and wear. You want clean dress to drop from heaven? Some people crazy in truth.’ ‘She must have another dress,’ said my mother. ‘Somewhere.’ But [MASK] told her loudly that it shameful.

<name>Ma</name>	Ma	Christophine	[MASK] helped him with the basket, then she brought out the bottle of white rum and poured out half a tumblerful. He swallowed it quickly. Then she filled the glass with water and he drank that like they do.
<name>Isabella</name>	Isabella	Annette	‘[MASK], be reasonable. You were the widow of a slave-owner, the daughter of a slave-owner, and you had been living here alone, with two children, for nearly five years when we met. Things were at their worst then.

<name>Toni Morrison</name>	Toni Morrison	Rhys	In North American and European psychology, character begins at home, in interaction with a specific family in a particular culture. Yet the characters in [MASK]’s early novels lack homes and homelands. Circumstances and their own actions have isolated them from families, husbands, and friends.
<name>Toni</name>	Toni	Antoinette	The linear time of history, which would inevitably recall the history of slavery to consciousness and thus restore the racial differentiation [MASK]’s narrative seeks to disrupt, must be foreclosed. Thus her two narratives are defined by only two temporal points: ", . .
<name>Freud</name>	Freud	Rochester	The dreams can be seen to weave a female countertext around the “masculine text” of [MASK]’s plot “from dreamer to dreamer, woman to woman,” blending intimate “conversation” with aggressive revision.5 We shall return to the implications of this female “relational” style of revision.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Grace	What am I doing in this place and who am I? The door of the tapestry room is kept locked. It leads, I know, into a passage. That is where [MASK] stands and talks to another woman whom I have never seen.
