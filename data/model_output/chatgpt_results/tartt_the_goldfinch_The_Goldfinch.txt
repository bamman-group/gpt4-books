<name>unknown</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	unknown (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Platt	‘A rope of sand.’ ” “She told me she loved him.” “Well, girls always love assholes,” said [MASK], not bothering to dispute this. “Haven’t you noticed?” No, I thought bleakly, untrue.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Welty	Because, of course, it wasn’t just the ring he had given me. viii. At night, in [MASK]’s old room, which was now my room, his old reading glasses and fountain pens still in the desk drawers, I lay awake listening to the street noise and fretting.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Potter	“I’m not saying a cop. I’m saying drunk tourists. The place is crawling with them Saturday night.” “Ha!” He put the pan down on the floor for the dog to finish off. “Likely you will end up in jail, [MASK].
<name>Howie</name>	Howie	Hiya	He seemed genuinely pleased to see me. “[MASK] doing?” “Fine,” I said, marvelling at how un-stoned I suddenly felt. “And you?” “Can’t complain. Quite a bruise you got going on there, pal.”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Boris	“If you don’t want to come with me, don’t come, okay? But I can’t stand around here all night.” [MASK] — I thought—might ask what was in the pillowcase, particularly since it was so fat and weirdly shaped after my over-enthusiastic wrapping job.
<name>Benjamin</name>	Benjamin	Boris	“Think she’ll give us some?” “She might give you some.” [MASK] sank down to sit on the floor by the bed, with his knee up and his back against the wall. “Do you think she’s selling it?”
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Frantisek	“Right, right,” I said, reaching in the top inside pocket of my jacket for the bank draft and the deposit slip — unfolding them, in what I hoped was a casual way, checking them out before I handed them over— [MASK].
<name>Harriet</name>	Harriet	Theo	Which pieces? How many?” “I don’t know.” “You don’t ^now?” “Well, I do, it’s just that I —” “[MASK], please.” He was angry now; it was a relief.
<name>Finch</name>	Finch	Anton	finch along with relatively recent issue of newspaper to date it, you know. Two years old newspaper but—no matter. [MASK] just happened to find this folder, see, under a chair, with some other documents from the Miami thing, you know, to connect to prior sighting.
<name>Edward</name>	Edward	Hobie	At the back of the room a wall of tarnished old mirrors, hung frame to frame, glowed with the silvered light of old ballrooms and candlelit salons. [MASK] looked back at me. He could see how pleased I was. “You like old things?”
<name>Ivan</name>	Ivan	Boris	[MASK] — ragged and unhinged-looking, his shirt hanging off the shoulder on one side, slamming the cabinets, complaining bitterly because there was no tea—had made some hideous coffee in the Russian way, by boiling grounds in a pan on the stove.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Popchyk	[MASK] — who’d been extremely on edge; he sensed that we were off-key somehow and had been barking at us like we were possessed —went off immediately almost as if he’d expected something of the sort. In an instant, it all came crashing back.
<name>Holmes</name>	Holmes	Boris	with a jolt I realized it was barely dinnertime; it felt like three in the morning. [MASK] had slid in cautiously behind me, hands in the pockets of his overcoat, leaving the front door wide open behind him, eyes on the big basalt urns, the chandelier.
<name>Myron</name>	Myron	Popper	Big night out! Not feeling so hot this morning, though. Please say something,” he blurted when I didn’t reply. “I have been feeling very very bad about this all day.” [MASK] had snuffled across the room to his water dish.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Marco	“Like I said,” he continued in a low voice; I had to walk close beside him in order to hear — “[MASK]’s a good guy, but we had a lot of tenants complaining because the building was understaffed during the, you know.”
<name>Dave</name>	Dave	Hobie	“Well.” I never knew how to respond when people commented, as they often did, on my being “okay.” [MASK] coughed, and put out the cigarette. “Well.” I could see, from his expression, that he knew he
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Bami	Or not so many. This bracelet is from there,” he said, pointing to one of the many black leather strands on his wrist. “My friend [MASK] made it for me. He was our cook.” “What’s it like?”
<name>Henry</name>	Henry	Boris	“I thought you would be pleased. No?” But I had not recovered sufficiently to speak. All I could do was stare, in dumbfoundment. At my expression, [MASK] shook the hair out of his face and laughed. “You gave me the idea yourself.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Kitsey	Supposed to meet a client.” “Will you be coming uptown tonight?” [MASK] shared an apartment in the East Seventies with two roommates, not far from the office of the arts organization where she worked. “Not sure. Might have to go to dinner.
<name>He</name>	He	Platt	“Well —” His lowered voice made me uncomfortable, as if he were seeking my opinion or wanting me to weigh in somehow. “I hope they work better for her than they did for me.” [MASK] opened his mouth and then seemed to reconsider.
<name>Frank</name>	Frank	Platt	“Wow,” I said, after an uncomfortable pause, looking at [MASK]’s big-knuckled hands resting palms down on the table — hands that after all these years still had a blunt, brutal look, a residue of old cruelty about them.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Grisha	[MASK] could back me up on a lot of it without incriminating himself: we’d never discussed it, he’d never questioned me but he’d known it wasn’t kosher, all those hush-hush trips out to the storage unit.
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Boris	He was broadshouldered and bored-looking, in a soft gray coat, and despite his age there was something petulant and cherubic about him, overly ripe, soft white hands and a soft managerial blandness. [MASK] — cigarette in mouth — stood frozen.
<name>Roxy</name>	Roxy	Xandra	Her hair, the color of caramel straw, was very straight and tattered at the ends; she was chewing gum and a strong smell of Juicy Fruit was coming off her. “It’s [MASK] with an X,” she said in a gravelly undertone.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Welty	“But I mean — it’s like [MASK]’s energy, or force field — God that sounds so corny but I don’t know what else you’d call it—it’s been with me from that hour on. I was there for him and he was there for me.
<name>someone</name>	someone	Gyuri	I stood about ten feet away and—despite [MASK], with moneybag, pressing in on me much too close—put on a self-consciously blank expression and pretended to examine the signs and slogans on the wall: Greenpeace, Fur-Free Zone, Vegan Friendly, Protected by Angels!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Boris	“Reason? What reason?” [MASK] seemed about to say something, then changed his mind. “Well, who knows,” he said, lighting a cigarette and taking a sharp drag. “Your dad — he’s part Russian.”
<name>Someone</name> (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Someone (There is no proper name given in the passage)	Grozdan	Laughter and whistles at this. “Shit.” “Where was it? [MASK] didn’t—?” “No. In a — ” he gestured, to indicate a sling—“what do you call it. Hanging under the table, in some cloth like.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Pippa	I said, turning to [MASK]. “Of course she knows me! Knows all about me! We are now dearest of friends! Now—” to me, with a mock show of officiousness — “small word in private. You’ll excuse us please?”
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Boris	“I’ve known some sweet old poofters.” “I don’t think he is,” I said, uncertainly. [MASK] shrugged. “Who cares? If he is good to you? None of us ever find enough kindness in the world, do we?”
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Boris	[MASK] — downing his slug, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand—chucked me gaily in the arm with the bottle while humming we wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmas Package on my knees. Running my hands all around the edge.
<name>Mrs. Pascal</name>	Mrs. Pascal	Goldie	At any rate, the delivery people were hauling the computer out the door again and loading it back into their van when my mother happened to come downstairs and see what was going on. “And she paid herself, that beautiful lady,” [MASK] said.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Hobie	xvi. n T T »» T HT) • » [MASK], 1 said, 1 m in a jam. He glanced up from the Japanned chest he was retouching: roosters and cranes, golden pagodas on black. “Can I help?”
<name>the listener</name>	the listener	Hobie	“No. Should it?” Somewhat erratically—I was dying for a drink; it had been foolish of me not to stop at the bar on the way over — I explained. As I spoke, [MASK]’s face grew blanker and blanker.
<name>Renata</name>	Renata	Boris	“Who’s he going to tell? He is underage and not here legally. He does not speak any proper language.” “[MASK]” — leaning forward slightly; I felt like I was going to pass out—“he’s got the painting.” “Ah.”
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Gyuri	he said, slinging his arm around my shoulder with his head close to mine, exactly as when we were boys. “We can still phone them,” said [MASK], with a shout of laughter, punching me on the other arm.
<name>Becky</name>	Becky	KT	That is what she got for clothes only! Only [MASK] already has so many clothes it is like, why does she need to buy more? Anyway by Christmas for me it was like in the movies where they have the ching-ching and the dollar signs.
<name>Sheila</name>	Sheila	Kotku	He dipped the end of his little finger in, tasted it. “Bingo,” he said, running the finger along his gums. “[MASK]’s going to be pissed she didn’t come over now.” I held out the earrings to him on my open hands.
<name>Daisy</name>	Daisy	Elizabeth	And here is...Oh, [MASK], there you are, let me steal you away for a moment, don’t you look delightful, that blue suits you beautifully, I’d very much like to introduce you to...”
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Boris	“Yes yes,” said [MASK], very earnestly, with a vigorous nod of the head. “She always has to be where there is skiing and—-you know me, I hate the fucking snow, ha! Her father very very right-wing—a Nazi basically.
<name>he</name>	he	Boris	Still shivering with sick, I drank from my hands at the sink and splashed some water on my face. My bare-chested reflection was hunched and pale, and I had a fat lip from where [MASK] had socked me the night before.
<name>Uncle Jack</name>	Uncle Jack	Bobo	Surely father more to me than my own father. [MASK] was always fair to me. More than fair. Kind. I learned a lot from him, watching him in action. So I don’t mind so much wearing this star for him.
<name>Vinny</name>	Vinny	Lidiya	You watch and see-—soon, in four-five years, he will be broke on the street unless he finds someone to run the shop for him.” “Such as who?” “Well—” he shrugged — “some person like maybe my cousin [MASK].
<name>Buck</name>	Buck	Potter	Disdainful look up and down. “You have some place to go?” “As a matter of fact, yes.” “[MASK]—” half-humorously, putting down his bag, feeling my forehead with his knuckles — “you look bad.
<name>Sal</name>	Sal	Xandra	They don’t call him that for nothing! [MASK] was scared to death of him but he didn’t go after her for your dad’s debt, not serious anyway. Not at all. And your dad was in for a lot.
<name>the person</name>	the person	Hobie	“You remember me?” “Are we friends?” “Yes,” I said without thinking, and then glanced back at [MASK], embarrassed I’d lied. “I forgot your name, I’m sorry. I remember your face though.”
<name>Dorothy</name>	Dorothy	Niall	“Nor to me, but I’ve talked to people and so far it checks out.” He spoke with all a junkie’s arrhythmic quiet, off-beat, but without the slur. “So — soon we should know more, I hope.” “Friends of [MASK]’s?”
<name>Mr. Antolini</name>	Mr. Antolini	Kitsey	It had taken everything I had to do it, like an animal gnawing a limb off to escape a trap. And somehow I had done it; and there on the other side was [MASK], looking at me with the amused, gooseberry-gray eyes.
<name>He</name>	He	Reeve	I stopped eating, chopsticks halfway to my mouth. My immediate, unthinking impulse was to get up and walk out of the restaurant but almost as quickly I realized how stupid that would be. [MASK] leaned back in his chair. “You’re not saying anything.”
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Myshkin	Because all [MASK] ever did was good... unselfish... he treated all persons with understanding and compassion and what resulted from this goodness? Murder! Disaster! I used to worry about this a lot. Lie awake at night and worry! Because—why?
<name>my glass</name>	my glass	Popchik	“Eh?” “Walking? To the airport?” “Wait,” I said, putting [MASK] down. All at once I felt sick and like I might vomit red wine all over the carpet. “Will they take a dog on the plane?”
<name>Lauren</name>	Lauren	Boris	Throwing on my robe, cracking the door on the chain I said: “[MASK]?” Moist-faced, uniformed woman. “Laundry, sir.” “Sorry?” “Front desk, sir. They said you asked for laundry pickup this morning.”
<name>Joe</name>	Joe	Bobo	Walk his little dogs! Pick up dry-cleaning! [MASK] was good and generous friend to me at bad time — father almost, I can say this hand on my heart to you and mean it. Surely father more to me than my own father.
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Theo	“[MASK], my God, I’m sorry,” he said. We stood looking at each other for an uncertain moment and then — in an impulsive, what-the-hell movement, so awkward it was almost funny, he reached around and hugged me.
<name>mi amigo</name>	mi amigo	Jose	My father, with his Personable Smile, started to answer but I was too nervous and interrupted: “[MASK]—” I’d been racking my brains for the Spanish on the way over, rehearsing the sentence in my mind — “mi papa quiere entrar en el apartamento, le necesitamos abrir la puerta.”
<name>Huck</name>	Huck	Mouth	[MASK] all git-tering. Like — where you want to lie still and to look at a clock and count your heartbeats? except no place to lie still? and you don’t have a clock? Almost in tears! Didn’t know what to do!
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Boris	“Are you going to let me in?” said [MASK], when finally the elevator doors closed and we were alone. “Or shall we stand here tenderly and gaze?” He smelled rank, as if he hadn’t showered in days, and he looked both faintly contemptuous and very pleased with himself.
<name>she</name>	she	Hobie	“Are you going to take it apart?” Though [MASK] viewed it as an undesirable step I loved the surgical drama of dismembering a piece and re-assembling it from scratch — working fast before the glue set, like doctors rushing through a shipboard appendectomy.
<name>he</name>	he	Mickey	“And the producer, you see—I mean, they all knew how [MASK] was, everyone did, he was already starting to get a reputation for being difficult—” “She didn’t deserve it,” I said aloud, interrupting their conversation.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boris	While [MASK] wasn’t especially tall for his age, the girl was tiny, despite how much older than us she seemed: flat-chested, scrawny-hipped, with high cheekbones and a shiny forehead and a sharp, shiny, triangle-shaped face.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Andy	“Why haven’t you figured out this sailing business then?” “Oh, I’ve figured it out, all right,” said [MASK] grimly, returning to his hiragana workbook. “I’ve figured that I have four summers of Hell, at absolute worst.
<name>Buddy</name>	Buddy	Popchyk	When I let [MASK] loose, he stooped to pat his head, in a posture reminiscent of a lanky cowboy by the campfire. As odd as the stranger looked, with the hair and all, I couldn’t help but admire how easy and comfortable he seemed in his skin.
<name>he</name>	he	Hobie	The library? The loo? I was determined to catch another glimpse of her — just one more—before I left. “Do you know where she is?” I said to [MASK], after making a quick tour around; but he only shook his head.
<name>Frankenstein</name>	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	Coming in, I threw on all the lights—desk lamp, bed lamp, chandelier blazing; shrugged my coat on the floor, and headed straight for the shower, unbuttoning my bloodied shirt as I went, stumbling like [MASK]’s monster before pitchforks.
<name>he</name>	he	Gyuri	I had only just begun to adjust myself to the fact that he was in the room with me. “I thought you were out with some girl. Well — here is where [MASK] and I have been,” he said, when I didn’t answer.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boris	We rolled on our backs and roared with laughter. As weak and nauseated as I felt, I thought I would never be able to stop. [MASK] flopped over, groping with one arm for something on the floor. In an instant his head popped back up.
<name>He</name>	He	Hobie	[MASK], I noticed, was standing discreetly in the hall. “Sorry,” he said, glancing at his wristwatch. “I really hate to rush you—” “Sure,” she said. To me she said: “Goodbye then.
<name>Officer</name>	Officer	Boris	“You cunts are going to be sorry for this,” he said quietly. “Hands, hands,” said [MASK] cordially. “Where I can see them.” “I don’t got a weapon.” “Right there anyway.”
<name>Dickie</name>	Dickie	Boris	[MASK] lit a cigarette. His face was greenish in the subterranean light. “Wrap that thing up,” he said affably, nodding at the painting, “and then we will stick it in the hotel safe and go and get you a real blow job.”
<name>Jesus</name>	Jesus	Potter	Traded? Sold?” “No, of course I — hey—” scraping his chair back hastily — “Jesus, [MASK], calm down. Of course I didn’t sell it. Why would I do any such?” “I don’t know!
<name>Edgar</name>	Edgar	Popper	This is your so-smart plan. Hush,” he said to the dog, who’d barked sharply for more steak. “I wouldn’t steal from some poor working person,” I said, tossing [MASK] a piece of steak myself.
<name>me</name>	me	Platt	Yes,” she said decisively, to [MASK], as if the matter had been settled, folding her hands. “I think that’s an excellent idea. You two go out and get a drink. And you!” she said, turning to me with a smile.
<name>Grace</name>	Grace	Reeve	Sometimes when I woke up the whole thing seemed like a dream, although soon enough I remembered it wasn’t. But it was impossible to even think of going up there with [MASK] like a cat waiting for me to scurry across the floor. I had to sit tight.
<name>Poustyshka</name>	Poustyshka	Popchik	Yes, hello, poustyshka, little bit of fluff you, hello! You remember me, don’t you?” He had toppled over on his back, stretched out and laughing, as [MASK] — still screaming with joy — jumped all over him.
<name>Gatsby</name>	Gatsby	Boris	Nearer, creeping dark from under [MASK]’s car, a glossy satin pool three feet wide was spreading and inching forward like an amoeba, and I wondered how long before it reached my shoe and what I would do when it did.
<name>Scrooge</name>	Scrooge	Boris	If they had any sense, they should never have let us inside. And — yes, I know, only forty thousand, but why should I pay them one cent if I don’t have to? For stealing my own property?” [MASK] chortled.
<name>Tommy</name>	Tommy	Boris	Then, loud as a buzz saw, a blender started up at the bar and seemed to go on for an excessively long time. “You didn’t know?” said [MASK], when the racket finally stopped. In the back room, laughter and clapping.
<name>Marlowe</name>	Marlowe	Boris	But those people down there? Maybe twenty, thirty of them, all men, all living in one house. Drug dealers maybe.” “You think?” “Something very funny going on,” said [MASK] darkly. “That’s all I know.”
<name>him</name>	him	Kits	“Everything okay between you two?” “What?” “You and [MASK] get everything hashed out?” I wasn’t entirely sure how to answer this. After a few moments of silence he pushed a string of gray-blond hair behind one ear.
<name>the speaker</name>	the speaker	Hobie	No need to make any decisions at all at the moment, I shouldn’t think,” he said, with a glance at [MASK]. “I should think it would be fine if you just sat out the rest of this term and we can sort it out later.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Reeve	The waiter disappeared, sliding across the room to talk to the beautiful hostess. [MASK], from his pocket, took out several sheets of folded paper, which he pushed across the tablecloth to me. It was a print-out of a Web page.
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Boris	“Sometimes he lays it on a bit thick.” “Well, yes, is true,” said [MASK] sensibly. He took the cigarette back, inhaled, and then, companionably, passed it to me. “You can have the rest.”
<name>Meursault</name>	Meursault	Boris	Or— like [MASK]—is it better to throw yourself head first and laughing into the holy rage calling your name? It’s not about outward appearances but inward significance. A grandeur in the world, but not of the world, a grandeur that the world doesn’t understand.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Horst	All this time, all this headache, and all this easy, government money right under my nose! I will tell you—” crossing over, pouring me out a noisy glug of red — “in some ways, [MASK] is probably just as glad it fell out like this as you.
<name>the market</name>	the market	Mommy	I mean—” crisply — “I’ll be frank with you. I have another guy I’ve been dealing with, but honestly I’d rather work with you. You know us, you know [MASK], and I know you’ll give me a fair price.”
<name>Holden</name>	Holden	Boris	Where was [MASK]? In my fever haze I tried, unsuccessfully, to amuse or at least divert myself with thoughts of how very likely he was to show up at just the moment you didn’t expect him. Cracking his knuckles, making the girls jump.
<name>backup</name>	backup	Platt	His voice had made me go cold with anger; but knowing I had [MASK] in my corner made me more cocky than I had reason to be. “Returning your call. What’s on your mind?” “Probably not what you think,” came the swift reply.
<name>Hamlet</name>	Hamlet	Theo	Look how open and modern the brushwork is!”). We spent some time in front of a Hals portrait of a boy holding a skull (“Don’t be mad, [MASK], but who do you think he looks like?
<name>Estelle</name>	Estelle	Hobie	See, instead of cashing my check? he’s got some elderly woman lined up, nurses twenty-four hours a day, and what he wants is for us to use her apartment to, uh —” [MASK]’s eyebrows went up. “Plant?”
<name>Manfred</name>	Manfred	Reeve	“Man,” I said, wiping my eyes, “I don’t know what to say. Clearly you are delusional or — I don’t know.” [MASK], to his credit, did not look perturbed, though clearly he wasn’t pleased.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Hobie	Had a sense, you do sometimes, that it wasn’t like they said, you know?” “Sorry?” I said, glancing up, disoriented by the vicious new possibility I’d stumbled into. “A goodbye at the gate,” said [MASK].
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Samantha	“At school? The other gifted boy who was put ahead?” I shook my head. “Sorry?” “[MASK]’s son? Whom you defended from a group of older boys at school? Took beatings for him — that kind of thing?”
<name>Ben</name>	Ben	Jack	Even if I didn’t bang it—[MASK], laboriously, had done the math for me on the inside of a Quarter Pounder wrapper — I would be looking at a much more reasonable expenditure, something in the neighborhood of four hundred and fifty dollars a month.
<name>Jose</name>	Jose	Jose	“jBomba!” cried [MASK], doing a happy step backward when he saw me on the sidewalk; he was the youngest and most buoyant of the doormen, always trying to sneak away before his shift was over to play soccer in the park.
<name>Tom</name>	Tom	Hobie	They were round tortoiseshell, a little too grown-up and expensive-looking, and adults had been going a little too far out of their way to assure me how great they looked. “How are things uptown?” said [MASK].
<name>Carrie</name>	Carrie	Kitsey	“Maybe this will teach you to keep your phone switched on when you’re with him. I’m sure she was trying to call you on the street.” “Sorry, I don’t know—?” “[MASK], I saw you.”
<name>Johnny</name>	Johnny	Boris	All day long she talked to me and sang—taught me the words of all the jukebox songs. ‘Dark in the city, the night is alive..Soon I had developed quite proficiency. Speak English, [MASK]!
<name>Lindsay</name>	Lindsay	Tessa	They’d been crushed morphine tablets and it had been a terrible idea to snort them, total waste of a pill. “And anyway, [MASK] certainly didn’t have any scruples about blow, she used to ask me to get it for her all the time—” “Look, that’s different
<name>Harry</name>	Harry	Jose	But nobody answered at all, for ages, until finally a thin, halting, foreign-sounding voice said: “Hello?” “Is [MASK] there?” “No,” said the voice. “No. You cah back.”
<name>he</name>	he	Larry	We looked at her, frozen. After what seemed like a centuries-long pause, she opened her mouth, closed it again, caught the railing to balance herself, and then said, in a rusty voice: “Did [MASK] leave his keys in the bank vault?”
