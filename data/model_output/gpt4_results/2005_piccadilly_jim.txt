<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Ann	He avoided [MASK]'s gaze. "I can't think what you are making all this fuss about." "Th'n why did y' sit in at a plot to kidnap this boy?" "That, of course--ha, ha!--might seem at first sight to require a little explanation."
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	James	The family treats it as a joke. But [MASK] has such low tastes. Professional pugilists! I believe that many years ago it was not unfashionable for young men in Society to be seen about with such persons, but those days are over.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jimmy	It shone with relief and admiration, and it exhilarated [MASK] like wine. As she moved towards the stairs, he gave expression to his satisfaction by slapping his father on the back with a report that rang out like a pistol shot. "What was that?"
<name>Mame</name>	Mame	Celestine	"Say, he's a grand man!" A snort of uncompromising disapproval proceeded from the thin-lipped mouth beneath the eyes. But [MASK] was too full of her news to be discouraged. "I'm strong fer Jer!" she said.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jimmy	Probably the boat was full up anyway. . . . He walked into the office. "Have you anything left on the _Atlantic_ this trip?" The clerk behind the counter was quite the wrong sort of person for [MASK] to have had dealings with in his present mood.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Mitchell	She had the appearance of being absolutely untouched by his eloquence. "In fact," he concluded lamely, "he is very sorry." There was silence for a moment. "How do you come to know [MASK]?"
<name>Rollo</name>	Rollo	Ann	You see me nervous, diffident, tongue-tied. All this will wear off, however, and you will be surprised and delighted as you begin to understand my true self. Beneath the surface--I speak conservatively--I am a corker!" The door banged behind [MASK].
<name>Chew</name>	Chew	Buck	And he taught me to chew. I'd be tickled to death to have [MASK] get me again. But, if you're working on your own, all right. It's all the same to me, provided you meet me on the terms."
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jimmy	He had just fastened the shutters, when from the passage outside there came the unmistakeable sound of a footstep. CHAPTER XXII IN THE LIBRARY [MASK]'s first emotion on hearing the footstep was the crude instinct of self-preservation.
<name>Lucille</name>	Lucille	Ogden	The swiftness of recent events had left him a little dizzy, and he desired to think matters over and find out exactly what had happened. The only point which appeared absolutely clear to him in a welter of confusing occurrences was the fact that he had lost the chance of kidnapping [MASK].
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Jimmy	"It is perfectly original." "I'm certain I've heard it before somewhere." "If you have, that simply means that you must have associated with some sensible person." [MASK] was puzzled. "But why the grouch?" he asked.
<name>Charlie</name>	Charlie	Jimmy	"I'm on the wagon myself," he said apologetically. "So am I," said [MASK]. "It's the only way. No sense in always drinking and making a disgraceful exhibition of yourself in public!"
<name>Isabel</name>	Isabel	Teddy	"[MASK] would never forgive me." She got into the cab. "It's only because you have appealed to me to help you discuss your future," she said, as they drove off. "Nothing else would have induced me . . .
<name>Wiggins</name>	Wiggins	Bayliss	Would you like me to fetch the paper? I have it in my pantry." "I should say so. Trot a quick heat back with it. This wants looking into." [MASK] retired, to return immediately with the paper.
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Jimmy	[MASK] stopped short. He perceived difficulties in the way of explanation. "I happened to be down there," he resumed stoutly, "and that man came into the room with an electric torch and a blowpipe and began working on the safe--"
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Bayliss	Yet, if such is the case, how is it that I can't remember whether I murdered somebody or not last night? It isn't the sort of thing your sober man would lightly forget. Have you ever murdered anybody, [MASK]?"
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Bayliss	Every name in the English language had passed from his mind. And then from out of the dark came inspiration. "[MASK]," he croaked. The girl held out her hand. "Then we can introduce ourselves at last.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Bayliss	It all comes back to me. Out of pure kindness of heart I took young Bill Blake of the _Sun_ to supper at the Six Hundred last night. This is my reward. I suppose he thinks it funny. Newspaper men are a low lot, [MASK]."
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Jerry	"Who, as you know, got fired yesterday. [MASK] was to have done the rough work of the job. But, being fired, he was no longer available. I, therefore, offered to take his place. So here I am."
<name>He</name>	He	Jimmy	"I can't do that." "You must!" "I can't. One must play the game." [MASK] groped for words. "But in this case you mustn't--it's awful--in this special case--" He broke off.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Ann	" A note of acidity had crept into [MASK]'s voice. "It is perfectly original." "I'm certain I've heard it before somewhere." "If you have, that simply means that you must have associated with some sensible person."
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Ann	He found [MASK] staring amazedly at him, eyes wide and lips parted. "Odd, that!" he observed with a light carelessness which he admired extremely and of which he would not have believed himself capable. "I suppose I must be somebody's double.
<name>Sam</name>	Sam	Jimmy	He doesn't want the kid recognising him and squealing on him later." [MASK] was lost in admiration of his father's resource. "You think of everything, dad! That wouldn't have occurred to me. You certainly do take to Crime in the most wonderful way.
<name>Rollo</name>	Rollo	Jimmy	A few moments later the door opened. [MASK] looked up. It was not his father. It was a dangerous-looking female of uncertain age, dressed as a parlour-maid, who eyed him with what seemed to his conscience-stricken soul dislike and suspicion.
<name>Emily</name>	Emily	Nesta	"You put things crudely, but no doubt you are right." "You'll live with us, of course." "Thank you very much. This is the right spirit." "I'll have to talk to [MASK] about you.
<name>Strether</name>	Strether	Jimmy	She got into the cab. "It's only because you have appealed to me to help you discuss your future," she said, as they drove off. "Nothing else would have induced me . . ." "I know," said [MASK].
<name>Adrian</name>	Adrian	Jimmy	But her heart was running away with her, goaded on by the irony of it all. A veil seemed to have fallen from before her eyes, and she knew now why she had been drawn to [MASK] from the very first.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jerry	"I told [MASK] that nothing could happen to us except the loss of his place to him and being sent to my grandmother to me, but I'm bound to say I said that just to encourage him. Don't you think
<name>Geoffrey</name>	Geoffrey	Ogden	We have made no plans." "Indeed?" She broke off. [MASK], who had possessed himself of a bronze paper-knife, had begun to tap the vase with it. The ringing note thus produced appeared to please his young mind.
<name>Alright</name>	Alright	Delighted	I could have sworn it was him when you bumped into me. Say, are you doing anything?" "Nothing in particular." "Come and have a yarn. There's a place I know just round by here." "[MASK]."
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Francis	"A what?" "Surely you know? Asparagus Adjusters are the fellows who sell those rope-and-pulley affairs by means of which the Smart Set lower asparagus into their mouths--or rather [MASK] the footman does it for them, of course.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Ogden	"Not at all." "It will be such a splendid thing for [MASK], won't it?" "Admirable." "Now the only thing to do is just to see that we have got everything straight. How about this, for instance?
<name>Leopold</name>	Leopold	Ogden	Once [MASK] thinks you are a professional kidnapper, you won't have any difficulty at all. Get it into your head that he wants to be kidnapped. Surely you can tackle this light and attractive job? Why, it will be a treat for you to do a bit of character acting once more!"
<name>Roderick</name>	Roderick	Jimmy	A boat of some description was tooting reflectively far down the river. Such was the seductive influence of the time and the scene that [MASK] might have remained there indefinitely, weaving dreams, had he not been under the necessity of making his way down to the library.
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Speechless	[MASK] concern was limned on his young face. The commissionaire at the Piccadilly entrance of the restaurant touched his hat ingratiatingly, with the smug confidence of a man who is accustomed to getting sixpence a time for doing it.
<name>Ascher</name>	Ascher	Jimmy	" "Good work!" said [MASK], well satisfied. " . . . But not as the result of a sort of delirium. I believe in it as a sensible partnership between two friends who know each other well and trust each other.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ann	Concerts, picnics--all that sort of thing. I shan't mind going there. I have a nice singing-voice. I think I will try to make the glee-club." "I suppose we are breaking the law," said [MASK] seriously.
<name>Gerald</name>	Gerald	Ogden	"I was very surprised when your uncle telephoned me," she said. "I had not the slightest idea that you were coming over. I am very glad to see you." "Thank you." "This is your cousin, [MASK]."
<name>Compton</name>	Compton	Bayliss	"Most doubtless. Let me hear all." [MASK] resumed. He was one of those readers who, whether their subject be a murder case or a funny anecdote, adopt a measured and sepulchral delivery which gives a suggestion of tragedy and horror to whatever they read.
<name>Steve</name>	Steve	Jimmy	. blue chin . . . heavy eyebrows . . . I guess I can't do better than my old Chicago Ed. make-up. Say, [MASK], how am I to get to the kid?" "That'll be all right.
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jim	"You'd want me to make up for the part?" he asked wistfully. "Of course!" "You want me to do it to-night?" "At about two in the morning, I thought." "I'll do it, [MASK]!"
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jimmy	The room seemed to reel before [MASK]'s eyes. He felt as if a friend had wounded him in his tenderest feelings. He felt as if some loved one had smitten him over the back of the head with a sandbag.
<name>Bill</name>	Bill	Jimmy	She's filled the house with poets and that sort of thing. It will be a treat having you around. You're human! I don't see that we're going to make much of you now that you're here, but I'm darned glad you've come, [MASK]!"
<name>him</name>	him	Jerry	But suppose I can't persuade her to forgive [MASK]?" "I think she is certain to do anything you ask. You saw how friendly she was to you at lunch. I don't see how anything can have happened since lunch to change her."
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Ann	"In that case, there is no more to be said. I'd much rather hang about and try to get adopted by a millionaire, but if you insist on my working--Waiter!" "What do you want?" asked [MASK].
<name>Smith</name>	Smith	Pett	He picked one up at random and opened it. He threw it down disgustedly. It was poetry. This man [MASK] appeared to have a perfect obsession for poetry. One would never have suspected it, to look at him.
<name>Jack</name>	Jack	Taft	"It wasn't [MASK]. He only looks like him. It was that kid Ogden up where I work. He came butting into the gym, joshing me about--makin' pers'nal remarks till I kind of lost my goat, and the next thing I knew I was giving him his!"
<name>Olga</name>	Olga	Willie	"Surely, though, you won't let a thing that happened five years ago make so much difference?" "I shall never forgive you!" "And yet, a little while ago, when [MASK]'s bomb was about to go off, you flung yourself into my arms!"
<name>Thompson</name>	Thompson	Skinner	It was so absurd that he felt ashamed of entertaining it even for a moment. But strange things were happening these times, and it might be . . . "What sort of looking man is [MASK]?" "Oh, stout, clean-shaven.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Jimmy	"[MASK], you've got to pull up. Honest, you have. I don't care for myself. I like to see a boy having a good time. But your stepmother says you're apt to queer us with the people up top, the way you're going on.
<name>Winston</name>	Winston	Bingley	Docility and obedience would be demanded of him later, but not till the first agony had abated. She spoke soothingly to him. "I am glad we have had this talk, [MASK]. It is best that you should know. It will help you to realise your responsibilities.
<name>Jane</name>	Jane	Ann	They both turned. The butler was gazing rather coyly at a vision in a grey tailor-made suit. "Good evening, miss," he said doubtfully. [MASK] looked at him in astonishment, then broke into a smile. "How stupid of me!
<name>Anthony</name>	Anthony	Jimmy	Do you admit that you behaved abominably five years ago?" "Yes!" shouted [MASK]. "And that you've been behaving just as badly ever since?" "Yes!" "And that you are really a pretty awful sort of person?"
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Bayliss	If [MASK] had not been within earshot, she would probably have sung a bar or two. Her amiability extended even to her step-son, though she had not altered her intention of speaking eloquently to him on certain matters when she could get hold of him.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Bayliss	"Don't be flippant, [MASK]," he protested. "Try to cure yourself of this passion for being funny at the wrong time. Your comedy is good, but tact is a finer quality than humour. Perhaps you think
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Bayliss	He stood at the foot of the stairs, yawning cavernously. "[MASK]," he said, "have you been painting yourself yellow?" "No, sir." "Strange! Your face looks a bright gamboge to me, and your outlines wobble.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Percy	I had no idea you would care. I wouldn't have done a fool thing like that for a million dollars if I'd known. Isn't there anything I can do? Gee whiz! I'll go right round to [MASK] now and apologise.
<name>Snell</name>	Snell	Ogden	"Oh, a gentleman who knew what was what." [MASK] closed the door. "Well, I know what's what, too. I know what you are for one thing." He chuckled. "I've got your number all right."
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Jimmy	Nothing is so capable of diversity as the emotion we feel on seeing our name unexpectedly in print. We may soar to the heights or we may sink to the depths. [MASK] did the latter. A mere cursory first inspection of the article revealed the fact that it was no eulogy.
<name>Jupiter</name>	Jupiter	Aida	"It will be a pleasure." He held out his hand, drawing it back rapidly as the dog [MASK] made a snap at it. Substituting a long-range leave-taking for the more intimate farewell, he left the room.
<name>Paul</name>	Paul	Jimmy	Do you want people to hear?" [MASK] drew a deep breath. "I shall have to get further away from you," he said more quietly. "There's no knowing what may happen if I don't. I don't want to kill you.
<name>Jimmy</name>	Jimmy	Clarence	"Wish y' luck! Ah! 'twas a wig. Gimme those spect'cles." She surveyed the results of her handiwork grimly. "Say, [MASK]," she remarked, "y're a wise guy. Y' look handsomer with 'em on.
<name>Al</name>	Al	Skinner	"You beat 't back t' y'r little bed, honey, like y'r aunt says. Y' say y' told this guy t' steal th' kid. Well, what about this here [MASK]? Y' didn't tell _him_, did y'?"
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Umps	"[MASK], I take it, sir, is what we would call the umpire?" "Call him anything you like. It's part of the game. Now here's the box, where I've put this dab of marmalade, and here's the pitcher, winding up."
<name>Hardy</name>	Hardy	Jimmy	It became apparent to [MASK], as he leaned over the rail and tried to pierce the darkness, that there was sinister work afoot; and he had hardly reached this conclusion when his mind took a further leap and he guessed the identity of the soft-footed person below.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	She looked hopefully at her niece, waiting for more, but [MASK] had said her say. "You are perfectly right, my dear child," she said when she was quite sure the eulogy was not to be resumed. "
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Jimmy	He was looking for the young master. [MASK] clove the crowd like a one-man flying-wedge. Two fruit and bun boys who impeded his passage drifted away like leaves on an Autumn gale. "Good man!" He possessed himself of the suitcase.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Jimmy	Then his eye fell upon the date on the title page, and a strong spasm of relief shook him. The clouds rolled away, and he loved her still. This frightful volume had been published five years ago. A wave of pity swept over [MASK].
<name>half-Nelson</name>	half-Nelson	Fitzsimmons	Both men sparred cautiously, being hampered in their movements by the fact, which neither had at this stage of the proceedings perceived, that they were on opposite sides of the disputed table. A clever [MASK]' shift on the part of the Battler removed this obstacle, and some brisk work ensued in neutral territory.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jimmy	"I fixed it after I was in." There was a faint scraping sound, followed by a click. The darkness of the room was relieved by moonlight. The figures passed through. [MASK] ran down from the gallery, and closed the windows softly.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Bayliss	The hands of the station clock pointed to ten minutes to six. The platform was a confused mass of travellers, porters, baggage, trucks, boys with buns and fruits, boys with magazines, friends, relatives, and [MASK] the butler, standing like a faithful watchdog beside a large suitcase.
<name>Marjorie</name>	Marjorie	Ann	It may be a respectable occupation, but it sounds rather criminal to me. The sentence for forging drops is probably about twenty years with hard labour." "I wish you would put that book away and go on with your lunch," said [MASK]. "
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Jimmy	"You said you would promise me anything." "Anything but that." "Then it is all off!" [MASK] pondered. "It's terribly tame that way." "Never mind. It's the only way I will consider."
<name>Rollo</name>	Rollo	Jimmy	In face of this repulse, [MASK]'s campaign broke down. He was at a loss to know what to do next. He ebbed away from the Duke's front door like an army that has made an unsuccessful frontal attack on an impregnable fortress.
<name>Rollo</name>	Rollo	Jimmy	Having launched his indulgent parent safely on a career of crime, [MASK] switched off the light and returned to the window. Leaning out, he gave himself up for a moment to sentimental musings. The night was very still.
<name>Moriarty</name>	Moriarty	Skinner	"Exactly. It goes to prove that what I said about [MASK] was correct. They are working together. The thing is self-evident. Look at it from your point of view. How simple it is.
<name>Lucy</name>	Lucy	Ann	[MASK] walked on to her compartment. She felt as if she had just read a whole long novel, one of those chunky younger-English-novelist things. She knew the whole story as well as if it had been told to her in detail.
<name>Archie</name>	Archie	Jimmy	She regretted this thrust a little, for she felt it might put the man on his guard by showing that she suspected something but she could not resist it, and it pleased her to see that her companion was momentarily confused. "I met him when I was going for my luggage," said [MASK].
<name>Wimsey</name>	Wimsey	Bayliss	" when they meant "'at-a-boy!" "[MASK], do you play cricket?" "I am a little past the age, sir. In my younger days . . ." "Do you understand it?" "
<name>Harold</name>	Harold	Jimmy	Exhaustive as had been the thought which [MASK]'s father had given to the possible developments of his enterprise, this was a contingency of which he had not dreamed. He was entirely at a loss. "Don't do that!" he said huskily.
<name>Jim</name>	Jim	Jimmy	No, I guess I'm going to get mine all right, and the only thing to do is to keep it from stopping me having a good time now." There was truth in what he said, and [MASK] recognised it. He changed the subject.
<name>him</name>	him	Mitchell	I am interested to know when you did see [MASK]?" She regretted this thrust a little, for she felt it might put the man on his guard by showing that she suspected something but she could not resist it, and it pleased her to see that her companion was momentarily confused.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	Jimmy	she said in concern. "But I meant it, every word. I love to hear you talk. You have such _feeling!_" [MASK] attuned himself to the key of the conversation. "Have you no sentiment in you?" he demanded.
<name>Wilmot</name>	Wilmot	Ann	"I used to be as sentimental as any one a few years ago," said [MASK], returning to the dropped subject. "Just after I left college, I was quite maudlin. I dreamed of moons and Junes and loves and doves all the time.
<name>Harley</name>	Harley	Bayliss	139 [MASK] inspected the cipher gravely. "What is it you wish me to explain, sir?" "Why, the whole thing. What's it all about?" "It's perfectly simple, sir.
<name>Algernon</name>	Algernon	James	It was outrageous that [MASK] should have been seen in public at all with such a person. The man had a broken nose and talked through it. He was saying in a loud voice that made everybody turn round something about his left-scissors hook--whatever that may have been.
<name>Mike</name>	Mike	Jimmy	[MASK] heaved himself painfully off the sofa, blinked, and set out for the den, where his father, in a deep arm-chair, was smoking a restful pipe and reading the portions of the daily papers which did not deal with the game of cricket.
<name>Ukridge</name>	Ukridge	Jimmy	[MASK] read the thing through in its entirety three times before he appreciated a _nuance_ which his disordered mind had at first failed to grasp--to wit, that this character-sketch of himself was no mere isolated outburst but apparently one of a series.
<name>Jeeves</name>	Jeeves	Jimmy	"Beg pardon, sir?" "Always drinking," explained [MASK], "and making a pest of himself." He passed on. The commissionaire stared after him as intently as the waiter and the hat-check boy.
<name>Thurber</name>	Thurber	Jimmy	"The immediate cause of the encounter had to do with a disputed table, which each gladiator claimed to have engaged in advance over the telephone." "I begin to remember," said [MASK] meditatively. "A pill with butter-coloured hair tried to jump my claim.
<name>Bertie</name>	Bertie	Jimmy	And then memory, in its usual eccentric way, having taken all this time to make the first part of the journey, finished the rest of it with one lightning swoop, and he knew. And with the illumination came dismay. Worse than dismay. Horror. "Gosh!" said [MASK].
<name>Reginald</name>	Reginald	Jimmy	[MASK] eyed her fixedly. He disapproved of this frivolity. "One of these days you will try me too high--!" "Oh, you didn't hear what I was saying to my friend, did you?" she said in concern.
<name>Pinkerton's</name>	Pinkerton's	Anderson	Shall I tell you something about him? You perhaps know that when the big detective agencies, [MASK]'s and the others, are approached in the matter of tracing a man who is wanted for anything they sometimes ask the smaller agencies like my own to work in with them.
<name>Jenkins</name>	Jenkins	Jimmy	The fair-haired young man opened the proceedings by going to the door and looking out. This done, he returned to his seat and gazed fixedly at [MASK]. "What's your game?" he asked.
<name>Wickham</name>	Wickham	Gee	"[MASK]! He's beat it in my bubble! And it was a hired one!" The words seemed to relieve the tension in the air. One by one the company became masters of themselves once more.
<name>Raffles</name>	Raffles	Jimmy	What he was doing to the safe, [MASK] could not see, for the man's body was in the way; but the electric torch shone on his face, lighting up grim, serious features quite unlike the amiable and slightly vacant mask which his lordship was wont to present to the world.
<name>Mary</name>	Mary	Ann	"Cold?" he said. "Let's walk on." [MASK]'s sense of humour reasserted itself. It was not often that it remained dormant for so long. She laughed. "I know exactly what you are thinking," she said.
<name>He</name>	He	Jimmy	I would not dream of such a thing." "He's full of remorse, you know." "If he has a spark of humanity, I have no doubt of it." [MASK] paused. This thing was not coming out as well as it might have done.
<name>He</name>	He	Jerry	"Why?" he said, retrieving a morsel of jam from his right cheek with the tip of his tongue. "To keep in condition." "Why do you want to keep in condition?" [MASK] flung the gloves into their locker.
<name>Scott</name>	Scott	Godfrey	Take him off to bed now. To-morrow you can start looking up schools. Great [MASK]!" He hopped to the writing-desk and glared disgustedly at the _debris_ on it. "Who's been making this mess on my desk?
